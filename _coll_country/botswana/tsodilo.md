    body: 'Tsodilo Hills, located in north-west Botswana, contains around 400 rock
      art sites with more than 4,000 individual paintings, and has been termed the
      “The Louvre of the Desert”.  Designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2001,
      Tsodilo comprises four main hill: Male Hill, Female Hill, Child Hill and North
      Hill with paintings occurring on all four. This region shows human occupation
      going back 100,000 years.  At sunset the western cliffs of the Hills radiate
      a glowing light that can be seen for miles around, for which the local Juc’hoansi  call
      them the “Copper Bracelet of the Evening”.'

    title: Rock Art
    title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 2'
    body: The paintings at Tsodilo are unique in comparison to other San&#124;Bushmen
      rock art in both techniques and subject matter. San&#124;Bushmen paintings are
      well-known throughout southern Africa for their fine-line detail because they
      were brush painted, but those at Tsodilo are finger painted. In addition, 160
      depictions of cattle are portrayed in the same style as wild animals, and more
      geometric designs appear here than anywhere else. Tsodilo animal drawings are
      larger and the geometric designs simpler than those found elsewhere.  In comparison
      to human figures elsewhere in southern Africa, those at Tsodilo appear without
      bows and arrows, clothing or any forms of personal ornamentation.  In addition,
      numerous cupules and grooves are incised and ground into rock surfaces, sometimes
      close to painted rock art sites and some on their own. For the residents of
      Tsodilo, the hills are a sacred place inhabited by spirits of the ancestors.

      animals, human figures and geometric designs. Unusually, animals, mainly large
      mammals and cattle have been depicted in twisted perspective with two horns
      and two or four legs displayed in silhouette. '

    body: While most of the images in the Tsodilo Hills seem to be discrete depictions,
      some sites show figures. Some of these figures are with cattle as well as women
      standing in rows in connection with animal groups, possibly showing some relationship
      with each other. Additionally, some of the rock art in the Tsodilo Hills shows
      superimposition, but this occurs infrequently. In some cases red geometric designs
      superimpose animals, but geometric designs and animals never superimpose human
      figures, nor do images of cattle ever superimpose other images – which may suggest
      some kind of relationship or hierarchy.

    body: White finger-painted images appear more crudely executed and are made from
      a powdery or greasy white pigment. More than 200 paintings at 20 different sites
      show paintings in this style, half of these depictions occur in White Paintings
      Shelter alone. Subject matter includes people facing forwards with their hands
      on hips, figures riding horses, a possible wagon wheel and a figure standing
      on a wagon, as well as an elephant, rhino, giraffe, eland, cows, antelope, snakes,
      unidentified animals and geometric designs, particularly “m” shapes. White paintings
      occur at sites with red paintings and often superimpose them.

    title: Cupules/Grooves
    title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 8'
    body: There are no engravings at Tsodilo representing animals or human figures,
      but more than 25 sites show evidence of small round depressions ground into
      the rock, known as cupules, as well as various shaped grooves that have been
      chipped and ground into the rock. The majority of sites are found on Female
      Hill, with four on Male Hill and one site on Child Hill. Cupules tend to measure
      about 5cm or more wide and less than a 1cm deep, although larger examples occur.
      They can occur at painted rock art sites but also on their own. For the most
      part they are found in groups ranging from 5 to 100 and in three cases, considerably
      more. For example, in Rhino Cave there are 346 carved into a vertical wall and
      nearly 1,100 at Depression Shelter. The purpose or meaning of cupules is unknown;
      they may have denoted a special place or the number of times a site had been
      visited. However, we have no dates for any of the cupules and even if they are
      adjacent to a rock art site, they are not necessarily contemporaneous. From
      their patina and general wear it has been proposed that some cupules may date
      back tens of thousands of years to the Middle Stone Age. If paintings also existed
      at this time they have long since disappeared.

      occur in small groups of 3 to 15 and are elongated oval or canoe-like in shape,
      and are found mostly on horizontal or near-horizontal surfaces. Their function
      is unknown, although a thin slab of stone with a curved round edge was excavated
      from Depression Shelter which matched one of the grooves in the shelter.

    title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 10'
    body: "It is a bit of a mystery about who actually created the paintings at Tsodilo,
      as the red images at Tsodilo do not fit neatly into other known styles of rock
      art in southern Africa. They do not show the fine brush work of San&#124;Bushmen¹
      in other parts of southern Africa, nor the cruder style of white paintings attributed
      to later Bantu-speaking farmers.\n\nIt is possible that they were painted by
      the Khoesan during the first millennium AD, the original settlers in the area
      who made stone tools and herded livestock. A local Ncaekhoe man (a Central San
      people) claims his ancestors made the paintings and it is possible that some
      or many of the cattle images were painted by pastoral ancestors of Ncaekhoe.
      \n\nThe white paintings are more difficult to attribute authorship, although
      as they are comparable to the red paintings, comprising the same subject matter
      of elephant, rhino, giraffe and antelope as well as geometrics, they may reflect
      a later version of the red tradition.\n\n"

    title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 11'
    body: The paintings at Tsodilo are often faded because they are located on rock
      faces exposed to the sun, wind and rain. As such, dating them scientifically
      is problematic as little or no suitable organic material remains. However, cattle
      paintings may help to date the art. There are about 160 depictions of cattle,
      which were common around the Tsodilo Hills between 800–1200 AD. As the cattle
      depictions are stylistically similar to other animal depictions it has been
      suggested that this seems to be a plausible date for most of the art (Coulson
      and Campbell, 2001:103)

      this could have occurred in the twelfth century when Tsodilo stopped being a
      major trade centre and seemingly the local cattle population collapsed. '

    body: "Giraffe, eland and rhino are by far the most common species depicted at
      Tsodilo, followed by elephant, gemsbok and cattle. However, these images tend
      to be discretely rendered and there does not appear to be any relationship between
      images on the same rock. \n\nRepresentations of people are simply painted and
      generally stick-like, identified to gender by either penis or breasts. In some
      cases this may represent sexual virility and fertility, although in scenes where
      both occur it may merely indicate gender differences.\n\nCattle seem to appear
      in the rock art at the same time as human figures. In one scene, three figures,
      one leading a child, has been interpreted as either herding or stealing cattle
      (Campbell, Robbins and Taylor, 2010:106). Three other sites show cattle depicted
      with what may be mythical rain animals. \n"

    body: "Geometric designs are trickier to decipher.  Square geometric designs,
      also known as “shields” possibly represent human forms. Circular designs sometimes
      partially superimpose an animal or be placed within its outline. This superimposition
      may enhance the symbolic meaning of the animal.\n\nEither singly or in groups,
      and sometimes depicted with animals or people, geometric motifs show stylistic
      consistency across a wide area and are likely to have had some symbolic meaning.
      In Zambia, geometric designs are thought to have been made by women and associated
      with the weather and fertility, while depictions of animals were made by men.
      The geometric rock art of Tsodilo fits into a pattern of similar imagery in
      central Africa and may be related to the same meanings of weather and fertility.\t\n"

      hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages

      terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted
      them."
