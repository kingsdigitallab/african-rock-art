      body: At the nexus of Sudan, Libya and Egypt, where the borders meet at a point
        in the Eastern Sahara, a large rocky outcrop known as Jebel Uweinat peaks
        at an elevation of nearly 2,000 metres. The massif consists of a large, ring-shaped
        granite mass in the west, with sandstone plateaus in the east divided by deep
        valleys. Jebel Uweinat is so isolated that, until 1923, the proliferation
        of rock art around it had never been documented.

      body: This rock art comes in the form of paintings and engravings, commonly
        of animals and overwhelmingly of domestic cattle – 337 painted sites out of
        414 that have been counted contain depictions of cattle and cattle herds,
        and there are many further engravings of them. There is a disparity in the
        spread of each artwork technique – the engravings are predominantly at lower
        levels than the paintings, near the base of the mountain and valley floors,
        with the paintings at greater altitude. The images shown here come from Karkur
        Talh, the largest of these valleys, which lies mostly in Sudan.

        in various styles, as well as other domesticates, including goats and dogs.
        The herds of cattle clearly reflect a pastoralist existence for the artists,
        but there are also indications of hunting taking place, through engravings
        of wild antelope and dog figures, as well as many engravings of camels.

      body: This variety, and similarities to rock art sites elsewhere in the eastern
        Sahara, has led to conjecture and debate regarding the date and authorship
        of these depictions. Were the engravings and paintings made by the same people?
        Does the difference in drawing styles signify authorship by different cultures
        and at different times? The difficulties in objective dating of rock art make
        these questions difficult to answer, but it seems likely that there was a
        long tradition of painting and engraving here, with much of the ‘pastoralist’
        rock art with cattle probably made between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago, some
        earlier styles possibly as much as 8,500 years ago, and other images such
        as camels made only about 2,000 years ago or less.

      title_internal: 'Sudan: featured site, chapter 5'
      body: Other than giraffes, the lack of large wild animals depicted (e.g. elephants)
        may indicate the climate to have been too dry for them, as during this time
        the area fluctuated in aridity, eventually becoming desert. There are, however,
        permanent springs at Jebel Uweinat and a more temperate microclimate here
        may have allowed pastoralists to subsist while the surrounding area became
        inhospitable. Indeed, despite its present remoteness, evidence suggests millennia
        of successive human presence, and as recently as the early 20th century, herders
        of the Toubou peoples were reported to be still living in the area. The camel
        engravings cannot be much older than 2,000 years, because camels were unknown
        in Africa before that, and the recent discovery of an ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic
        inscription from the Early Middle Kingdom serves to confirm that Jebel Uweinat
        has never really been ‘undiscovered’, despite having been unknown to Western
        geographers prior to the 20th century.

      title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 2'
      body: Sudan covers nearly 2,000,000 km² and is geographically diverse, dominated
        in the north by the desert of the southern Sahara and divided by the River
        Nile, which flows north from the capital city of Khartoum at the confluence
        of the Blue and White Niles and is joined by the Atbara River in the east.
        East of the Nile is the arid Nubian Desert, which is part of the larger Sahara,
        flanked at the north east by the Red Sea Hills and at the south by clay plains.
        To the south and west of the country are semi-arid zones with seasonal watercourses,
        with the west dominated by the Jebel Marrah volcanic massif, and the Nuba
        mountain range near the southern border.

      title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 3'
      body: Historically, rock art research in Sudan has either been incorporated
        into larger investigations of the area’s rich archaeological history, or,
        as in the Nubian Nile valley, the result of archaeological salvage projects,
        aimed at documenting and conserving archaeological sites and artefacts in
        advance of engineered flooding events, such as the construction of the Aswan
        High dam in the 1960s and the Merowe dam in the early 2000s. This has resulted
        in significant rock art and rock gong discoveries, such as that noted near
        the Second Cataract (Žába, 1967) and more recently around the Fourth. Rock
        art remains vulnerable to damming initiatives – that at Sabu is currently
        under threat by the Kajbar Dam proposal at the Third Cataract. There is great
        scope for further research.

      title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 4'
      body: |-
        The rock art of Sudan is varied across both time periods and geographical regions. Numerous pecked depictions of domestic cattle can be found in the Red Sea Hills (Pluskota, 2006) as well as depictions of both domestic and wild animals closer to the River Nile, such as those found at Jebel Gorgod in a mountainous area near Sesebi (Schiff Giorgini, 1972). Engravings, like those around the Second, Third, and Fourth Cataracts (areas of rocky rapids) are varied in subject matter and in date, ranging from Neolithic engravings of wild and domestic fauna to those with Medieval Christian imagery, for example around the Dal Cataract (Mills, 1965). These are mixed with others from about 4,000 BC onwards which may be contemporary with the Predynastic cultures and Pharaonic periods of ancient Egypt and in northern Sudan, Nubian Kerma culture (known to the ancient Egyptians as the Kingdom of Kush). These include depictions of Nile river boats and later hieroglyphic inscriptions.

        The peripatetic nature of these traceable signatures highlights the need to look beyond modern boundaries when considering ancient rock art traditions of Africa. For millennia prior to the creation of the current Egypt/Sudan border, the highway of the river allowed movement between Egypt and Nubia, the people of the region leaving their marks on a narrow area of fertile land that fostered riverine animals like crocodiles, which are occasionally depicted in the rock engravings. From the 4th millennium BC, following several temperate millennia, savannah animals like giraffe lost their habitat in the increasingly arid environments to east and west, but remain reflected in the rock engravings of what is now desert.

        The range in styles and dates for Sudanese rock art emphasises its nature, not as a particular artistic style, but as personal and cultural manipulations of a specific medium. A number of stone percussive instruments known as rock gongs, which produce a sonorous tone when struck and are often apparently associated with cattle engravings, have stimulated discussion about the uses of rock art sites as multisensory ritual venues.

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 5'
      body: The understanding of much of Sudanese prehistory as it relates to rock
        art remains subject to debate. Some of the best-preserved and most varied
        rock art of Sudan’s desert regions is situated only metres from the Egyptian
        border in the far north-west corner of the country, in a valley of Jebel Uweinat
        – the enormous sandstone and granite outcrop which serves as a boundary between
        Egypt, Sudan and Libya. Numerous paintings and engravings are found here,
        including images of wild animals, such as giraffe and antelope, humans, dogs
        and many cattle. Some of these paintings have been compared with other styles
        of rock art in the wider Sahara, including the later Pastoral Period (Muzzolini,
        1995). Others have proposed that a different set of paintings in these sites
        may be older, with a stylistic link (although fragile) with the Round Head
        Period (Van Noten,1978). However, the scholarly community recognises the inherent
        difficulty of formulating conclusions of direct links with wider rock art
        practices. In areas around the Nile, where there are similar animal engravings,
        rock art is also from a wide range of time periods.

      body: 'Ascribing dates to rock art like that at Jebel Uweinat is also uncertain
        and is more difficult than dating images such as the depictions of Nile river
        boats or later Christian cross engravings like those found near the Third
        Cataract, where similar motifs are replicated on contemporary pottery and
        corroborated elsewhere in the archaeological record. Occasionally rock art
        may be found in a dateable stratigraphic context- a giraffe engraving at Gala
        Abu Ahmed in Wadi Howar, an ancient Nile tributary, was recently dated to
        before 1,200-1,300 BC in this way (Jesse, 2005). In general, other clues are
        necessary, for example known domestication dates: wild animal images are often
        superseded with depictions of animals like horses and camels. These were only
        widely known in northeast Africa from the second and first millennia BC respectively
        and are therefore unlikely to be older. However, this is not an exact science:
        examination of the superimpositions and levels of patination on some Nile
        valley cattle engravings show that they were made over thousands of years
        up to the not too distant past. Faced with such challenges, classifying rock
        art by design style, while problematic, can prove useful in envisioning chronology.'
