      body: At the nexus of Sudan, Libya and Egypt, where the borders meet at a point
        in the Eastern Sahara, a large rocky outcrop known as Jebel Uweinat peaks
        at an elevation of nearly 2,000 metres. The massif consists of a large, ring-shaped
        granite mass in the west, with sandstone plateaus in the east divided by deep
        valleys. Jebel Uweinat is so isolated that, until 1923, the proliferation
        of rock art around it had never been documented.

      body: This rock art comes in the form of paintings and engravings, commonly
        of animals and overwhelmingly of domestic cattle – 337 painted sites out of
        414 that have been counted contain depictions of cattle and cattle herds,
        and there are many further engravings of them. There is a disparity in the
        spread of each artwork technique – the engravings are predominantly at lower
        levels than the paintings, near the base of the mountain and valley floors,
        with the paintings at greater altitude. The images shown here come from Karkur
        Talh, the largest of these valleys, which lies mostly in Sudan.

        in various styles, as well as other domesticates, including goats and dogs.
        The herds of cattle clearly reflect a pastoralist existence for the artists,
        but there are also indications of hunting taking place, through engravings
        of wild antelope and dog figures, as well as many engravings of camels.

      body: This variety, and similarities to rock art sites elsewhere in the eastern
        Sahara, has led to conjecture and debate regarding the date and authorship
        of these depictions. Were the engravings and paintings made by the same people?
        Does the difference in drawing styles signify authorship by different cultures
        and at different times? The difficulties in objective dating of rock art make
        these questions difficult to answer, but it seems likely that there was a
        long tradition of painting and engraving here, with much of the ‘pastoralist’
        rock art with cattle probably made between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago, some
        earlier styles possibly as much as 8,500 years ago, and other images such
        as camels made only about 2,000 years ago or less.

      title_internal: 'Sudan: featured site, chapter 5'
      body: Other than giraffes, the lack of large wild animals depicted (e.g. elephants)
        may indicate the climate to have been too dry for them, as during this time
        the area fluctuated in aridity, eventually becoming desert. There are, however,
        permanent springs at Jebel Uweinat and a more temperate microclimate here
        may have allowed pastoralists to subsist while the surrounding area became
        inhospitable. Indeed, despite its present remoteness, evidence suggests millennia
        of successive human presence, and as recently as the early 20th century, herders
        of the Toubou peoples were reported to be still living in the area. The camel
        engravings cannot be much older than 2,000 years, because camels were unknown
        in Africa before that, and the recent discovery of an ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic
        inscription from the Early Middle Kingdom serves to confirm that Jebel Uweinat
        has never really been ‘undiscovered’, despite having been unknown to Western
        geographers prior to the 20th century.

        notably the Fezzan region, and include paintings of chariots in a variety
        of forms dating to the Horse Period, from up to 3,000 years ago. This has
        stimulated some interesting questions about the use of chariots in what appears
        to be such a seemingly inappropriate environment for a wheeled vehicle, as
        well as the nature of representation. Why were chariots used in the desert
        and why were they represented in such different ways?

      body: The chariot has been one of the great empowering innovations of history.
        It likely originated in Mesopotamia about 3000 BC due to advances in metallurgy
        during the Bronze Age, and has served as a primary means of transport until
        quite recently in the historical period across Africa, Eurasia and Europe.
        Chariots provided rapid and efficient transport, and were ideal for the battlefield
        as the design provided a raised firing platform for archers . As a result
        the chariot became the principal war machine from the Egyptians through to
        the Romans; and the Chinese, who owned an army of 10,000 chariots. Indeed,
        our use of the word car is a derivative of the Latin word carrus, meaning
        ‘a chariot of war or of triumph’.

      body: The chariot in the Sahara was probably introduced by the Garamantes, a
        cultural group thought to be descended from Berbers and Saharan pastoralists.
        There is little textual information about the Garamantes, documentation comes
        mainly from Greek and Roman sources. Herodotus described them as ‘a very great
        nation’. Recent archaeological research has shown that the Garamantes established
        about eight major towns as well as numerous other settlements, and were ‘brilliant
        farmers, resourceful engineers, and enterprising merchants’. The success of
        the Garamantes was based on their subterranean water-extraction system, a
        network of underground tunnels, allowing the Garamantian culture to flourish
        in an increasingly arid environment, resulting in population expansion, urbanisation,
        and conquest.

      body: On average there are about 500 drawings of chariots across the Sahara,
        from the Fezzan in Libya through the Aïr of Niger into northern Mali and then
        westward to the Atlantic coast; but not all were produced by the Garamantes.
        It is still not certain that chariots were driven along the routes where their
        depictions occur; remains of chariots have never been found west of the Fezzan.
        However, the Fezzan states were thriving trade routes and chariots are likely
        to have been used to transport salt, cloth, beads and metal goods in exchange
        for gold, ivory and slaves. The widespread occurrence of chariot imagery on
        Saharan rock outcrops has led to the proposition of ‘chariot routes’ linking
        North and West Africa. However, these vehicles were not suited for long-distance
        transport across desert terrain; more localised use is probable, conducted
        through middlemen who were aware of the trade routes through the desert landscape.
        Additionally, the horse at this time was a prestige animal and it is unlikely
        that they facilitated transport across the Saharan trade routes, with travellers
        rather utilising donkeys or oxen.

      body: The absence of archaeological evidence for chariots has led to the suggestion
        that some representations of chariots may have been the result of cultural
        diffusion, transmitted orally by nomadic peoples traversing the region. Artists
        may never have actually seen the vehicles themselves. If this is the case,
        chariot symbols may have acquired some special meaning above their function
        as modes of transport. It may also explain why some representations of chariots
        do not seem to conform to more conventional styles of representations and
        account for the different ways in which they were depicted.

        The two images may or may not depict chariots. The rectangular shapes are potentially abstracted forms of the chariot similar to the ‘flattened out’ depictions discussed previously. These potentially abstracted representations often sit alongside distinguishing figures, such as geometric bi-triangular figures, spears or lances, women wearing long dresses, and animals drawn in a fairly naturalistic style, of the Horse Period when the chariots were being used.

        Beside the schematic and simply depicted chariots, there is also a group which has been termed the ‘flying gallop chariots’. Their distribution includes the whole Tassili region, although there are fewer in the Acacus Mountains. They resemble the classical two-wheeled antique chariots, generally drawn by two horses, but sometimes three, or even four. The driver is usually alone, and is depicted in a typical style with a stick head. The majority are shown at full speed, with the driver holding a whip standing on a small platform, sometimes straining forward.

        In a similar manner to the schematic chariots, the 'Flying Gallop' depictions display the entire platform and both wheels of the chariot. In addition, more than one horse is depicted as a single horse in profile with numerous legs indicating multiple horses; an artistic technique first seen during the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe. Interestingly, in the Libyan rock art of the Acacus Mountains it seemed that animals could be conceived of in profile and in movement, but chariots were conceived of differently, and are represented in plain view, seen from above or in three-quarters perspective.

        Why are chariots depicted in a variety of ways, and what can we say about the nature of representation in relation to chariots? It is clear that chariots are able to be depicted in profile view, yet there are variations that digress from this perspective. In relation to the few examples we have come across so far in the Acacus Mountains in south-western Libya, one observation we might make is that the ways in which chariots have been represented may be indicative of the ways in which they have been observed by the artists representing them; as a rule from above. The rock shelters in the Acacus are often some height above the now dried up wadis, and so the ways in which they conceived of representing the chariot itself , whether as a flying gallop chariot, a chariot drawn by a bovid or as an abstraction, may have become a particular representational convention. The ways in which animals were represented conformed also to a convention, one that had a longer tradition, but chariots were an innovation and may have been represented as they were observed; from higher up in the rockshelters; thus chariots were conceived of as a whole and from an aerial perspective. The ways in which environments affect our perceptions of dimension, space and colour are now well-established, initially through cross-cultural anthropological studies in the 1960s, and becoming better understood through more recent research concerning the brain. Of course, this is speculation, and further research would be needed to consider all the possibilities. But for now, we can start to see some intriguing lines of enquiry and research areas that these images have stimulated.

      body: Vast trading networks across the Sahara Desert not only facilitated the
        spread of goods, but the routes served as a conduit for cultural diffusion
        through the spread of knowledge, ideas and technologies. Chariots were both
        functional and symbolic. As a mode of transport, as a weapon of war, as a
        means of trade and exchange and as a symbol of power, the chariot has been
        a cultural artefact for 4,000 years. Its temporal and spatial reach is evident
        not only in the rock art, but through the British Museum collections, which
        reveal comparisons between 2D rock art and 3D artefacts. Similarities and
        adjacencies occur not only in the structure and design of the chariots themselves
        but in their symbolic and pragmatic nature.

      body: |-
        The rock art of eastern Africa is characterised by a wide range of non-figurative images, broadly defined as geometric. Occurring in a number of different patterns or designs, they are thought to have been in existence in this region for thousands of years, although often it is difficult to attribute the art to particular cultural groups. Geometric rock art is difficult to interpret, and designs have been variously associated with sympathetic magic, symbols of climate or fertility and altered states of consciousness (Coulson and Campbell, 2010:220). However, in some cases the motifs painted or engraved on the rock face resemble the same designs used for branding livestock and are intimately related to people’s lives and world views in this region.

        First observed in Kenya in the 1970s with the work of Gramly (1975) at Lukenya Hill and Lynch and Robbins (1977) at Namoratung’a, some geometric motifs seen in the rock art of the region were observed to have had their counterparts on the hides of cattle of local communities. Although cattle branding is known to be  practised by several Kenyan groups, Gramly concluded that  “drawing cattle brands on the walls of rock shelters appears to be confined to the regions formerly inhabited by the Maa-speaking pastoralists or presently occupied by them”&dagger;(Gramly, 1977:117).

      body: In the case of Lukenya Hill, the rock shelters on whose walls these geometric
        symbols occur are associated with meat-feasting ceremonies. Meat-feasting
        shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are
        places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat
        in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle.
        During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were
        painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand
        their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners,
        but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease.
        Different symbols may be used for male and female animals.

        of geometric motifs. Some of these motifs bear a striking resemblance to the
        brand marks that the Turkana mark on their cattle, camels, donkeys and other
        livestock in the area, although local people claim no authorship for the funerary
        engravings (Russell, 2013:4).

      body: Recent research (Russell, 2013) has shown that at Namoratung’a the branding
        of animals signifies a sense of belonging rather than a mark of ownership
        as we understand it in a modern farming context; all livestock, cattle, camel,
        goats, sheep and donkeys are branded according to species and sex (Russell,
        2013:7). Ethnographic accounts document that clan membership can only be determined
        by observing someone with their livestock (Russell, 2013:9). The symbol itself
        is not as important as the act of placing it on the animal’s skin, and local
        people have confirmed that they never mark rock with brand marks. Thus, the
        geometric motifs on the grave markers may have been borrowed by local Turkana
        to serve as identity markers, but in a different context. In the Horn of Africa,
        some geometric rock art is located in the open landscape and on graves. It
        has been suggested that these too are brand or clan marks, possibly made by
        camel keeping pastoralists to mark achievement, territory or ownership (Russell,
        2013:18). Some nomadic pastoralists, further afield, such as the Tuareg, place
        their clan marks along the routes they travel, carved onto salt blocks, trees
        and wells (Mohamed, 1990; Landais, 2001).

        of something else (Russell, 2013:17).  For example, informants from the Samburu
        people reported that while some of the painted motifs found at Samburu meat-feasting
        shelters were of cattle brands, others represented female headdresses or were
        made to mark an initiation, and in some Masai shelters there are also clear
        representations of warriors’ shields.  In Uganda, a ceremonial rock in Karamoja,
        shows a dung painting consisting of large circles bisected by a cross which
        is said to represent cattle enclosures (Robbins, 1972). Geometric symbols,
        painted in fat and red ochre, on large phallic-shaped fertility stones on
        the Mesakin and Korongo Hills in south Sudan indicate the sex of the child
        to whom prayers are offered (Bell, 1936). A circle bisected by a line or circles
        bisected by two crosses represent boys. Girls are represented by a cross (drawn
        diagonally) or a slanting line (like a forward slash)(Russell, 2013: 17).\n\nAlthough
        pastoralist geometric motifs are widespread in the rock art of eastern Africa,
        attempting to find the meaning behind geometric designs is problematic. The
        examples discussed here demonstrate that motifs can have multiple authors,
        even in the same location, and that identical symbols can be the products
        of very different behaviours. \n"

        in the north by the desert of the southern Sahara and divided by the River
        Nile, which flows north from the capital city of Khartoum at the confluence
        of the Blue and White Niles and is joined by the Atbara River in the east.
        East of the Nile is the arid Nubian Desert, which is part of the larger Sahara,
        flanked at the north east by the Red Sea Hills and at the south by clay plains.
        To the south and west of the country are semi-arid zones with seasonal watercourses,
        with the west dominated by the Jebel Marrah volcanic massif, and the Nuba
        mountain range near the southern border.

        as in the Nubian Nile valley, the result of archaeological salvage projects,
        aimed at documenting and conserving archaeological sites and artefacts in
        advance of engineered flooding events, such as the construction of the Aswan
        High dam in the 1960s and the Merowe dam in the early 2000s. This has resulted
        in significant rock art and rock gong discoveries, such as that noted near
        the Second Cataract (Žába, 1967) and more recently around the Fourth. Rock
        art remains vulnerable to damming initiatives – that at Sabu is currently
        under threat by the Kajbar Dam proposal at the Third Cataract. There is great
        scope for further research.

      body: |-
        The rock art of Sudan is varied across both time periods and geographical regions. Numerous pecked depictions of domestic cattle can be found in the Red Sea Hills (Pluskota, 2006) as well as depictions of both domestic and wild animals closer to the River Nile, such as those found at Jebel Gorgod in a mountainous area near Sesebi (Schiff Giorgini, 1972). Engravings, like those around the Second, Third, and Fourth Cataracts (areas of rocky rapids) are varied in subject matter and in date, ranging from Neolithic engravings of wild and domestic fauna to those with Medieval Christian imagery, for example around the Dal Cataract (Mills, 1965). These are mixed with others from about 4,000 BC onwards which may be contemporary with the Predynastic cultures and Pharaonic periods of ancient Egypt and in northern Sudan, Nubian Kerma culture (known to the ancient Egyptians as the Kingdom of Kush). These include depictions of Nile river boats and later hieroglyphic inscriptions.

        The peripatetic nature of these traceable signatures highlights the need to look beyond modern boundaries when considering ancient rock art traditions of Africa. For millennia prior to the creation of the current Egypt/Sudan border, the highway of the river allowed movement between Egypt and Nubia, the people of the region leaving their marks on a narrow area of fertile land that fostered riverine animals like crocodiles, which are occasionally depicted in the rock engravings. From the 4th millennium BC, following several temperate millennia, savannah animals like giraffe lost their habitat in the increasingly arid environments to east and west, but remain reflected in the rock engravings of what is now desert.

        The range in styles and dates for Sudanese rock art emphasises its nature, not as a particular artistic style, but as personal and cultural manipulations of a specific medium. A number of stone percussive instruments known as rock gongs, which produce a sonorous tone when struck and are often apparently associated with cattle engravings, have stimulated discussion about the uses of rock art sites as multisensory ritual venues.

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 5'
      body: The understanding of much of Sudanese prehistory as it relates to rock
        art remains subject to debate. Some of the best-preserved and most varied
        rock art of Sudan’s desert regions is situated only metres from the Egyptian
        border in the far north-west corner of the country, in a valley of Jebel Uweinat
        – the enormous sandstone and granite outcrop which serves as a boundary between
        Egypt, Sudan and Libya. Numerous paintings and engravings are found here,
        including images of wild animals, such as giraffe and antelope, humans, dogs
        and many cattle. Some of these paintings have been compared with other styles
        of rock art in the wider Sahara, including the later Pastoral Period (Muzzolini,
        1995). Others have proposed that a different set of paintings in these sites
        may be older, with a stylistic link (although fragile) with the Round Head
        Period (Van Noten,1978). However, the scholarly community recognises the inherent
        difficulty of formulating conclusions of direct links with wider rock art
        practices. In areas around the Nile, where there are similar animal engravings,
        rock art is also from a wide range of time periods.

      body: 'Ascribing dates to rock art like that at Jebel Uweinat is also uncertain
        and is more difficult than dating images such as the depictions of Nile river
        boats or later Christian cross engravings like those found near the Third
        Cataract, where similar motifs are replicated on contemporary pottery and
        corroborated elsewhere in the archaeological record. Occasionally rock art
        may be found in a dateable stratigraphic context- a giraffe engraving at Gala
        Abu Ahmed in Wadi Howar, an ancient Nile tributary, was recently dated to
        before 1,200-1,300 BC in this way (Jesse, 2005). In general, other clues are
        necessary, for example known domestication dates: wild animal images are often
        superseded with depictions of animals like horses and camels. These were only
        widely known in northeast Africa from the second and first millennia BC respectively
        and are therefore unlikely to be older. However, this is not an exact science:
        examination of the superimpositions and levels of patination on some Nile
        valley cattle engravings show that they were made over thousands of years
        up to the not too distant past. Faced with such challenges, classifying rock
        art by design style, while problematic, can prove useful in envisioning chronology.'
