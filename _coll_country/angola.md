      body: 'Tchitundu-Hulu is the generic name for a group of four rock art sites
        located in the Namibe province on the south-west corner of Angola, by the
        edge of the Namib desert, about 120 km from the sea.  It is a semi-arid plain
        characterized by the presence of several inselbergs (isolated hills rising
        from the plain), the most important of which is Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume.  The
        group of rock art sites are surrounded by several seasonal rivers, within
        a maximum distance of 1 km.  Tchitundu-Hulu was first documented by José Camarate
        Andrade França in 1953, and since then it has become one of the most studied
        rock art sites in Angola, attracting the interest of renowned researchers
        such as  Abbé Breuil, J.  Desmond Clark and Santos Junior.  In 2014 one of
        the sites was the subject of a Masters dissertation (Caema 2014), the latest
        addition to the long term research on the site.  '

      body: 'The chronology of the Tchitundu-Hulu rock art is difficult to establish,
        and it is unclear if the four sites are of the same period at all.  Theories
        based on the lithic tools dispersed throughout the area ascribed the paintings
        to an ancient time period, possibly  tens of thousands of years old.  Radiocarbon
        samples coming from the excavation of Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume showed a date
        in the early 1st millennium BC, although the relation of the archaeological
        remains and the paintings has not been proved and archaeological materials
        of a more modern period were also located.  A sample taken from the pigments
        at the site rendered a date of the beginning of the first centuries of the
        1st millennium AD.  In any case, Tchitundu-Hulu hosts some of the oldest examples
        of rock art in the country, and it has been linked to the schematic traditions
        that characterize the rock art of Central Africa, more abundant in central
        Mozambique and Malawi.  '

      body: The question of who made the engravings or paintings is another complex
        issue for the interpretation of the Tchitundu-Hulu depictions.  The harsh
        conditions of this semi-desert area probably favoured a seasonal occupation
        of the region during the rainy season.  The location of Tchitundu-Hulu at
        the edge of the desert could also have made this place a strategic site for
        the communities living in the region.  Several local groups - Kwisi, Kuvale
        - have traditionally inhabited the area, but the authorship of these engravings
        and paintings and the motives for creating them remains obscure, as does the
        purpose and cultural context of the complex images of Tchitundu-Hulu.

      title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 1'
      body: |-
        Central Africa is dominated by vast river systems and lakes, particularly the Congo River Basin. Characterised by hot and wet weather on both sides of the equator, central Africa has no regular dry season, but aridity increases in intensity both north and south of the equator. Covered with a forest of about 400,000 m² (1,035,920 km²), it is one of the greenest parts of the continent.  The rock art of central Africa stretches from the Zambezi River to the Angolan Atlantic coast and reaches as far north as Cameroon and Uganda. Termed the ‘schematic rock art zone’ by Desmond Clark (1959), it is dominated by finger-painted geometric motifs and designs, thought to extend back many thousands of years.

        Eastern Africa, from the Zambezi River Valley to Lake Turkana, consists largely of a vast inland plateau with the highest elevations on the continent, such as Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m above sea level) and Mount Kenya (5,199 m above sea level). Twin parallel rift valleys run through the region, which includes the world’s second largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria. The climate is atypical of an equatorial region, being cool and dry due to the high altitude and monsoon winds created by the Ethiopian Highlands. The rock art of eastern Africa is concentrated on this plateau and consists mainly of paintings that include animal and human representations. Found mostly in central Tanzania, eastern Zambia and Malawi; in comparison to the widespread distribution of geometric rock art, this figurative tradition is much more localised, and found at just a few hundred sites in a region of less than 100km in diameter.

        The rock art of East Africa, in particular the red paintings from Tanzania, was extensively studied by Mary and Louis Leakey in the 1930s and 1950s. Eric Ten Raa observed Sandawe people of Tanzania making rock paintings in the mid-20th century, and on the basis of oral traditions argued that the rock art was made for three main purposes: casual art; magic art (for hunting purposes or connected to health and fertility) and sacrificial art (to appease ancestral spirits). Subsequently, during the 1970s Fidelis Masao and Emmanuel Anati recorded numerous sites, classifying the art in broad chronological and stylistic categories, proposing tentative interpretations with regard to meaning.

        There has much debate and uncertainty about Central African rock art.  The history of the region has seen much mobility and interaction of cultural groups and understanding how the rock art relates to particular groups has been problematic. Pioneering work in this region was undertaken by Margaret Metcalfe in central Malawi in the early 1920s, Clarence van Riet Lowe visited Zambia in 1936 and attempted to provide a chronological sequence and some insight into the meaning of the rock art. Since the 1950s (Clarke, 1959), archaeologists have attempted to situate rock art within broader archaeological frameworks in order to resolve chronologies, and to categorise the art with reference to style, colour, superimposition, subject matter, weathering, and positioning of depictions within the panel (Phillipson, 1976). Building on this work, our current understanding of rock in this region has been advanced by Benjamin Smith (1995, 1997, 2001) with his work in Zambia and Malawi.

      body: "Rock art of East Africa consists mainly of paintings, most of which are
        found in central Tanzania, and are fewer in number in eastern Zambia and Malawi;
        scholars have categorised them as follows:\n\n*__Red Paintings__*:  \nRed
        paintings can be sub-divided into those found in central Tanzania and those
        found stretching from Zambia to the Indian Ocean.\nTanzanian red paintings
        include large, naturalistic animals with occasional geometric motifs. The
        giraffe is the most frequently painted animal, but antelope, zebra, elephant,
        rhino, felines and ostrich are also depicted. Later images show figures with
        highly distinctive stylised human head forms or hairstyles and body decoration,
        sometimes in apparent hunting and domestic scenes. The Sandawe and Hadza,
        hunter-gatherer groups, indigenous to north-central and central Tanzania respectively,
        claim their ancestors were responsible for some of the later art.\n\nThe area
        in which Sandawe rock art is found is less than 100km in diameter and occurs
        at just a few hundred sites, but corresponds closely to the known distribution
        of this group. There have been some suggestions that Sandawe were making rock
        art early into the 20th century, linking the art to particular rituals, in
        particular simbo; a trance dance in which the Sandawe communicate with the
        spirit world by taking on the power of an animal. The art displays a range
        of motifs and postures, features that can be understood by reference to simbo
        and to trance experiences; such as groups of human figures bending at the
        waist (which occurs during the *simbo* dance), taking on animal features such
        as ears and tails, and floating or flying; reflecting the experiences of those
        possessed in the dance."

      body: "Zambian rock art does not share any similarities with Tanzanian rock
        art and can be divided into two categories; animals (with a few depictions
        of humans), and geometric motifs. Animals are often highly stylised and superimposed
        with rows of dots. Geometric designs include, circles, some of which have
        radiating lines, concentric circles, parallel lines and ladder shapes. Predominantly
        painted in red, the remains of white pigment is still often visible. David
        Phillipson (1976) proposed that the naturalistic animals were earlier in date
        than geometric designs. Building on Phillipson’s work, Benjamin Smith studied
        ethnographic records and demonstrated that geometric motifs were made by women
        or controlling the weather.\n\n*__Pastoralist paintings__*: \nPastoralist
        paintings are rare, with only a few known sites in Kenya and other possible
        sites in Malawi. Usually painted in black, white and grey, but also in other
        colours, they include small outlines, often infilled, of cattle and are occasional
        accompanied by geometric motifs. Made during the period from 3,200 to 1,800
        years ago the practice ceased after Bantu language speaking people had settled
        in eastern Africa. Similar paintings are found in Ethiopia but not in southern
        Africa, and it has been assumed that these were made by Cushitic or Nilotic
        speaking groups, but their precise attribution remains unclear (Smith, 2013:154).\n"

        *__Late White Paintings__*:
        Commonly painted in white, or off-white with the fingers, so-called ‘Late White’ depictions include quite large crudely rendered representations of wild animals, mythical animals, human figures and numerous geometric motifs. These paintings are attributed to Bantu language speaking, iron-working farmers who entered eastern Africa about 2,000 years ago from the west on the border of Nigeria and Cameroon. Moving through areas occupied by the Batwa it is thought they learned the use of symbols painted on rock, skin, bark cloth and in sand. Chewa peoples, Bantu language speakers who live in modern day Zambia and Malawi claim their ancestors made many of the more recent paintings which they used in rites of passage ceremonies.

        *__Meat-feasting paintings__*:
        Meat-feasting shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle. The term Maa relates to a group of closely related Eastern Nilotic languages, which historically dominated the east African hinterland; and today is spoken by around a million people. During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners, but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease. Different symbols may be used for male and female animals. Over the centuries, because the depictions are on the ceiling of meat feasting rock shelters, and because sites are used even today, a build-up of soot has obscured or obliterated the paintings. Unfortunately, few have been recorded or mapped.

      title: 'Categories: CENTRAL AFRICA'
      title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 7'
      body: The rock art of central Africa is attributed to hunter-gatherers known
        as Batwa. This term is used widely in eastern central and southern Africa
        to denote any autochthonous hunter-gatherer people. The rock art of the Batwa
        can be divided into two categories which are quite distinctive stylistically
        from the Tanzanian depictions of the Sandawe and Hadza. Nearly 3,000 sites
        are currently known from within this area. The vast majority, around 90%,
        consist of finger-painted geometric designs; the remaining 10% include highly
        stylised animal forms (with a few human figures) and rows of finger dots.
        Both types are thought to date back many thousands of years. The two traditions
        co-occur over a vast area of eastern and central Africa and while often found
        in close proximity to each other are only found together at a few sites. However,
        it is the dominance of geometric motifs that make this rock art tradition
        very distinctive from other regions in Africa.

      title: Rock art in the Horn of Africa
      title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 10'
      body: "The Horn of Africa has historically been a crossroads area between the
        Eastern Sahara, the Subtropical regions to the South and the Arabic Peninsula.
        These mixed influences can be seen in many archaeological and historical features
        throughout the region, the rock art being no exception. Since the early stages
        of research in the 1930s, a strong relationship between the rock art in Ethiopia
        and the Arabian Peninsula was detected, leading to the establishment of the
        term *Ethiopian-Arabian* rock art by Pavel Červiček in 1971. This research
        thread proposes a progressive evolution from naturalism to schematism, ranging
        from the 4th-3rd millennium BC to the near past. Although the *Ethiopian-Arabian*
        proposal is still widely accepted and stylistic similarities between the rock
        art of Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen or Saudi Arabia are undeniable, recent voices
        have been raised against the term because of its excessive generalisation
        and lack of operability. In addition, recent research to the south of Ethiopia
        have started to discover new rock art sites related to those found in Uganda
        and Kenya.\n\nRegarding the main themes of the Horn of Africa rock art, cattle
        depictions seem to have been paramount, with cows and bulls depicted either
        isolated or in herds, frequently associated with ritual scenes which show
        their importance in these communities. Other animals – zebus, camels, felines,
        dogs, etc. –  are also represented, as well as rows of human figures, and
        fighting scenes between warriors or against lions. Geometric symbols are also
        common, usually associated with other depictions; and in some places they
        have been interpreted as tribal or clan marks. Both engraving and painting
        is common in most regions, with many regional variations. \n"

        Rock art in the Horn of Africa faces several challenges. One of them is the lack of consolidated chronologies and absolute dating for the paintings and engravings. Another is the uneven knowledge of rock art throughout the region, with research often affected by political unrest. Therefore, distributions of rock art in the region are steadily growing as research is undertaken in one of the most interactive areas in East Africa.

        The rock art of Central and East Africa is one of the least documented and well understood of the corpus of African rock art. However, in recent years scholars have undertaken some comprehensive reviews of existing sites and surveys of new sites to open up the debates and more fully understand the complexities of this region.

      title_internal: 'Geometric motifs: thematic, chapter 1'
      body: |-
        The rock art of eastern Africa is characterised by a wide range of non-figurative images, broadly defined as geometric. Occurring in a number of different patterns or designs, they are thought to have been in existence in this region for thousands of years, although often it is difficult to attribute the art to particular cultural groups. Geometric rock art is difficult to interpret, and designs have been variously associated with sympathetic magic, symbols of climate or fertility and altered states of consciousness (Coulson and Campbell, 2010:220). However, in some cases the motifs painted or engraved on the rock face resemble the same designs used for branding livestock and are intimately related to people’s lives and world views in this region.

        First observed in Kenya in the 1970s with the work of Gramly (1975) at Lukenya Hill and Lynch and Robbins (1977) at Namoratung’a, some geometric motifs seen in the rock art of the region were observed to have had their counterparts on the hides of cattle of local communities. Although cattle branding is known to be  practised by several Kenyan groups, Gramly concluded that  “drawing cattle brands on the walls of rock shelters appears to be confined to the regions formerly inhabited by the Maa-speaking pastoralists or presently occupied by them”&dagger;(Gramly, 1977:117).

      body: In the case of Lukenya Hill, the rock shelters on whose walls these geometric
        symbols occur are associated with meat-feasting ceremonies. Meat-feasting
        shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are
        places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat
        in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle.
        During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were
        painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand
        their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners,
        but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease.
        Different symbols may be used for male and female animals.

      body: The sites of Namoratung’a near Lake Turkana in northern Kenya showed a
        similar visible relationship. The southernmost site is well known for its
        167 megalithic stones marking male burials on which are engraved hundreds
        of geometric motifs. Some of these motifs bear a striking resemblance to the
        brand marks that the Turkana mark on their cattle, camels, donkeys and other
        livestock in the area, although local people claim no authorship for the funerary
        engravings (Russell, 2013:4).

      title_internal: 'Geometric motifs: thematic, chapter 4'
      body: Recent research (Russell, 2013) has shown that at Namoratung’a the branding
        of animals signifies a sense of belonging rather than a mark of ownership
        as we understand it in a modern farming context; all livestock, cattle, camel,
        goats, sheep and donkeys are branded according to species and sex (Russell,
        2013:7). Ethnographic accounts document that clan membership can only be determined
        by observing someone with their livestock (Russell, 2013:9). The symbol itself
        is not as important as the act of placing it on the animal’s skin, and local
        people have confirmed that they never mark rock with brand marks. Thus, the
        geometric motifs on the grave markers may have been borrowed by local Turkana
        to serve as identity markers, but in a different context. In the Horn of Africa,
        some geometric rock art is located in the open landscape and on graves. It
        has been suggested that these too are brand or clan marks, possibly made by
        camel keeping pastoralists to mark achievement, territory or ownership (Russell,
        2013:18). Some nomadic pastoralists, further afield, such as the Tuareg, place
        their clan marks along the routes they travel, carved onto salt blocks, trees
        and wells (Mohamed, 1990; Landais, 2001).

      body: "However, not all pastoralist geometric motifs can be associated with
        meat-feasting or livestock branding; they may have wider symbolism or be symbolic
        of something else (Russell, 2013:17).  For example, informants from the Samburu
        people reported that while some of the painted motifs found at Samburu meat-feasting
        shelters were of cattle brands, others represented female headdresses or were
        made to mark an initiation, and in some Masai shelters there are also clear
        representations of warriors’ shields.  In Uganda, a ceremonial rock in Karamoja,
        shows a dung painting consisting of large circles bisected by a cross which
        is said to represent cattle enclosures (Robbins, 1972). Geometric symbols,
        painted in fat and red ochre, on large phallic-shaped fertility stones on
        the Mesakin and Korongo Hills in south Sudan indicate the sex of the child
        to whom prayers are offered (Bell, 1936). A circle bisected by a line or circles
        bisected by two crosses represent boys. Girls are represented by a cross (drawn
        diagonally) or a slanting line (like a forward slash)(Russell, 2013: 17).\n\nAlthough
        pastoralist geometric motifs are widespread in the rock art of eastern Africa,
        attempting to find the meaning behind geometric designs is problematic. The
        examples discussed here demonstrate that motifs can have multiple authors,
        even in the same location, and that identical symbols can be the products
        of very different behaviours. \n"

      title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 2'
      body: Angola has a variety of climates.  The flat coastal plain ranges between
        25 and 150 km in width, and is a semiarid region covered by scrub, turning
        into sand dunes to the south, near Namibia.  The coastal region abruptly gives
        way to a series of mountains and escarpments divided  by the Cuanza River.  The
        northern part has an average height of 500 m, but the southern region is far
        higher, with the peaks occasionally exceeding 2,300 m.  This mountainous region
        is in fact a transitional area between the coastal plain and the great central
        plateau of Africa.  This plateau dominates Angola’s geography with an altitude
        from 1,200 to 1,800 m, and consists of a region of plains and low hills with
        a tropical climate.  The climate becomes drier to the south and wetter to
        the north, where a wide region of the country can be defined as rainforest.

        then, research was intermittent until the 1950s, when the important site of
        Tchitundu-Hulu was studied and published.  The relevance of Tchitundu-Hulu
        attracted the attention of important scholars such as Desmond Clark and the  Abbé
        Breuil, who along with Portuguese researchers contextualized Angolan rock
        art within the continent.  Research increased significantly over the next
        two decades, but during the 1980s political instability gave way to a period
        of stagnation until the 1990s, when new researchers began comprehensive surveys

        on the region and the chronology.  The oldest images are painted or engraved
        geometric symbols and anthropomorphic figures.  More recent depictions include
        axes, spears and firearms.  The latest period of the Angolan rock art includes
        complex scenes of war and hunting, and in a number of cases human figures
        are carried on a palanquin-like structure.  Although schematic figures are
        widespread throughout the country, they are predominant in the south-west
        where most of the sites have been compared to those in the Central Africa
        Schematic Art zone, with parallels in Malawi and Mozambique.  In the west-central
        area of Angola, in addition to the schematic symbols and animals, images of
        men holding weapons, fighting and hunting are common, including warriors holding
        firearms which make reference to the first contact with Europeans by the 16th
        century.  Near the north-west coast, some of the paintings and engravings
        have been related to objects used in religious ceremonies – wooden statuettes
        or decorated pot lids.  In particular, a close association has been established
        between rock art depictions and the so-called Cabinda pot lids, which have
        different carved symbols—animals, objects, human figures—acting as a shared

      title: " Chronology"
      title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 6'
      body: 'As is so often the case with rock art, the dating of images is complex
        due to the absence of direct correlations between rock art depictions and
        well contextualised archaeological remains.  Some of the sites with rock art
        have been excavated showing dates of the 7th millennium BC, but the relationship
        with the rock art is unclear.  In the Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume site, the excavation
        at the cave provided a 1st millennium BC date, and the only radiocarbon date
        taken from the pigments at this site provided a date of the 1st century AD,
        which corresponds with other dates of the same style in Central Africa.  The
        second tool for assigning a chronology is the analysis of the subject matter
        represented in the rock art depictions: the presence of metal objects, for
        example, would imply a date of the 1st millennium AD onwards, when this material
        was introduced.  Whereas, depictions featuring images of firearms would date
        from the 16th century onwards.  The end of the rock art tradition has been
        associated with the presence of Europeans but was probably progressive as
        the control of the region by the Portuguese grew during the 17th and 18th
        centuries.  '
