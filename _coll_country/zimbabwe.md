        to the south-west of Zimbabwe, in Matabeleland, one of the two main rock art
        regions in the country. It is a large region, more than 2000 sq. km, characterized
        by granite hills separated by nearly parallel valleys where the vegetation
        consists of scattered woodlands and areas covered by grass with an abundance
        of wild fruits. The region was occupied since at least the Middle Stone Age,
        but the human presence increased in the last millennia BC. The region holds
        an incredible amount of rock art; as many as 3,000 sites have been estimated
        based on the better surveyed areas. Paintings constitute the vast majority
        of depictions, although occasional engravings have also been reported. Paintings
        are usually found in rock shelters and associated with archaeological remains,
        which show an occupation of the area since the Early Stone Age. '

        Zimbabwe, mainly consisting of depictions of animals and human figures often
        grouped in complex scenes, clustered or represented in rows. Human figures
        are predominant, with males being more numerous than women and children very
        rare. They are usually depicted in a slender style, facing left or right but
        with the upper part of the body facing front, and often carrying bows, arrows
        or other objects. Regarding the animals, mammals dominate, with the kudu antelope
        being especially numerous although this animal is not commonly found in the
        Matobo Hills. A wide range of animals such as smaller antelopes, giraffes,
        zebras, ostriches, monkeys, eland antelope, rhinoceros and to a lesser extent
        carnivores are also depicted. The animals are represented in very different
        attitudes and may be depicted standing still, running or lying. Humans and
        animals are often related in hunting scenes. Along with animals and human
        figures, a fair number of geometric symbols are present, including a very
        characteristic type of motif made of a series of narrow oval-like shapes (formlings)
        usually depicted vertically, and sometimes interpreted as beehives. '

      body: "Many of the depictions in the Matobo Hills are associated with hunter-gatherers,
        providing a great amount of information about the social, economic and spiritual
        life of these groups. Depictions of daily objects (bows, vessels, digging
        sticks, cloaks) appear depicted in the rock art, and humans are shown hunting
        animals, fighting other groups and dancing in what seem to be ritual scenes.
        In fact, many of the scenes show strong similarities to those found in the
        Drakensberg (South Africa), and part of the iconography in the Zimbabwean
        paintings – ‘therianthropes’ (part-human, part-animal figures), elongated
        figures, rain animals, geometric figures – can be easily related to trance
        or rain-making activities similar to those seen in South Africa. These paintings
        have been interpreted as representing the trance experiences of shamans (the
        term ‘shaman’ is derived from Siberian concepts of Shamanism and its applicability
        to San&#124;Bushman¹ cultures has been questioned, but it is utilised here
        on the understanding that it sufficiently represents trancers in this academic
        context, where it is the most frequently used term to describe them). However,
        unlike in South Africa, the Matobo Hills rock art is not recent and researchers
        lack the key ethnographic records that help us to interpret the paintings.
        Therefore, interpretations cannot be directly extrapolated from the South
        African paintings to those of the Matobo Hills, and researchers such as Peter
        Garlake have broadened the interpretative framework of this art to include
        social issues in addition to the religious. \n\n"

        hunter gatherers, though. Although fewer, there are some paintings that correspond
        to a later period which were made by Iron Age farmers. Unlike in South Africa,
        rock art does not show evidence of interaction between these two groups, and
        it is probable that the hunter-gatherers that inhabited the area were either
        displaced or absorbed by these new farmer communities. However, some of the
        later paintings show some links with the previous hunter-gatherers traditions.
        This later art consists mainly of schematic figures (usually animals, including
        domestic ones such as goats and cows) and geometric symbols, mostly depicted
        in white but also red or black and smeared with the hand or the fingers. '

      body: |+
        The southern African countries of Zimbabwe, South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, Botswana and Namibia contain thousands of rock art sites and southern African rock art has been studied extensively.  Due to perceived similarities in subject matter, even across great distances, much southern African rock art has been ascribed to hunter-gatherer painters and engravers who appear to have had a shared set of cultural references.  These have been linked with beliefs and practices which remain common to modern San&#124;Bushman¹ people, a number of traditional hunter-gatherer groups who continue to live in Southern Africa, principally in Namibia, Botswana and South Africa.  There are, however, differences in style and technique between regions, and various rock art traditions are attributed to other cultural groups and their ancestors.  As is often the case with rock art, the accurate attribution of authorship, date and motivation is difficult to establish, but the rock art of this region continues to be studied and the richness of the material in terms of subject matter, as well as in the context of the archaeological record, has much to tell us, both about its own provenance and the lives of the people who produced it.

        Namibia, with the climate tending to become drier towards the south and west.  The
        central southern African plateau is divided by the central dip of the Kalahari
        basin, and bordered by the Great Escarpment, a sharp drop in altitude towards
        the coast which forms a ridge framing much of southern Africa.  The escarpment
        runs in a rough inland parallel to the coastline, from northern Angola, south
        around the Cape and up in the east to the border between Zimbabwe and Malawi.  Both
        painted and engraved rock art is found throughout southern Africa, with the
        type and distribution partially informed by the geographical characteristics
        of the different regions.  Inland areas with exposed boulders, flat rock ‘pavements’
        and rocky outcrops tend to feature engraved rock art, whereas paintings are
        more commonly found in the protective rock shelters of mountainous or hilly
        areas, often in ranges edging the Great Escarpment.  '

      title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 4'
      body: "Rock art of the type associated with hunter-gatherers is perhaps the
        most widely distributed rock art tradition in southern Africa, with numerous
        known examples in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe, but also with examples
        found in Botswana and Mozambique. This tradition comprises paintings and engravings,
        with both techniques featuring images of animals and people.  The type and
        composition varies from region to region.  For example, rock art sites of
        the southern Drakensberg and Maloti mountains in South Africa and Lesotho
        contain a higher proportion of images of eland antelope, while those in Namibia
        in turn feature more giraffes.  There are also regional variations in style
        and colour: in some sites and areas paintings are polychrome (multi-coloured)
        while in others they are not.\n\nDifferences also occur in composition between
        painting and engraving sites, with paintings more likely to feature multiple
        images on a single surface, often interacting with one another, while engraving
        sites more often include isolated images on individual rocks and boulders.
        \ However, there are commonalities in both imagery and style, with paintings
        throughout southern Africa often including depictions of people, particularly
        in procession and carrying items such as bows and arrows.  Also heavily featured
        in both paintings and engravings are animals, in particular large ungulates
        which are often naturalistically depicted, sometimes in great detail.  Additionally,
        images may include people and animals which appear to have the features of
        several species and are harder to identify.  Some hunter-gatherer type paintings
        are described as ‘fine-line’ paintings because of the delicacy of their rendering
        with a thin brush.  \n"

      body: "Hunter-gatherer rock paintings are found in particular concentrations
        in the Drakensberg-Maloti and Cape Fold Mountains in South Africa and Lesotho,
        the Brandberg and Erongo Mountains in Namibia and the Matobo Hills in Zimbabwe,
        while engraving sites are found throughout the interior, often near water
        courses. \n\nA different form of rock painting from the hunter-gatherer type,
        found mainly in the north-eastern portion of southern Africa is that of the
        ‘late whites’.  Paintings in this tradition are so-called because they are
        usually associated with Bantu language-speaking Iron Age farming communities
        who entered the area from the north from around 2,000 years ago and many of
        these images are thought to have been painted later than some of the older
        hunter-gatherer paintings. ‘Late white’ paintings take many forms, but have
        generally been applied with a finger rather than a brush, and as the name
        suggests, are largely white in colour.  These images represent animals, people
        and geometric shapes, often in quite schematic forms, in contrast to the generally
        more naturalistic depictions of the hunter-gatherer art.  \n\nSometimes ‘late
        white’ art images relate to dateable events or depict objects and scenes which
        could only have taken place following European settlement, such as trains.
        \ Other forms of southern African rock art also depict European people and
        objects.  These include images from the Western Cape in South Africa of a
        sailing ship, estimated to date from after the mid-17th century, as well as
        painted and engraved imagery from throughout South Africa showing people on
        horseback with firearms. Such images are sometimes termed ‘contact art’ as
        their subject matter demonstrates that they follow the period of first contact
        between European and indigenous people.   \n"

      body: 'The first known reports of African rock art outside of the continent
        appear to come from the Bishop of Mozambique, who in 1721 reported sightings
        of paintings on rocks to the Royal Academy of History in Lisbon. Following
        this, reports, copies and publications of rock art from throughout modern
        South Africa were made with increasing frequency by officials and explorers.
        From the mid-19th century onwards, rock art from present-day Namibia, Zimbabwe
        and Botswana began to be documented, and during the first few decades of the
        twentieth century global public interest in the art was piqued by a series
        of illustrated publications. The hunter-gatherer rock art in particular had
        a strong aesthetic and academic appeal to western audiences, and reports,
        photographs and copied images attracted the attention of prominent figures
        in archaeology and ethnology such as Miles Burkitt, Leo Frobenius and the
        Abbé Breuil, researchers whose interest in rock art worldwide let them to
        visit and write about southern African rock art sites.  A further intensification
        of archaeological and anthropological research and recording in the 1950s-70s,
        resulted in new insights into the interpretations and attributions for southern
        African rock art. Rock art research continues throughout the area today.  '

      title: Interpretation
      title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 8'
      body: Rather than showing scenes from daily life, as was once assumed, it is
        now usually accepted that hunter-gatherer art in southern Africa shows images
        and motifs of spiritual and cultural importance. In particular, it is thought
        that some images reflect trance visions of San&#124;Bushman spiritual leaders,
        or shamans,  during which they are considered to enter the world of spirits,
        where they are held to perform tasks for themselves and their communities,
        such as healing the sick or encouraging rain. This interpretation, which has
        been widely accepted, explains certain features of the art, for example the
        predominance of certain animals like eland antelope (due to their special
        cultural significance) and themes such as dot patterns and zigzag lines (interpreted
        as geometric patterns that shamans may see upon entering a trance state).

      title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 9'
      body: "The rock art attributed to ancestral San&#124;Bushman hunter-gatherers
        has many varied motifs, some of which may also relate to specific themes such
        as initiation or rainmaking (indeed within its cultural context one image
        may have several significances).  San&#124;Bushman informants in the 19th
        century told researchers that certain ambiguously shaped animals in the rock
        art repertoire represented animals related to water.  Images such as these
        are known to researchers as 'rain animals' and it has been suggested that
        certain images could reflect—or prompt—the shaman's attempt to control rainfall.
        Some 'late white' art has also been proposed to have associations with rainmaking
        practices, and indeed the proximity of some geometric rock art images, proposed
        to be of possible Khoekhoen origin, to watercourses appears to emphasise the
        practical and spiritual significance of water among historical southern African
        communities. It has also been proposed that some forms of geometric art attributed
        to Khoekhoen people may be linked by tradition and motif to the schematic
        art traditions of central Africa, themselves attributed to hunter-gatherers
        and possibly made in connection with beliefs about water and fertility.  Much
        in the “late white” corpus of paintings appears to be connected to initiation
        practices, part of a larger set of connected traditions extending north as
        far as Kenya.   \n\nThe long time periods, cultural connections, and movements
        involved can make attribution difficult.  For example, the idiosyncratic rock
        paintings of Tsodilo Hills in Botswana which appear to have similarities with
        the hunter-gatherer style include images of domesticates and may have been
        the work of herders.  More localised traditions, such as that of engravings
        in north-western South Africa representing the homesteads of ancestral Nguni
        or Sotho-Tswana language speakers, or the focus on engravings of animal tracks
        found in Namibia, demonstrate more specific regional significances.  Research
        continues and in recent decades, researchers, focusing on studying individual
        sites and sets of sites within the landscape and the local historical context,
        have discussed how their placement and subject matter may reflect the shifting
        balances of power, and changes in their communities over time.  \n"

      title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 10'
      body: "Although dating rock art is always difficult, the study of rock art sites
        from southern Africa has benefitted from archaeological study and excavations
        at rock art sites have sometimes revealed useful information for ascribing
        dates.  Some of the oldest reliably dated examples of rock art in the world
        have been found in the region, with the most well-known examples probably
        being the painted plaques from Apollo 11 Cave in Namibia, dated to around
        30,000 years ago.  A portion of an engraved animal found in South Africa’s
        Northern Cape is estimated to be 10,200 years old and painted spalls from
        shelter walls in Zimbabwe have been dated to 12,000 years ago or older.  However,
        it is thought that the majority of existing rock art was made more recently.
        \ As ever, subject matter is also helpful in ascribing maximum date ranges.
        \ We know, for example,that images of domestic animals are probably less than
        2,000 years old.  The condition of the art may also help to establish relative
        ages, particularly with regards to engravings, which may be in some cases
        be categorised by the discolouration of the patina that darkens them over
        time.   \n\nThe multiplicity of rock art sites throughout southern Africa
        form a major component of southern Africa’s archaeological record, with many
        interesting clues about the lives of past inhabitants and, in some cases,
        continuing religious and cultural importance for contemporary communities.
        \ Many sites are open to the public, affording visitors the unique experience
        of viewing rock art in situ.  Unfortunately, the exposed nature of rock art
        in the field leaves it open to potential damage from the environment and vandalism.
        \ Many  major rock art sites in southern Africa are protected by law in their
        respective countries and the Maloti-Drakensberg Park in South Africa and Lesotho,
        Twyfelfontein/ǀUi-ǁAis in Namibia, Tsodilo Hills in Botswana and the Matobo
        Hills in Zimbabwe are all inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. \n"

        and Limpopo river systems, with a tropical climate moderated by altitude.
        The highest part of the country is the eastern Highlands; a north-south mountain
        range reaching altitudes of 2,500 m. Rock art is located in two main areas,
        the northern region of Mashonaland and the south-western area of Matabeleland.
        These areas are full of granite hills and boulders that provide excellent
        shelters for the paintings. The Matobo hills in Matabeleland constitute one
        of the most outstanding examples of rock art in Southern Africa. The total
        number of Zimbabwean rock art sites is unknown, but estimations made point
        to thousands of sites throughout the country, with more being discovered annually. '

      body: 'Zimbabwean rock art was first reported by Europeans in 1927, when Miles
        Burkitt visited southern Africa, but is especially linked to Leo Frobenius,
        one of the most renowned researchers in the first decades of the 20th century.
        Leo Frobenius travelled to the region in 1928 with a German team and thoroughly
        documented numerous paintings, identifying many of the most characteristic
        features of Zimbabwean rock art. However, he failed in identifying the authors
        of the paintings, ascribing them to external influences of “high civilizations”
        instead to the local communities who made them. Subsequently, work was continued
        by Elizabeth Mannsfeld-Goodall, who for forty years documented rock art paintings
        constituting a huge corpus of tracings, but without developing an interpretative
        framework for them. In the 1950s, another historic researcher, the Abbé Henri
        Breuil, visited Zimbabwe and studied the paintings, again suggesting an Egyptian
        or Minoan origin. It wasn’t until the 1960s and 1970s when a more objective
        approach to the study of rock art started, with Peter Garlake the most prominent
        figure in research from the 1980s onwards. Garlake wrote the first comprehensive
        books on Zimbabwean rock art (Garlake 1987), integrating it within the general
        framework of southern Africa and raising awareness about the importance of
        these archaeological expressions. In 2003 the Matobo Hills were included in
        the World Heritage List acknowledging the relevance of Zimbabwean rock art
        for African heritage. '

      body: The rock art of Zimbabwe is some of the richest in Africa both in variety
        and complexity, the vast majority being painted figures infilled or outlined
        usually with just one colour, although bichrome examples are also known. The
        human figure is the most often represented engaged in different activities
        -hunting, walking, dancing- either isolated or in groups of up to forty people.
        The figures are depicted in different styles, from the very schematic to relatively
        naturalistic outlines, with men far more represented than women, and usually
        depicted carrying bows and arrows. In some cases, these figures are part of
        very complex scenes including animals and geometric symbols, some of which
        have been interpreted as trance-like scenes similar to those in South Africa
        with figures bleeding from their noses, crouching or dancing in groups or
        sharing animal traits. A very specific type of depiction is human figures
        with hugely distended abdomens, a trait that is associated either with fertility
        or mystic potency concepts.

      body: 'Along with human figures, animals are widely represented in Zimbabwean
        rock art, with kudu depictions dominating, but also with zebra, tsessebe and
        sable antelopes commonly represented. Surprisingly, other antelopes such as
        eland, waterbucks or wildebeest are very rarely represented, while other animals
        (lions, cheetah, birds, ant bears, porcupines, baboons or warthogs) are very
        scarce. Fish and crocodiles are relatively common, the latter represented
        as if seen from above or below. There seems to be a preference for the depiction
        of females rather than males, especially in the case of antelopes or elephants.
        Regardless of the type of animal, the depictions seem to have a deep symbolism
        far beyond the representation of animals just hunted and consumed, often being
        surrounded by dots, flecks or networks of lines. That symbolism is especially
        important in the case of the elephant, which is often depicted being hunted
        by groups of men. '

        Traditionally, the themes expressed in Zimbabwean rock art have been identified as the same as those of the San&#124;Bushmen¹ from South Africa and in many cases are undoubtedly related, and provide key hints for their interpretation. However, there are also differences, such as the emphasis given to different animals, the higher presence of trees and plants in Zimbabwe or the smaller presence of trance scenes in the north compared to that of the Drakensberg. Moreover, the lack of ethnographic information for Zimbabwean paintings and their older chronology make it difficult to establish the same type of associations as those made for other areas with more direct connections rock art to known cultures, as happens in South Africa. Although in a minority, rock art of a later chronology can be attributed to Iron Age farmers, characterized by more schematic figures, usually white and painted thickly with the finger or the hand. As is the case in other areas in Central Africa, some of these later depictions are related to rain making and initiation ceremonies.

        ¹ San&#124;Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

      body: "As with much rock art, the dating of Zimbabwe paintings is a challenging
        subject, although there is a consensus about them being significantly older
        than those of the Drakensberg and probably dated at before 2,000 years ago.
        The lack of any type of agriculture-related images in the paintings, which
        was established by the 1st millennium AD, sets a relative dating for the depictions,
        while the scarcity of sheep (introduced by the second half of the first millennium
        BC in the area) points to a time period in which these animals were still
        uncommon. These hints and the fact that, unlike in other areas there are not
        historical subjects represented in the paintings, seems to indicate that Zimbabwean
        paintings are at least 1,000 years old. However, archaeological evidence (Walker
        2012: 44) suggests that rock art could be significantly older than that, at
        least several thousands of years old. \n\n"
