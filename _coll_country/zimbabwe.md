        to the south-west of Zimbabwe, in Matabeleland, one of the two main rock art
        regions in the country. It is a large region, more than 2000 sq. km, characterized
        by granite hills separated by nearly parallel valleys where the vegetation
        consists of scattered woodlands and areas covered by grass with an abundance
        of wild fruits. The region was occupied since at least the Middle Stone Age,
        but the human presence increased in the last millennia BC. The region holds
        an incredible amount of rock art; as many as 3,000 sites have been estimated
        based on the better surveyed areas. Paintings constitute the vast majority
        of depictions, although occasional engravings have also been reported. Paintings
        are usually found in rock shelters and associated with archaeological remains,
        which show an occupation of the area since the Early Stone Age. '

        Zimbabwe, mainly consisting of depictions of animals and human figures often
        grouped in complex scenes, clustered or represented in rows. Human figures
        are predominant, with males being more numerous than women and children very
        rare. They are usually depicted in a slender style, facing left or right but
        with the upper part of the body facing front, and often carrying bows, arrows
        or other objects. Regarding the animals, mammals dominate, with the kudu antelope
        being especially numerous although this animal is not commonly found in the
        Matobo Hills. A wide range of animals such as smaller antelopes, giraffes,
        zebras, ostriches, monkeys, eland antelope, rhinoceros and to a lesser extent
        carnivores are also depicted. The animals are represented in very different
        attitudes and may be depicted standing still, running or lying. Humans and
        animals are often related in hunting scenes. Along with animals and human
        figures, a fair number of geometric symbols are present, including a very
        characteristic type of motif made of a series of narrow oval-like shapes (formlings)
        usually depicted vertically, and sometimes interpreted as beehives. '

      body: "Many of the depictions in the Matobo Hills are associated with hunter-gatherers,
        providing a great amount of information about the social, economic and spiritual
        life of these groups. Depictions of daily objects (bows, vessels, digging
        sticks, cloaks) appear depicted in the rock art, and humans are shown hunting
        animals, fighting other groups and dancing in what seem to be ritual scenes.
        In fact, many of the scenes show strong similarities to those found in the
        Drakensberg (South Africa), and part of the iconography in the Zimbabwean
        paintings – ‘therianthropes’ (part-human, part-animal figures), elongated
        figures, rain animals, geometric figures – can be easily related to trance
        or rain-making activities similar to those seen in South Africa. These paintings
        have been interpreted as representing the trance experiences of shamans (the
        term ‘shaman’ is derived from Siberian concepts of Shamanism and its applicability
        to San\\|Bushman¹ cultures has been questioned, but it is utilised here on
        the understanding that it sufficiently represents trancers in this academic
        context, where it is the most frequently used term to describe them). However,
        unlike in South Africa, the Matobo Hills rock art is not recent and researchers
        lack the key ethnographic records that help us to interpret the paintings.
        Therefore, interpretations cannot be directly extrapolated from the South
        African paintings to those of the Matobo Hills, and researchers such as Peter
        Garlake have broadened the interpretative framework of this art to include
        social issues in addition to the religious. \n\n"

        hunter gatherers, though. Although fewer, there are some paintings that correspond
        to a later period which were made by Iron Age farmers. Unlike in South Africa,
        rock art does not show evidence of interaction between these two groups, and
        it is probable that the hunter-gatherers that inhabited the area were either
        displaced or absorbed by these new farmer communities. However, some of the
        later paintings show some links with the previous hunter-gatherers traditions.
        This later art consists mainly of schematic figures (usually animals, including
        domestic ones such as goats and cows) and geometric symbols, mostly depicted
        in white but also red or black and smeared with the hand or the fingers. '

      body: 'Zimbabwe is a landlocked country surrounded by Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana
        and South Africa, occupying a large, granitic high plateau between the Zambezi
        and Limpopo river systems, with a tropical climate moderated by altitude.
        The highest part of the country is the eastern Highlands; a north-south mountain
        range reaching altitudes of 2,500 m. Rock art is located in two main areas,
        the northern region of Mashonaland and the south-western area of Matabeleland.
        These areas are full of granite hills and boulders that provide excellent
        shelters for the paintings. The Matobo hills in Matabeleland constitute one
        of the most outstanding examples of rock art in Southern Africa. The total
        number of Zimbabwean rock art sites is unknown, but estimations made point
        to thousands of sites throughout the country, with more being discovered annually. '

      title: History of the research
      title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 2'
      body: 'Zimbabwean rock art was first reported by Europeans in 1927, when Miles
        Burkitt visited southern Africa, but is especially linked to Leo Frobenius,
        one of the most renowned researchers in the first decades of the 20th century.
        Leo Frobenius travelled to the region in 1928 with a German team and thoroughly
        documented numerous paintings, identifying many of the most characteristic
        features of Zimbabwean rock art. However, he failed in identifying the authors
        of the paintings, ascribing them to external influences of “high civilizations”
        instead to the local communities who made them. Subsequently, work was continued
        by Elizabeth Mannsfeld-Goodall, who for forty years documented rock art paintings
        constituting a huge corpus of tracings, but without developing an interpretative
        framework for them. In the 1950s, another historic researcher, the Abbé Henri
        Breuil, visited Zimbabwe and studied the paintings, again suggesting an Egyptian
        or Minoan origin. It wasn’t until the 1960s and 1970s when a more objective
        approach to the study of rock art started, with Peter Garlake the most prominent
        figure in research from the 1980s onwards. Garlake wrote the first comprehensive
        books on Zimbabwean rock art (Garlake 1987), integrating it within the general
        framework of southern Africa and raising awareness about the importance of
        these archaeological expressions. In 2003 the Matobo Hills were included in
        the World Heritage List acknowledging the relevance of Zimbabwean rock art
        for African heritage. '

      title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 3'
      body: The rock art of Zimbabwe is some of the richest in Africa both in variety
        and complexity, the vast majority being painted figures infilled or outlined
        usually with just one colour, although bichrome examples are also known. The
        human figure is the most often represented engaged in different activities
        -hunting, walking, dancing- either isolated or in groups of up to forty people.
        The figures are depicted in different styles, from the very schematic to relatively
        naturalistic outlines, with men far more represented than women, and usually
        depicted carrying bows and arrows. In some cases, these figures are part of
        very complex scenes including animals and geometric symbols, some of which
        have been interpreted as trance-like scenes similar to those in South Africa
        with figures bleeding from their noses, crouching or dancing in groups or
        sharing animal traits. A very specific type of depiction is human figures
        with hugely distended abdomens, a trait that is associated either with fertility
        or mystic potency concepts.

      body: 'Along with human figures, animals are widely represented in Zimbabwean
        rock art, with kudu depictions dominating, but also with zebra, tsessebe and
        sable antelopes commonly represented. Surprisingly, other antelopes such as
        eland, waterbucks or wildebeest are very rarely represented, while other animals
        (lions, cheetah, birds, ant bears, porcupines, baboons or warthogs) are very
        scarce. Fish and crocodiles are relatively common, the latter represented
        as if seen from above or below. There seems to be a preference for the depiction
        of females rather than males, especially in the case of antelopes or elephants.
        Regardless of the type of animal, the depictions seem to have a deep symbolism
        far beyond the representation of animals just hunted and consumed, often being
        surrounded by dots, flecks or networks of lines. That symbolism is especially
        important in the case of the elephant, which is often depicted being hunted
        by groups of men. '

        Traditionally, the themes expressed in Zimbabwean rock art have been identified as the same as those of the San\\|Bushmen¹ from South Africa and in many cases are undoubtedly related, and provide key hints for their interpretation. However, there are also differences, such as the emphasis given to different animals, the higher presence of trees and plants in Zimbabwe or the smaller presence of trance scenes in the north compared to that of the Drakensberg. Moreover, the lack of ethnographic information for Zimbabwean paintings and their older chronology make it difficult to establish the same type of associations as those made for other areas with more direct connections rock art to known cultures, as happens in South Africa. Although in a minority, rock art of a later chronology can be attributed to Iron Age farmers, characterized by more schematic figures, usually white and painted thickly with the finger or the hand. As is the case in other areas in Central Africa, some of these later depictions are related to rain making and initiation ceremonies.

        ¹ San\\|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

      body: "As with much rock art, the dating of Zimbabwe paintings is a challenging
        subject, although there is a consensus about them being significantly older
        than those of the Drakensberg and probably dated at before 2,000 years ago.
        The lack of any type of agriculture-related images in the paintings, which
        was established by the 1st millennium AD, sets a relative dating for the depictions,
        while the scarcity of sheep (introduced by the second half of the first millennium
        BC in the area) points to a time period in which these animals were still
        uncommon. These hints and the fact that, unlike in other areas there are not
        historical subjects represented in the paintings, seems to indicate that Zimbabwean
        paintings are at least 1,000 years old. However, archaeological evidence (Walker
        2012: 44) suggests that rock art could be significantly older than that, at
        least several thousands of years old. \n\n"
