        Oukaïmeden is an alpine-like valley set 2,630 metres above sea level at the core of Morocco’s High Atlas. Records from the 16th century onwards refer to its seasonal profit as summer pasturage by herders coming from villages settled at mid-altitude. It is a well-known place due to the existence of a ski resort, and a well-frequented tourist destination for people coming from Marrakech during the summer. It is also home to one of the most impressive collections of rock art engravings in Morocco, with about 250 rock art sites and one thousand depictions scattered throughout the valley.
        Oukaïmeden rock art has been thoroughly studied by Malhome (1959, 1961) and Rodrigue (1999), and along with the Yagour plateau and Jbel Rat constitute the core of High Atlas rock art.

      body: High Atlas rock art is remarkably different not only from the rest of
        Moroccan rock art, but also from most other depictions documented throughout
        the Sahara. Although some of the engravings correspond to cattle depictions
        similar to those of nearby regions, there are other images known only in this
        region. One particular type comprises detailed, large human figures represented
        frontally, surrounded by weapons and other symbols. Another common kind of
        depiction is circular shapes with inner designs, which most probably represent
        shields. Weapons are also very common, usually depicted in isolation, but
        not held by warriors as is common in most of the North African images. Together
        with these themes, Oukaïmeden is characterised by a significant number of
        elephant representations (something surprising considering its altitude!)
        and a huge number of complex, geometric symbols whose interpretation remains
        obscure.

      body: Chronologically speaking, it seems Oukaïmeden engravings started to appear
        during the mid-3rd millennium BC, when the Sahara desert became increasingly
        drier and summer grazing became more and more important. The earliest depictions
        consisted mainly of animals, especially cattle, which was the species that
        benefited the most from green pastures. As time passed, pressure on this resource
        grew and tensions arose among the communities that used the valley. From the
        2nd millennium BC onwards, animal depictions were replaced by images of weapons
        and warriors, showing a different, more violent way of reclaiming rights over
        pastures. That situation continued during the long Libyan-Berber period that
        started around the mid-1st millennium BC and lasted until the Muslim conquest
        of the area, around the 7th century AD. The arrival of Islam does not imply
        the immediate disappearance of rock art engravings, but their number decreased
        significantly and they progressively lost their significance, becoming incidental
        in Oukaïmeden history.

        Although Oukaïmeden rock art is distributed throughout the valley, there are some sites with scenes that stand above the rest due to their complexity and significance. One of them is the so-called Elephants’ Frieze, a horizontal rock face where four elephants, a feline, a rhinoceros or warthog and two human figures facing the animals were depicted. Two later, vertical Libyan-Berber inscriptions were added to the panel. The scene is placed near a shelter, facing a stream which constitutes one of the main access routes to the valley grazing areas.

        The relevance of Oukaïmeden rock art is renowned, and the whole area has been protected since 1951 by the Moroccan government, while the National Centre of Rock Art Heritage in Marrakech has carried on several research projects in the area. However, the interest in the site doesn’t mean its preservation is assured: the growing incidence of tourism, the extraction of stones for building purposes in nearby Marrakech and vandalism are threats that have still to be dealt with. The fragile environment of Oukaïmeden valley adds an extra concern about the preservation of one of the most complete and better-preserved rock sites in Morocco.

        could be up to 5,000 years old, and include domestic and wild animals, warriors,
        weapons and scenes of battles and hunting. Antelope and cattle are the most
        represented animals in Moroccan rock art, although elephants and rhinoceros
        are common too.'

      title: Geography and rock art distribution
      title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 2'
      body: Morocco has a very variable geography, with the Atlas Mountains crossing
        the country from the southwest to the northeast and separating the coastal
        plains to the west from the Sahara Desert that runs to the east and south.
        The distribution of rock art in the country is very irregular, with some zones
        crowded with sites and others almost devoid of depictions. The two main areas
        of rock art sites are the High Atlas zone and the area to the east and south
        of the Atlas Mountains. The first area groups more than seven thousand engravings
        around the Oukaïmeden valley, the Yagour plateau and the Jebel Rat site. They
        are at high altitude (more than 2000 metres above sea level), and mainly represent
        weapons, cattle and anthropomorphic figures, along with numerous geometric
        symbols.

      body: The second main zone, an arid region where the majority of Moroccan rock
        art sites are situated, contains the oldest engravings in the country, some
        of them linked to the Saharan styles. The variety of themes depicted is wide,
        from abundant scenes of riders to isolated animals or complex geometric symbols.
        This collection comprises about seven hundred images, most of them corresponding
        to the southern area of Morocco around the Draa valley and the town of Tata,
        although a High Atlas (Oukaïmeden) site is also included.

      title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 4'
      body: 'European audiences began studying the rock art in Morocco decades after
        the study of rock art in Algeria and Libya, with the first news of rock art
        coming from French and German travellers late in the 19th century. The most
        significant boost came after the Treaty of Fes in 1912, when the presence
        of the colonial authorities led indirectly to an increasing knowledge of rock
        art sites, as Spanish and French officers started to show interest in the
        engravings. However, it was not until after Moroccan independence in 1956
        that systematic research began throughout the country. Since then, archaeological
        information has progressively grown, although regional syntheses are still
        scarce: only the Atlas (Malhomme, Rodrigue) and part of southern Morocco (Simoneau)
        have exhaustive catalogues of sites. The first comprehensive study of Moroccan
        rock art was made in 2001 (Searight), when for the first time, a global approach
        to Moroccan rock art areas, themes and chronology was undertaken.'

        cattle, horses and different types of antelope. Many other animals, such as
        giraffes, elephants, rhinoceros, dromedaries or lions are depicted, if more
        scarcely. The second main theme is human figures, especially in the south
        of the country, where depictions of Libyan-Berber riders are very common.
        In the High Atlas area they are usually depicted isolated, surrounded by weapons,
        which are another big theme in Moroccan rock art: a panoply of these can be
        seen, including daggers, bows and arrows, spears, shields, axes and halberds.'

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 6'
      body: A consensus has yet to be achieved about Moroccan rock art chronology
        between the supporters of a long chronology, starting around 4000 BC, and
        those that defend a short one, from 2500 BC onwards. The oldest engravings
        represented in Moroccan rock art correspond to the Tazina and Pecked Cattle
        styles, depicting mainly mammals. From the second half of the second millennium
        BC onwards, depictions of human figures start to appear in the High Atlas,
        associated with daggers and shields, defining the so-called Dagger/Halberd/Anthropomorph
        style. During the first millennium BC, Libyan-Berber hunting and battle scenes
        start to appear in southern Morocco; riders, infantrymen and animals depicted
        in a very schematic style. The last period of Moroccan rock art, as in the
        rest of the Sahara, is the so-called Camel Period, characterized by the appearance
        of dromedaries.
