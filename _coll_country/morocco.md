        Oukaïmeden is an alpine-like valley set 2,630 metres above sea level at the core of Morocco’s High Atlas. Records from the 16th century onwards refer to its seasonal profit as summer pasturage by herders coming from villages settled at mid-altitude. It is a well-known place due to the existence of a ski resort, and a well-frequented tourist destination for people coming from Marrakech during the summer. It is also home to one of the most impressive collections of rock art engravings in Morocco, with about 250 rock art sites and one thousand depictions scattered throughout the valley.
        Oukaïmeden rock art has been thoroughly studied by Malhome (1959, 1961) and Rodrigue (1999), and along with the Yagour plateau and Jbel Rat constitute the core of High Atlas rock art.

      body: High Atlas rock art is remarkably different not only from the rest of
        Moroccan rock art, but also from most other depictions documented throughout
        the Sahara. Although some of the engravings correspond to cattle depictions
        similar to those of nearby regions, there are other images known only in this
        region. One particular type comprises detailed, large human figures represented
        frontally, surrounded by weapons and other symbols. Another common kind of
        depiction is circular shapes with inner designs, which most probably represent
        shields. Weapons are also very common, usually depicted in isolation, but
        not held by warriors as is common in most of the North African images. Together
        with these themes, Oukaïmeden is characterised by a significant number of
        elephant representations (something surprising considering its altitude!)
        and a huge number of complex, geometric symbols whose interpretation remains
        obscure.

      body: Chronologically speaking, it seems Oukaïmeden engravings started to appear
        during the mid-3rd millennium BC, when the Sahara desert became increasingly
        drier and summer grazing became more and more important. The earliest depictions
        consisted mainly of animals, especially cattle, which was the species that
        benefited the most from green pastures. As time passed, pressure on this resource
        grew and tensions arose among the communities that used the valley. From the
        2nd millennium BC onwards, animal depictions were replaced by images of weapons
        and warriors, showing a different, more violent way of reclaiming rights over
        pastures. That situation continued during the long Libyan-Berber period that
        started around the mid-1st millennium BC and lasted until the Muslim conquest
        of the area, around the 7th century AD. The arrival of Islam does not imply
        the immediate disappearance of rock art engravings, but their number decreased
        significantly and they progressively lost their significance, becoming incidental
        in Oukaïmeden history.

        Although Oukaïmeden rock art is distributed throughout the valley, there are some sites with scenes that stand above the rest due to their complexity and significance. One of them is the so-called Elephants’ Frieze, a horizontal rock face where four elephants, a feline, a rhinoceros or warthog and two human figures facing the animals were depicted. Two later, vertical Libyan-Berber inscriptions were added to the panel. The scene is placed near a shelter, facing a stream which constitutes one of the main access routes to the valley grazing areas.

        The relevance of Oukaïmeden rock art is renowned, and the whole area has been protected since 1951 by the Moroccan government, while the National Centre of Rock Art Heritage in Marrakech has carried on several research projects in the area. However, the interest in the site doesn’t mean its preservation is assured: the growing incidence of tourism, the extraction of stones for building purposes in nearby Marrakech and vandalism are threats that have still to be dealt with. The fragile environment of Oukaïmeden valley adds an extra concern about the preservation of one of the most complete and better-preserved rock sites in Morocco.

        show us one of the earliest written languages in Africa and represent a most
        interesting and challenging topic in North African history. They appear in
        two different formats: engraved on *stelae* (mainly on the Mediterranean coast
        and its hinterland) or on rock faces, either isolated or alongside rock art
        paintings or engravings of the later periods of rock art.'

      body: Libyco-Berber characters were identified as written language as early
        as the 17th century, when some inscriptions in the language were documented
        in the Roman city of Dougga (Tunisia). They were deciphered by F. de Saulcy
        in 1843 through the comparison of personal names with equivalent Punic names
        in bilingual scenes, although a few characters still remain uncertain. Since
        the beginning of the 19th century onwards many different proposals have been
        made to explain the origin, expansion and translation of these alphabets.
        There are three main explanations of its origin - the most accepted theory
        considers that the Libyco-Berber alphabet and principles of writing were borrowed
        from the Phoenician script, with other symbols added locally.

        deriving from a stock of ancient signs –tribal tattoos, marks of ownership,
        or even geometric rock art- which could have resulted in the creation of the
        alphabet. Finally, a mixture of both theories accepts the borrowing of the
        idea of script and some Phoenician signs, which would be complemented with
        indigenous symbols. Although none of these theories can be fully accepted
        or refuted at the present moment, the proposal of a Phoenician borrowing has
        a wider support among linguistics and archaeologists.

      body: 'The study of Libyco-Berber script faces some huge challenges. In addition
        to its aforementioned variability, it is necessary to differentiate the ancient
        languages spoken and written in North Africa during the Classical Antiquity
        for which a generic term of Libyco-Berber is used. Furthermore, Tifinagh script,
        the modern script of Tuareg people shares some symbols with the Libyco-Berber
        alphabet, but otherwise is a quite different language. Contemporary Tuareg
        cannot understand the old Libyco-Berber inscriptions although they recognize
        some symbols. Chronology represents another challenge: although the first
        dated inscription on a *stela* is from 138 BC, some pottery sherds with Libyco-Berber
        symbols could date from the 3rd century BC. For some researchers the oldest
        date (as old as the 7th century BC) is believed to correspond to an engraving
        located in the Moroccan High Atlas, although that theory is still under discussion.
        Finally, the characteristics of the scripts present some problems: they are
        usually short, repetitive and in many cases incomplete. Moreover, Libyco-Berber
        can be written in different directions (from right to left, bottom to top),
        complicating the identification, transcription and translation of the inscriptions. '

      body: Considering all these problems, what do we know about Libyco-Berber scripts?
        First of all, they normally used only consonants, although due to the influence
        of Punic (the language used in areas controlled or influenced by Carthage)
        and Latin, vowels were added in some alphabet variants. The translation of
        Libyco-Berber scripts is complicated, since the existing texts are very short
        and can only be translated through comparison with equivalent texts in Punic
        or Latin. Most of the translated scripts are very simple and correspond to
        personal and site names, or fixed formulations as “X son of Y”, characteristics
        of funerary epigraphy, or others such as, “It’s me, X”.  Perhaps surprisingly,
        some of the translated inscriptions have an amorous meaning, with expressions
        as “I, X, love Y”. As the known Libyco-Berber corpus of inscriptions grows,
        it seems possible that more and more inscriptions will be translated, leading
        to a better understanding of the languages.

        is still going on about the chronologies and rhythms of this process. After
        the adoption and development of the alphabet, the Libyco-Berber reached a
        consideration of “official language” in the Numidian kingdom, which flourished
        in the north-western coast of Africa during the two latest centuries BC. The
        kingdom was highly influenced by Carthage and Rome, resulting in the existence
        of bilingual inscriptions that were the key to the translation of Libyco-Berber
        scripts. After Roman conquest, Libyco-Berber was progressively abandoned as
        a written language in the area, but inscriptions in the Sahara were still
        common until an unknown moment in the first millennium BC (the scripts sometimes
        receiving the name of Tifinagh). The Berber language, however, has been preserved
        and a new alphabet was developed in the 1960s to be used by Berber people.

        with paintings of the Horse and Camel periods and thus considered to be up
        to 3,000 years old. Using the term Tifinagh could lead to misunderstandings

      body: Undoubtedly, the deciphering of forgotten languages captures the imagination
        and is one of the most exciting challenges in the study of ancient cultures.
        However, it is usually a difficult enterprise, as extraordinary finds which
        aid translation such as the Rosetta Stone are fairly exceptional and most
        of the time the transcription and translation of these languages is a long
        and difficult process in which the meaning of words and grammar rules is slowly
        unravelled. Although there are no shortcuts to this method, there are some
        initiatives that help to ease the task. One of them is making available catalogues
        of high quality images of inscriptions which can be studied and analysed by
        specialists. In that sense, the Libyco-Berber inscriptions present in the
        Rock Art Image Project catalogue can be truly helpful for all those interested
        in one of the most fascinating languages in the world; a language, which albeit
        modified  has endured in different forms for hundreds of years.

      body: Fishing is an ancient practice in Africa, dating back 100,000 years, when
        modern humans started moving into coastal environments. The remains of thousands
        of fish bones and shellfish from sites on the southern African coastline dating
        to the Middle Stone Age testify to its antiquity. At the same time that human
        populations in Africa were developing more sophisticated terrestrial hunting
        technologies, they were also acquiring innovative and productive fishing and
        riverine hunting skills. Concomitantly, marine shells were being collected
        to thread on to twine, probably for use as items of personal ornamentation.
        Archaeological research has shown that aquatic environments have been exploited
        for both subsistence and cultural purposes for tens of thousands of years.

        We rarely consider the Sahara as the optimum environment for fishing. Seeing painted and engraved images of fish located in these waterless and unfavourable landscapes therefore seems at odds with our present-day knowledge of this vast desert. However, as we have noted before in these project pages (see introductions to Libya and Algeria), water-dependent animals such as crocodile and hippo have regularly been depicted in Saharan rock art, illustrating a once wetter and more fertile landscape. To date, the African rock art image project has catalogued representations of aquatic species in Libya, Algeria and Morocco, depicted with varying degrees of proficiency and ease of identification. This has been an insightful encounter, because it not only informs our thinking about the nature of the environment in the past and the way people were using their available resources, but also allows us to think about the cultural importance of water-based species.

        The rock art in these places is a glimpse into an aquatic past that is now supported by environmental evidence. In a recent collaborative project mapping ancient watercourses in the Sahara, it has been shown that during the Holocene (a period which started around 11,700 years ago), this now arid landscape was once covered by a dense interconnected river system, as well as large bodies of water known as ‘megalakes’. When these lakes overflowed, they linked catchment areas, resulting in a dense palaeoriver network that allowed water-dependent life (fish, molluscs and amphibians) to migrate and disperse across an extensive landscape. This interlinked waterway of the Sahara formed a single and vast biogeographic area. Perhaps not surprisingly, rock art sites appear to be clustered around inland deltas where resources would have been most plentiful.

        Across the Sahara, at least twenty-three species of fish have been identified in archaeological deposits from the Holocene, the most common being Tilapia, Catfish, African jewelfish, Silver fish and Nile perch. But can we go as far as to correlate the archaeological record with the rock art to species level?

      body: Rock art imagery is replete with both very naturalistic representations
        and also those which are more conceptual or abstract in nature, and the depictions
        of fish are no exception. While some representations are clearly identifiable
        as fish, other are more difficult to identify. For example, the image above
        from Afforzighiar shows vertical red dots on the left of the photograph are
        arranged in a fish-like shape that converges at the top and bottom. Additionally
        it has been deliberately placed on a section of the rock face where there
        is water seepage, blending the art with the natural environment. The dotted
        pattern is reminiscent of the African jewelfish (*Hemichromis bimaculatus*)
        or even the Redbelly Tilapia (*Tilapia zillii*), both shown to be species
        of fish found throughout much of the Sahara during the Holocene.

      body: Some of the engravings bear close morphological resemblances to Catfish,
        with even the barbels depicted. Catfish seem to occur more regularly in rock
        art than other species of fish, possibly due to their physical characteristics.
        They possess an auxiliary breathing organ which allows them to inhabit extremely
        de-oxygenated water; in fact, when necessary they can obtain up to 50% of
        their total oxygen requirements from the air. In some cases they will leave
        the water and crawl on dry ground to escape drying pools. This capacity to
        live in very shallow waters and to occupy the liminal spaces between land
        and water has elevated them to more than a simple food source and given them
        a place of cultural significance in many African societies.

      body: In arid ecosystems, bodies of water are characterised by daily and seasonal
        fluctuations in water temperature, evaporation and other natural phenomena,
        and some fish species have adapted well to cope with these extreme changes
        in water chemistry. Catfish and Tilapia in particular are able to survive
        high salinity, which occurs through evaporation, while Redbelly Tilapia can
        also tolerate temperatures above 35° C. Both Sharptooth Catfish and Tilapia
        are floodplain dwellers and possess the ability to live and spawn in shallow
        waters, making them easily susceptible to predation. Catfish spines were also
        used to decorate Saharan pottery with dotted wavy-line patterns. These biological
        characteristics, which meant they could be easily hunted, may explain their
        frequent depiction in rock art. Perhaps their value was also reinforced by
        their being (possibly) the last fish species to survive once aridification
        had taken hold in the Sahara.

      title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 6'
      body: Fish are likely to have been caught in a variety of ways, but in the Sahara
        the most common technique was to use barbed bone point and/or fish hook technology,
        with the former being the most archaeologically visible. Barbed points may
        either be fixed – that is permanently attached to a spear or arrow shaft –
        or used as ‘harpoons’, when they separate from a shaft on impact and remain
        attached by a line. Barbed points can actually be used to catch multiple types
        of prey, but the primary use across Africa was for fish.

      body: Chronologically, the earliest barbed bone point records are from Katanda
        in the Upper Semliki Valley in modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo,
        dating to 80,000 – 90,000 years ago. Here people were catching Catfish weighing
        up to 68 kg (150 lb), sufficient to feed eighty people for two days. Research
        has noted the distribution of barbed bone points across the Sahara, and the
        correlation between these locations and the distribution of species requiring
        deep water. It is clear that there is continuity in sophisticated fishing
        technology and practice that has lasted tens of thousands of years.

      title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 8'
      body: Other aquatic species are more difficult to identify and are much rarer.
        For example, the image below has been interpreted as a jelly-fish like creature.
        However, by manipulating the colour and lighting, the image is a little clearer
        and appears to share morphological characteristics, such as the rounded carapace
        and small flippers, with a turtle rather than a jellyfish. Furthermore, we
        know that softshell turtles (*Trionyx triunguis*) have been found in archaeological
        deposits in the Sahara dating to the Holocene. The vertical and wavy strands
        hanging down underneath could represent the pattern made in the sand by turtles
        when walking rather than being the tendrils of a jellyfish. In addition, the
        image from Wadi Tafak below appears to resemble a snail, and is consistent
        with what we know about the Capsian culture who inhabited modern Tunisia,
        Algeria, and parts of Libya during the early Holocene (10000–6000 BC). Their
        distinguishing culinary feature was a fondness for escargots – edible land
        snails.

      body: A recently excavated cemetery site called Gobero (Sereno *et al.* 2008),
        situated on the western edge of the Ténéré desert in Niger, provides a uniquely
        preserved record of human occupation in the Sahara during the Holocene and
        puts into context some of the examples of rock art we have looked at here.
        Pollen analysis has indicated that during the Holocene, Gobero was situated
        in an open savannah landscape of grasses and sedges, with fig trees and tamarisk,
        where permanent water and marshy habitats were present.

        Approximately 200 burials, ranging over a 5000-year period, were found on the edge of an ancient lake. Grave goods include bones or tusks from wild fauna, ceramics, lithic projectile points, and bone, ivory and shell ornaments. One adult male was buried in a recumbent pose seated on the carapace of a mud turtle. Microliths, bone harpoon points and hooks, and ceramics with dotted wavy-line and zigzag impressed motifs were found in the burial fill, in an associated midden area, and in nearby paleolake deposits. Nile perch (*Lates niloticus*), large catfish, and tilapia dominate the midden fauna, which also includes bones and teeth from hippos, several bovids, small carnivores, softshell turtles and crocodiles.

        The early Holocene occupants at Gobero (7700–6300 BC.) were largely sedentary hunter-fisher-gatherers with lakeside funerary sites. Across the ‘green’ Sahara, Catfish, Tilapia and turtles played important roles socially, economically and culturally. We can see this most explicitly in the burial within a turtle carapace in Gobero, but the representation of aquatic animals in rock art is a significant testament to their value.

      title: Horses and chariots
      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 2'
      body: The first introduction of the domestic horse to Ancient Egypt- and thereby
        to Africa- is usually cited at around 1600 BC, linked with the arrival in
        Egypt of the Hyksos, a group from the Levant who ruled much of Northern Egypt
        during the Second Intermediate Period. By this point, horses had probably
        only been domesticated for about 2,000 years, but with the advent of the chariot
        after the 3rd millennium BC in Mesopotamia, the horse proved to be a valuable
        martial asset in the ancient world. One of the first clear records of the
        use of horses and chariots in battle in Africa is found in depictions from
        the mortuary complex of the Pharaoh Ahmose at Abydos from around 1525 BC,
        showing their use by Egyptians in defeating the Hyksos, and horses feature
        prominently in later Egyptian art.

      body: 'Some of the most renowned images of horses in Saharan rock art are also
        those of chariot teams: in particular, those of the so-called ‘flying gallop’
        style chariot pictures, from the Tassili n’Ajjer and Acacus mountains in modern
        Algeria and Libya. These distinctive images are characterised by depictions
        of one or more horses pulling a chariot with their legs outstretched in a
        stylised manner and are sometimes attributed to the Garamantes, a group who
        were a local power in the central Sahara from about 500 BC-700 AD. But the
        Ajjer Plateau is over a thousand miles from the Nile- how and when did the
        horse and chariot first make their way across the Western Desert to the rest
        of North Africa in the first place? Egyptian accounts indicate that by the
        11th century BC Libyans (people living on the north African coast around the
        border of modern Egypt and Libya) were using chariots in war. Classical sources
        later write about the chariots of the Garamantes and of chariot use by peoples
        of the far western Sahara continuing into the 1st century BC, by which time
        the chariot horse had largely been eclipsed in war by the cavalry mount.'

      body: As well as the unique iconography of rock art chariot depictions, there
        are also numerous paintings and engravings across northern Africa of people
        riding horses. Riding may have been practiced since the earliest times of
        horse domestication, though the earliest definitive depictions of horses being
        ridden come from the Middle East in the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia BC.
        Images of horses and riders in rock art occur in various areas of Morocco,
        Egypt and Sudan and are particularly notable in the Ennedi region of Chad
        and the Adrar and Tagant plateaus in Mauritania (interestingly, however, no
        definite images of horses are known in the Gilf Kebir/Jebel Uweinat area at
        the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya).

      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 5'
      body: Traditional chronologies for Saharan rock art areas tend to place depictions
        of ridden horses chronologically after those of horses and chariots, and in
        general use horse depictions to categorise regional stylistic periods of rock
        art according to broad date boundaries. As such, in most places, the ‘horse’
        rock art period is usually said to cover about a thousand years from the end
        of the 2nd millennium BC. It is then considered to be succeeded by a ‘camel’
        period, where the appearance of images of dromedaries – known only to have
        been introduced to the eastern Sahara from Arabia at the end of the 1st century
        BC – reflects the next momentous influx of a beast of burden to the area and
        thus a new dating parameter ([read more about depictions of camels in the
        Sahara](https://africanrockart.britishmuseum.org/thematic/camels-in-saharan-rock-art/)).
        However, such simplistic categorisation can be misleading. For one thing,
        although mounting horses certainly gained popularity over driving them, it
        is not always clear that depictions of ridden horses are not contemporary
        with those of chariots. Further, the horse remained an important martial tool
        after the use of war-chariots declined. Even after the introduction of the
        camel, there are several apparently contemporary depictions featuring both
        horse and camel riders.

      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 6'
      body: As the more manoeuvrable rider rose in popularity against the chariot
        as a weapon of war, historical reports from classical authors like Strabo
        tell us of the prowess of African horsemen such as the cavalry of the Numidians,
        a Berber group that allied with Carthage against the Romans in the 3rd century
        BC. Berber peoples would remain heavily associated with horse breeding and
        riding, and the later rock art of Mauritania has been attributed to Berber
        horsemen, or the sight of them. Although horses may already have reached the
        areas of modern Mauritania and Mali by this point, archaeological evidence
        does not confirm their presence in these south-westerly regions of the Sahara
        until much later, in the mid-1st millennium AD, and it has been suggested
        that some of the horse paintings in Mauritania may be as recent as 16th century.

      body: 'Another intriguing possibility is that of gaining clues on the origins
        of modern horse breeds from rock art, in particular the ancient Barb breed
        native to the Maghreb, where it is still bred. Ancient Mesopotamian horses
        were generally depicted as heavily-built, and it has been suggested that the
        basic type for the delicate Arabian horse, with its dished (concave) facial
        profile and high-set tail, may have been developed in north-east Africa prior
        to its subsequent appearance and cultivation in Arabia, and that these features
        may be observed in Ancient Egyptian images from the New Kingdom. Likewise,
        there is the possibility that some of the more naturalistic paintings from
        the central Sahara show the similarly gracile features of the progenitors
        of the Barb, distinguishable from the Arab by its straight profile and low-set
        tail. Like the Arab, the Barb is a desert horse: hardy, sure-footed and able
        to withstand great heat; it is recognised as an ancient breed with an important
        genetic legacy, both in the ancestry of the Iberian horses later used throughout
        the Americas, and that of the modern racing thoroughbred.'

      body: However, caution must be taken in drawing such comparisons based on morphology
        alone, especially given the gulf of time that has elapsed and the relative
        paucity of ‘naturalistic’ rock art images. Indeed, there is huge diversity
        of horse depictions throughout northern Africa, with some forms highly schematic.
        This variation is not only in style – and, as previously noted, in time period
        and geography – but also in context, as of course images of one subject cannot
        be divorced from the other images around them, on whichever surface has been
        chosen, and are integral to these surroundings.

      body: The nature of the depictions in this sense speaks intriguingly of the
        apparent symbolism and implied value of the horse image in different cultural
        contexts. Where some Tassilian horses are delicately painted in lifelike detail,
        the stockier images of horses associated with the so-called ‘Libyan Warrior’
        style petroglyphs of the Aïr mountains and Adrar des Ifoghas in Niger and
        Mali appear more as symbolic accoutrements to the central human figures and
        tend not to be shown as ridden. By contrast, there are paintings in the Ennedi
        plateau of Chad where galloping horse figures have clearly been painted over
        existing walking human figures to make them appear as if riding.

        In each of these cases, the original symbolic intent of the artists have been lost to time, but with these horse depictions, as with so much African rock art imagery, there is great scope for further future analysis. Particularly intriguing, for example, are the striking stylistic similarities in horse depictions across great distances, such the horse depictions with bi-triangular bodies (e.g. figs 5 &13), or with fishbone-style tails which may be found almost two thousand miles apart in Chad and Mauritania.

        Whatever the myriad circumstances and significances of the images, it is clear that following its introduction to the continent, the hardy and surefooted desert horse’s usefulness for draught, transport and fighting purposes transformed the societies which used it and gave it a powerful symbolic value.

      body: |+
        Although the styles and subjects of north African rock art vary, there are commonalities: images are most often figurative and frequently depict animals, both wild and domestic. There are also many images of human figures, sometimes with accessories such as recognisable weaponry or clothing. These may be painted or engraved, with frequent occurrences of both, at times in the same context. Engravings are generally more common, although this may simply be a preservation bias due to their greater durability.

        The physical context of rock art sites varies depending on geographical and topographical factors – for example, Moroccan rock engravings are often found on open rocky outcrops, while Tunisia’s Djebibina rock art sites have all been found in rock shelters. Rock art in the vast and harsh environments of the Sahara is often inaccessible and hard to find, and there is probably a great deal of rock art that is yet to be seen by archaeologists; what is known has mostly been documented within the last century.

        the Messak Plateau in Libya in 1850, first noting the existence of engravings.
        Further explorations in the early twentieth century by celebrated travellers,
        ethnographers and archaeologists such as Hassanein Bey, Abbé Breuil, László
        Almásy, Henri Lhote and Leo Frobenius brought the rock art of Sahara, and
        northern Africa in general, to the awareness of a European public.

        have sought to date and attribute these artworks, with varying measures of
        success. Rock art may be associated with certain cultures through known parallels
        with the imagery in other artefacts, such as Naqada Period designs in Egyptian
        rock art that mirror those on dateable pottery. Authorship may be also guessed
        at through corroborating evidence: for example, due to knowledge of their
        chariot use, and the location of rock art depicting chariots in the central
        Sahara, it has been suggested that it was produced by – or at the same time
        as – the height of the Garamantes culture, a historical ethnic group who formed
        a local power around what is now southern Libya from 500 BC–700 AD. However,
        opportunities to anchor rock art imagery in this way to known ancient cultures
        are few and far between, and rock art is generally ascribed to anonymous hunter-gatherers,
        nomadic peoples, or pastoralists, with occasional imagery-based comparisons
        made with contemporary groups, such as the Fulani peoples.'

        Occasionally, association with writing in the form of, for example, Libyan-Berber or Arabic graffiti can give a known dating margin, but in general, lack of contemporary writing and written sources (Herodotus wrote about the Garamantes) leaves much open to conjecture.

        Other forms of (rare) circumstantial evidence, such as rock art covered by a dateable stratigraphic layer, and (more common) stylistic image-based dating have been used instead to form a chronology of Saharan rock art periods that is widely agreed upon, although dates are contested. The first stage, known as the Early Hunter, Wild Fauna or Bubalus Period, is posited at about 12,000–6,000 years ago, and is typified by naturalistic engravings of wild animals, in particular an extinct form of buffalo identifiable by its long horns.

        to 8,000 years ago) due to the large discoid heads of the painted human figures.
        Following this is the most widespread style, the Pastoral Period (around 7,500
        to 4,000 years ago), which is characterised by numerous paintings and engravings
        of cows, as well as occasional hunting scenes. The Horse Period (around 3,000
        to 2,000 years ago) features recognisable horses and chariots and the final
        Camel Period (around 2,000 years ago to present) features domestic dromedary
        camels, which we know to have been widely used across the Sahara from that
        time.

      body: "While this chronology serves as a useful framework, it must be remembered
        that the area – and the time period in which rock art was produced – is extensive
        and there is significant temporal and spatial variability within and across
        sites. There are some commonalities in rock art styles and themes across the
        Sahara, but there are also regional variations and idiosyncrasies, and a lack
        of evidence that any of these were directly, or even indirectly, related.
        The engravings of weaponry motifs from Morocco and the painted ‘swimming’
        figures of the Gilf Kebir Plateau in Egypt and Sudan are not only completely
        different, but unique to their areas. Being thousands of kilometres apart
        and so different in style and composition, they serve to illustrate the limitations
        inherent in examining northern African rock art as a unit. The contemporary
        political and environmental challenges to accessing rock art sites in countries
        across the Sahara serves as another limiting factor in their study, but as
        dating techniques improve and further discoveries are made, this is a field
        with the potential to help illuminate much of the prehistory of northern Africa.\n\n"

        so far, mainly located in two areas: the High Atlas Mountains, and the Sahara
        desert region to the south and east. They comprise mainly engravings, which
        could be up to 5,000 years old, and include domestic and wild animals, warriors,
        weapons and scenes of battles and hunting. Antelope and cattle are the most
        represented animals in Moroccan rock art, although elephants and rhinoceros
        are common too.'

        the country from the southwest to the northeast and separating the coastal
        plains to the west from the Sahara Desert that runs to the east and south.
        The distribution of rock art in the country is very irregular, with some zones
        crowded with sites and others almost devoid of depictions. The two main areas
        of rock art sites are the High Atlas zone and the area to the east and south
        of the Atlas Mountains. The first area groups more than seven thousand engravings
        around the Oukaïmeden valley, the Yagour plateau and the Jebel Rat site. They
        are at high altitude (more than 2000 metres above sea level), and mainly represent
        weapons, cattle and anthropomorphic figures, along with numerous geometric
        symbols.

        the study of rock art in Algeria and Libya, with the first news of rock art
        coming from French and German travellers late in the 19th century. The most
        significant boost came after the Treaty of Fes in 1912, when the presence
        of the colonial authorities led indirectly to an increasing knowledge of rock
        art sites, as Spanish and French officers started to show interest in the
        engravings. However, it was not until after Moroccan independence in 1956
        that systematic research began throughout the country. Since then, archaeological
        information has progressively grown, although regional syntheses are still
        scarce: only the Atlas (Malhomme, Rodrigue) and part of southern Morocco (Simoneau)
        have exhaustive catalogues of sites. The first comprehensive study of Moroccan
        rock art was made in 2001 (Searight), when for the first time, a global approach
        to Moroccan rock art areas, themes and chronology was undertaken.'

        In the High Atlas area they are usually depicted isolated, surrounded by weapons,

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 6'
      body: A consensus has yet to be achieved about Moroccan rock art chronology
        between the supporters of a long chronology, starting around 4000 BC, and
        those that defend a short one, from 2500 BC onwards. The oldest engravings
        represented in Moroccan rock art correspond to the Tazina and Pecked Cattle
        styles, depicting mainly mammals. From the second half of the second millennium
        BC onwards, depictions of human figures start to appear in the High Atlas,
        associated with daggers and shields, defining the so-called Dagger/Halberd/Anthropomorph
        style. During the first millennium BC, Libyan-Berber hunting and battle scenes
        start to appear in southern Morocco; riders, infantrymen and animals depicted
        in a very schematic style. The last period of Moroccan rock art, as in the
        rest of the Sahara, is the so-called Camel Period, characterized by the appearance
        of dromedaries.
