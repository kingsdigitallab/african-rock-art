      body: The Ennedi Plateau is a mountainous region in the north-eastern corner
        of Chad, an impressive sandstone massif eroded by wind and temperature changes
        into series of terraces, gorges, cliffs and outliers. Although it is part
        of the Sahara, the climate of the Ennedi Plateau is much more suitable for
        human habitation than most of the desert, with regular rain during summer,
        wadis (seasonal rivers) flowing once or twice a year, and a relatively large
        range of flora and fauna – including some of the few remaining populations
        of Saharan crocodiles west of the Nile. Throughout the caves, canyons and
        shelters of the Ennedi Plateau, thousands of images – dating from 5000 BC
        onwards – have been painted and engraved, comprising one of the biggest collections
        of rock art in the Sahara and characterised by a huge variety of styles and
        themes.

      body: 'Within this kaleidoscope, a series of engravings have become especially
        renowned for their singularity and quality: several groups of life-sized human
        figures depicted following very regular stylistic conventions. They were first
        reported internationally in the early 1950s; during the following decades
        more sites were discovered, almost all of them around Wadi Guirchi, and especially
        near a site known as Niola Doa. To date, six sites have been documented, totalling
        about 40 depictions. Most of the figures were engraved on big, vertical boulders,
        in groups, although occasionally they appear isolated. They follow a very
        regular pattern: most of them are life-sized or even bigger and are represented
        upright facing right or left, with one arm bent upwards holding a stick resting
        over the neck or shoulder and the other arm stretched downwards. In some cases,
        the figures have an unidentified, horizontal object placed at the neck, probably
        an ornament. Interspersed among the bigger figures, there are smaller versions
        which are slightly different, some of them with the arms in the same position
        as the others but without sticks, and some facing forwards with hands on hips.
        In general, figures seem to be naked, although in some cases the smaller figures
        are depicted with skirts.'

        buttocks and thighs, which have been interpreted as steatopygia (a genetic
        condition resulting in an accumulation of fat in and around the buttocks).
        Although the best documented examples of steatopygia (both in rock art and
        contemporary groups) correspond to southern Africa, steatopygic depictions
        occur elsewhere in North African rock art, with examples in other parts of
        the Ennedi Plateau, but also in Egypt and Sudan, where they occasionally appear
        incised in pottery.

        In addition, almost all the figures are decorated with intricate geometric patterns (straight and wavy lines, squares, meanders and, in one case, schematic birds), which could be interpreted as garments, tattoos, scarifications or body paintings. In some cases, figures appear simply outlined, but these very rare cases were probably left unfinished. The decorative patterns extend to the ears, which are always depicted with geometric designs, and to the head, where these designs could correspond to hairstyles.

        The decorative richness of the Niola Doa engravings has led to their interpretation as ritual scenes, probably special occasions when body decoration was part of a more complex set of activities with dancing or singing. On some occasions, comparisons have been established between the geometric designs of Niola Doa and different types of body decorations (body painting, scarifications). Scarifications, in particular, have a long tradition within some African cultures and in many cases parallels have been documented between this kind of body decoration and material culture (i.e. pottery, pipes, wood sculptures or clothes). The relative proximity of groups with well-known traditions of scarifications and body painting has led to comparisons which, although suggested, cannot be wholly proved.

      body: 'Regarding their chronology, as with most rock art depictions the Niola
        Doa figures are difficult to date, although they undoubtedly belong to the
        older periods of Chadian rock art. Some parallels have been made with the
        Round Head-style figures of the Tassili n’Ajjer (Simonis et al 1994). However,
        the Round Head figures of Algeria have a very old chronology (up to 9000 years
        ago), while the rock art at the Ennedi Plateau is assumed to be much newer,
        up to the 5th or 4th millennium BC. These engravings could, therefore, correspond
        to what has been called the Archaic Period in this area, although a Pastoral
        Period chronology has also been proposed. In several other sites around the
        Ennedi Plateau, similar images have been painted, although whether these images
        are contemporary with those of Niola Doa or correspond to a different period
        is unclear. Regardless of their chronology, what is undeniable is the major
        impact these depictions had on later generations of people living in the area:
        even now, the engravings at one of the sites are known as the ‘Dancing Maidens’,
        while the name of Niola Doa means ‘The place of the girls’ in the local language.'

        Ennedi Plateau and the Tibesti Mountains, both to the north. The depictions
        – the oldest of which date back to the fifth millennium BC – represent wild
        animals, cattle and human figures. Paintings of highly detailed riders on
        camels and horses are especially numerous, as are groups of people around
        huts. Chadian rock art is particularly well known for its variety of local
        styles, and it includes some of the richest examples of Saharan rock art.'

        Desert, while the central area is included in the Sahel border (the semi-arid
        region south of the Sahara). The southern third of the country is characterized
        by a more fertile savannah. The Ennedi Plateau and Tibesti mountains contain
        thousands of pieces of rock art, including some of the most famous examples

        Chad, on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. It is a sandstone massif
        carved by erosion in a series of superimposed terraces, alternating plains
        and ragged cliffs crossed by wadis (seasonal rivers). Unlike other areas in
        the Sahara with rock art engravings or paintings, the Ennedi Plateau receives
        rain regularly – if sparsely – during the summer, making it a more benign
        environment for human life than other areas with significant rock art to the
        north, such as the Messak plateau or the Tassili Mountains in Libya and Algeria.'

      body: |-
        Different areas of Chad have been subject to varying trajectories of research. In the Tibesti Mountains, rock art was known to Europeans as early as 1869, although it was between the 1910s and 1930s that the first studies started to be carried out, by François D’Alverny. However, the main boost in research came in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to the work of Paul Huard. Over the last 50 years, researchers have found thousands of depictions throughout the region, most of them engravings, although paintings are also well represented.

        In the case of the Ennedi Plateau, its isolated position far from the main trade routes made its rock art unknown outside the area until the 1930s. During this decade, Burthe d’Annelet brought attention to the art, and De Saint-Floris published the first paper on the subject. The main effort to document this rock art came in 1956-1957, when Gerard Bailloud recorded more than 500 sites in only a sixth of the plateau's entire area.

      title_internal: 'Chad: country, chapter 5'
      body: As in the rest of the Sahara, the main themes in Chadian rock art are
        directly linked to the chronology. The oldest depictions are of wild animals,
        but most common are later scenes with cattle, huts and people. As in other
        areas of the Sahara, the most recent depictions correspond to battle scenes
        of riders on horses and camels. Along with these main subjects, both areas
        have examples of very detailed scenes of daily life and human activities,
        including people playing music, visiting the sick or dancing. The rock art
        of both the Ennedi Plateau and the Tibesti regions is characterized by the
        existence of a variety of local styles, such as the so-called ‘Flying Gallop
        style’, sometimes simultaneous, sometimes successive. This variability means
        an enormous richness of techniques, themes and artistic conventions, with
        some of the most original styles in Saharan rock art.

      body: |-
        The oldest engravings in Chad are more recent than those to the north, having started to appear in the 5th to 4th millennia BC, and can be broadly divided into three main periods:

        The oldest is the so-called Archaic Period, characterized by wild animals in the Ennedi Plateau and Round Head-style figures in the Tibesti Mountains, similar to those found in the Central Sahara. The second phase is named the Bovine or Pastoral Period, when domestic cattle are the predominant animals, and a third, late period named the Dromedary or Camel Period. Unlike other areas in the Sahara, horse and camel depictions appear to be from roughly the same period (although horses were introduced to the Sahara first), so they are included in a generic Camel Period. The end of the rock art tradition in both areas is difficult to establish, but it seems to have lasted at least until the seventeenth century in the Ennedi Plateau, much longer than in other areas of the Sahara.
