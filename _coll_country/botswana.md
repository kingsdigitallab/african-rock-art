        art sites with more than 4,000 individual paintings, and has been termed the
        “The Louvre of the Desert”.  Designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in
        2001, Tsodilo comprises four main hill: Male Hill, Female Hill, Child Hill
        and North Hill with paintings occurring on all four. This region shows human
        occupation going back 100,000 years.  At sunset the western cliffs of the
        Hills radiate a glowing light that can be seen for miles around, for which
        the local Juc’hoansi  call them the “Copper Bracelet of the Evening”.'

      body: The paintings at Tsodilo are unique in comparison to other San&#124;Bushmen
        rock art in both techniques and subject matter. San&#124;Bushmen paintings
        are well-known throughout southern Africa for their fine-line detail because
        they were brush painted, but those at Tsodilo are finger painted. In addition,
        160 depictions of cattle are portrayed in the same style as wild animals,
        and more geometric designs appear here than anywhere else. Tsodilo animal
        drawings are larger and the geometric designs simpler than those found elsewhere.  In
        comparison to human figures elsewhere in southern Africa, those at Tsodilo
        appear without bows and arrows, clothing or any forms of personal ornamentation.  In
        addition, numerous cupules and grooves are incised and ground into rock surfaces,
        sometimes close to painted rock art sites and some on their own. For the residents
        of Tsodilo, the hills are a sacred place inhabited by spirits of the ancestors.

      body: While most of the images in the Tsodilo Hills seem to be discrete depictions,
        some sites show figures. Some of these figures are with cattle as well as
        women standing in rows in connection with animal groups, possibly showing
        some relationship with each other. Additionally, some of the rock art in the
        Tsodilo Hills shows superimposition, but this occurs infrequently. In some
        cases red geometric designs superimpose animals, but geometric designs and
        animals never superimpose human figures, nor do images of cattle ever superimpose
        other images – which may suggest some kind of relationship or hierarchy.

        antelope, snakes, unidentified animals and geometric designs, particularly

      title: Cupules/Grooves
      title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 8'
      body: There are no engravings at Tsodilo representing animals or human figures,
        but more than 25 sites show evidence of small round depressions ground into
        the rock, known as cupules, as well as various shaped grooves that have been
        chipped and ground into the rock. The majority of sites are found on Female
        Hill, with four on Male Hill and one site on Child Hill. Cupules tend to measure
        about 5cm or more wide and less than a 1 cm deep, although larger examples
        occur. They can occur at painted rock art sites but also on their own. For
        the most part they are found in groups ranging from 5 to 100 and in three
        cases, considerably more. For example, in Rhino Cave there are 346 carved
        into a vertical wall and nearly 1,100 at Depression Shelter. The purpose or
        meaning of cupules is unknown; they may have denoted a special place or the
        number of times a site had been visited. However, we have no dates for any
        of the cupules and even if they are adjacent to a rock art site, they are
        not necessarily contemporaneous. From their patina and general wear it has
        been proposed that some cupules may date back tens of thousands of years to
        the Middle Stone Age. If paintings also existed at this time they have long
        since disappeared.

        Tsodilo, as the red images at Tsodilo do not fit neatly into other known styles
        of rock art in southern Africa. They do not show the fine brush work of San&#124;Bushmen¹
        in other parts of southern Africa, nor the cruder style of white paintings
        attributed to later Bantu-speaking farmers.\n\nIt is possible that they were
        painted by the Khoesan during the first millennium AD, the original settlers
        in the area who made stone tools and herded livestock. A local Ncaekhoe man
        (a Central San people) claims his ancestors made the paintings and it is possible
        that some or many of the cattle images were painted by pastoral ancestors
        of Ncaekhoe. \n\nThe white paintings are more difficult to attribute authorship,
        although as they are comparable to the red paintings, comprising the same
        subject matter of elephant, rhino, giraffe and antelope as well as geometrics,

      body: The paintings at Tsodilo are often faded because they are located on rock
        faces exposed to the sun, wind and rain. As such, dating them scientifically
        is problematic as little or no suitable organic material remains. However,
        cattle paintings may help to date the art. There are about 160 depictions
        of cattle, which were common around the Tsodilo Hills between 800–1200 AD.
        As the cattle depictions are stylistically similar to other animal depictions
        it has been suggested that this seems to be a plausible date for most of the
        art (Coulson and Campbell, 2001:103)

        between images on the same rock. \n\nRepresentations of people are simply
        painted and generally stick-like, identified to gender by either penis or
        breasts. In some cases this may represent sexual virility and fertility, although
        in scenes where both occur it may merely indicate gender differences.\n\nCattle
        seem to appear in the rock art at the same time as human figures. In one scene,
        three figures, one leading a child, has been interpreted as either herding
        or stealing cattle (Campbell, Robbins and Taylor, 2010:106). Three other sites
        show cattle depicted with what may be mythical rain animals. \n"

        partially superimpose an animal or be placed within its outline. This superimposition
        may enhance the symbolic meaning of the animal.\n\nEither singly or in groups,
        and sometimes depicted with animals or people, geometric motifs show stylistic
        consistency across a wide area and are likely to have had some symbolic meaning.
        In Zambia, geometric designs are thought to have been be made by women and
        associated with the weather and fertility, while depictions of animals were
        made by men. The geometric rock art of Tsodilo fits into a pattern of similar
        imagery in central Africa and may be related to the same meanings of weather

        consisting of a few hundred metres with Zambia to the north. The majority
        of this flat country, around 70%, is made up of the Kalahari Desert, with
        the Okavango Delta, one of the world’s largest inland deltas located in the
        north. Botswana has a subtropical climate of hot summers and warm winters
        due to its high altitude and is semi-arid due to the short rainy season. Rock
        art is scattered across the country with the main sites being found in the
        Tsodilo Hills in the north- west;  the Gubatshaa Hills in the Chobe National
        Park, east of the Okavango Delta;  Tuli Block in the far east of the country

        German geologist Siegfried Passarge visited the Tsodilo Hills on the 1st July 1898, mapping the area, writing on the geology and photographing a few rock paintings. In 1907, he published tracings of his photos in Die Buschmänner der Kalahari. A passing mention of the Hills was made in 1913 in a brief report by Max Happe, but it was François Balsan, a French industrialist and explorer, who raised the profile of Tsodilo Hills when over two days he photographed and prepared tracings of what has come to be known as the “Rhino Panel” on September 27-28 1951.

        Laurens van der Post’s publication of *The Lost World of the Kalahari* in 1958 brought Tsodilo Hills and its rock art to the attention of the wider world. Van der Post, an Afrikaner, had planned to make a film of the rock art in the region, but a number of events including the shooting of a steenbok (a severe crime locally), the cameras jamming and swarms of bees descending upon their camp, conspired against him and resulted in van der Post leaving the Hills in despair. However, he also left an apologetic note at the rock art panel he had been trying to film as a way of assuaging the wrath of the “Spirit of the Hills” as he put it. The rock face he was trying to film, comprising eland, giraffe and handprints, is now known as “Van der Post Panel”.

        In 1963 Alec Campbell visited the region with George Silberbauer, an ethnographer who had studied the San&#124;Bushmen in Botswana. As Director of Botswana’s National Museum, Campbell had a little government funding to record the rock art and excavate the rock shelters. Subsequently he collaborated with archaeologists Larry Robbins, Mike Murphy, and paleo-geographer George Brook.

        During the 1990s, Campbell, along with the staff from the National Museum recorded around 400 rock art sites numbering over 4,000 individual paintings. In 2001 Tsodilo Hills became a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its spiritual significance to local peoples, as well as its unique record of human settlement over many millennia.

        Tuli Block is a narrow fringe of land in the far east of the country that borders South Africa and lies on the banks of the Limpopo River. This area is characterised by rock engravings of human and animal footprints, and cupules, which hold spiritual importance both for San&#124;Bushman¹ hunter-gatherers and Tswana farmers. The engravings are thought to refer to a local myth that tells of an ancestor, named Matsieng, who is believed to have emerged from a waterhole followed by his animals. However, there are several localities in the region that claim this origin myth. It is thought the engravings in this area were created by the San&#124;Bushmen and linked to their belief system, appropriated later by the Tswana farmers.

        The most renowned rock art in Botswana comes from the Tsodilo Hills in the north-west of the country. With more than 4,500 paintings preserved in an area of 10km² it has been termed the “Louvre of the Desert”.  Tsodilo is made up of four main hills; Male Hill, Female Hill, Child Hill and North Hill, and paintings occur on all four. The subject matter, comprised of red and white paintings, includes animals, human figures and geometric designs. Red paintings are likely to have been made by San&#124;Bushmen, while the white paintings are more difficult to attribute authorship to but may be a later continuation of the red tradition. There are no engraved images at Tsodilo but cupules and ground grooves are a common feature.  Dating of the paintings at Tsodilo has been difficult, and because many of them occur on exposed surfaces where they are susceptible to damage by the sun, rain and wind, what remains is probably not very old. However, paintings of cattle, which are also badly faded, probably date to between AD 800 and 1150 when people kept these animals in this area.

        ¹ San&#124;Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

      body: 'Rock art is rare in the south-east of the country, but the site of Manyana
        is noteworthy because it is the only one that has been excavated. The paintings
        are found at five sites along a rock outcrop of 0.75 km at the base of the
        Koboleng Hills, and while once richly decorated, many of the paintings have
        now faded. It is difficult to determine exactly when the paintings were made,
        but excavation shows the use of ochre from the earliest occupation levels
        dating to the Late Stone Age, around AD 100 - 800, with the latest occupation
        levels dating to the Late Iron Age, around AD 1600-1700. Interestingly, none
        of the paintings were done in white, a colour found at many other sites in
        Botswana and other regions of southern Africa, and often attributed to paintings
        of Iron Age date. In addition, there are no images of eland or figures combining
        human/antelope form which are common occurrences in South African rock art. '

        Engravings include human footprints and animal tracks. Most sites with engravings
        and/or cupules occur near water; for example at the site of Riverslee in the
        Tuli Block they encircle a waterhole while at Basinghall the cupule site is
        near the Limpopo River.

      body: Because the identity of the artists are unknown to us we can only speculate
        on the function and/or meanings of the art in relation to other rock art traditions
        in southern Africa.  These may include fertility, health, abundance, protection
        against evil spirits or summoning rain. Contemporary communities at Tsodilo
        Hills believe that spirits live in the Hills and have explained how those
        who enter the Hills must be respectful as the spirits are capable of both
        curing and punishing people. In particular, White Paintings Shelter in the
        Tsodilo Hills was used as a place to perform curative dances that involved
        the placing of hands on the paintings in order to use its power. Geometric
        designs are more difficult to interpret but may fit into a tradition of other
        geometric symbols in the region and represent weather and fertility symbols.
