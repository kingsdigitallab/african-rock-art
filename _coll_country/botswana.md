        the local Juc’hoansi  call them the “Copper Bracelet of the Evening”.'

      body: The paintings at Tsodilo are unique in comparison to other San&#124;Bushmen
        rock art in both techniques and subject matter. San&#124;Bushmen paintings
        are well-known throughout southern Africa for their fine-line detail because
        they were brush painted, but those at Tsodilo are finger painted. In addition,
        160 depictions of cattle are portrayed in the same style as wild animals,
        and more geometric designs appear here than anywhere else. Tsodilo animal
        drawings are larger and the geometric designs simpler than those found elsewhere.  In
        comparison to human figures elsewhere in southern Africa, those at Tsodilo
        appear without bows and arrows, clothing or any forms of personal ornamentation.  In
        addition, numerous cupules and grooves are incised and ground into rock surfaces,
        sometimes close to painted rock art sites and some on their own. For the residents
        of Tsodilo, the hills are a sacred place inhabited by spirits of the ancestors.

      body: While most of the images in the Tsodilo Hills seem to be discrete depictions,
        some sites show figures. Some of these figures are with cattle as well as
        women standing in rows in connection with animal groups, possibly showing
        some relationship with each other. Additionally, some of the rock art in the
        Tsodilo Hills shows superimposition, but this occurs infrequently. In some
        cases red geometric designs superimpose animals, but geometric designs and
        animals never superimpose human figures, nor do images of cattle ever superimpose
        other images – which may suggest some kind of relationship or hierarchy.

        antelope, snakes, unidentified animals and geometric designs, particularly
        “m” shapes. White paintings occur at sites with red paintings and often superimpose
        them.

      title: Cupules/Grooves
      title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 8'
      body: There are no engravings at Tsodilo representing animals or human figures,
        but more than 25 sites show evidence of small round depressions ground into
        the rock, known as cupules, as well as various shaped grooves that have been
        chipped and ground into the rock. The majority of sites are found on Female
        Hill, with four on Male Hill and one site on Child Hill. Cupules tend to measure
        about 5cm or more wide and less than a 1cm deep, although larger examples
        occur. They can occur at painted rock art sites but also on their own. For
        the most part they are found in groups ranging from 5 to 100 and in three
        cases, considerably more. For example, in Rhino Cave there are 346 carved
        into a vertical wall and nearly 1,100 at Depression Shelter. The purpose or
        meaning of cupules is unknown; they may have denoted a special place or the
        number of times a site had been visited. However, we have no dates for any
        of the cupules and even if they are adjacent to a rock art site, they are
        not necessarily contemporaneous. From their patina and general wear it has
        been proposed that some cupules may date back tens of thousands of years to
        the Middle Stone Age. If paintings also existed at this time they have long
        since disappeared.

        in other parts of southern Africa, nor the cruder style of white paintings
        attributed to later Bantu-speaking farmers.\n\nIt is possible that they were
        painted by the Khoesan during the first millennium AD, the original settlers
        in the area who made stone tools and herded livestock. A local Ncaekhoe man
        (a Central San people) claims his ancestors made the paintings and it is possible
        that some or many of the cattle images were painted by pastoral ancestors
        of Ncaekhoe. \n\nThe white paintings are more difficult to attribute authorship,
        although as they are comparable to the red paintings, comprising the same
        subject matter of elephant, rhino, giraffe and antelope as well as geometrics,
        they may reflect a later version of the red tradition.\n\n"

      body: The paintings at Tsodilo are often faded because they are located on rock
        faces exposed to the sun, wind and rain. As such, dating them scientifically
        is problematic as little or no suitable organic material remains. However,
        cattle paintings may help to date the art. There are about 160 depictions
        of cattle, which were common around the Tsodilo Hills between 800–1200 AD.
        As the cattle depictions are stylistically similar to other animal depictions
        it has been suggested that this seems to be a plausible date for most of the
        art (Coulson and Campbell, 2001:103)

        The southern African countries of Zimbabwe, South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, Botswana and Namibia contain thousands of rock art sites and southern African rock art has been studied extensively.  Due to perceived similarities in subject matter, even across great distances, much southern African rock art has been ascribed to hunter-gatherer painters and engravers who appear to have had a shared set of cultural references.  These have been linked with beliefs and practices which remain common to modern San&#124;Bushman¹ people, a number of traditional hunter-gatherer groups who continue to live in Southern Africa, principally in Namibia, Botswana and South Africa.  There are, however, differences in style and technique between regions, and various rock art traditions are attributed to other cultural groups and their ancestors.  As is often the case with rock art, the accurate attribution of authorship, date and motivation is difficult to establish, but the rock art of this region continues to be studied and the richness of the material in terms of subject matter, as well as in the context of the archaeological record, has much to tell us, both about its own provenance and the lives of the people who produced it.

      body: "Rock art of the type associated with hunter-gatherers is perhaps the
        most widely distributed rock art tradition in southern Africa, with numerous
        known examples in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe, but also with examples
        found in Botswana and Mozambique. This tradition comprises paintings and engravings,
        with both techniques featuring images of animals and people.  The type and
        composition varies from region to region.  For example, rock art sites of
        the southern Drakensberg and Maloti mountains in South Africa and Lesotho
        contain a higher proportion of images of eland antelope, while those in Namibia
        in turn feature more giraffes.  There are also regional variations in style
        and colour: in some sites and areas paintings are polychrome (multi-coloured)
        while in others they are not.\n\nDifferences also occur in composition between
        painting and engraving sites, with paintings more likely to feature multiple
        images on a single surface, often interacting with one another, while engraving
        sites more often include isolated images on individual rocks and boulders.
        \ However, there are commonalities in both imagery and style, with paintings
        throughout southern Africa often including depictions of people, particularly
        in procession and carrying items such as bows and arrows.  Also heavily featured
        in both paintings and engravings are animals, in particular large ungulates
        which are often naturalistically depicted, sometimes in great detail.  Additionally,
        images may include people and animals which appear to have the features of

      body: "Hunter-gatherer rock paintings are found in particular concentrations
        in the Drakensberg-Maloti and Cape Fold Mountains in South Africa and Lesotho,
        the Brandberg and Erongo Mountains in Namibia and the Matobo Hills in Zimbabwe,
        while engraving sites are found throughout the interior, often near water
        courses. \n\nA different form of rock painting from the hunter-gatherer type,
        found mainly in the north-eastern portion of southern Africa is that of the
        ‘late whites’.  Paintings in this tradition are so-called because they are
        usually associated with Bantu language-speaking Iron Age farming communities
        who entered the area from the north from around 2,000 years ago and many of
        these images are thought to have been painted later than some of the older
        hunter-gatherer paintings. ‘Late white’ paintings take many forms, but have
        generally been applied with a finger rather than a brush, and as the name
        suggests, are largely white in colour.  These images represent animals, people
        and geometric shapes, often in quite schematic forms, in contrast to the generally
        more naturalistic depictions of the hunter-gatherer art.  \n\nSometimes ‘late
        white’ art images relate to dateable events or depict objects and scenes which
        could only have taken place following European settlement, such as trains.
        \ Other forms of southern African rock art also depict European people and
        objects.  These include images from the Western Cape in South Africa of a
        sailing ship, estimated to date from after the mid-17th century, as well as
        painted and engraved imagery from throughout South Africa showing people on
        horseback with firearms. Such images are sometimes termed ‘contact art’ as
        their subject matter demonstrates that they follow the period of first contact
        between European and indigenous people.   \n"

        appear to come from the Bishop of Mozambique, who in 1721 reported sightings
        of paintings on rocks to the Royal Academy of History in Lisbon. Following
        this, reports, copies and publications of rock art from throughout modern
        South Africa were made with increasing frequency by officials and explorers.
        From the mid-19th century onwards, rock art from present-day Namibia, Zimbabwe
        and Botswana began to be documented, and during the first few decades of the
        twentieth century global public interest in the art was piqued by a series
        of illustrated publications. The hunter-gatherer rock art in particular had
        a strong aesthetic and academic appeal to western audiences, and reports,
        photographs and copied images attracted the attention of prominent figures
        in archaeology and ethnology such as Miles Burkitt, Leo Frobenius and the
        Abbé Breuil, researchers whose interest in rock art worldwide let them to
        visit and write about southern African rock art sites.  A further intensification
        of archaeological and anthropological research and recording in the 1950s-70s,
        resulted in new insights into the interpretations and attributions for southern
        African rock art. Rock art research continues throughout the area today.  '

      title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 8'
      body: Rather than showing scenes from daily life, as was once assumed, it is
        now usually accepted that hunter-gatherer art in southern Africa shows images
        and motifs of spiritual and cultural importance. In particular, it is thought
        that some images reflect trance visions of San&#124;Bushman spiritual leaders,
        or shamans,  during which they are considered to enter the world of spirits,
        where they are held to perform tasks for themselves and their communities,
        such as healing the sick or encouraging rain. This interpretation, which has
        been widely accepted, explains certain features of the art, for example the
        predominance of certain animals like eland antelope (due to their special
        cultural significance) and themes such as dot patterns and zigzag lines (interpreted
        as geometric patterns that shamans may see upon entering a trance state).

      title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 9'
      body: "The rock art attributed to ancestral San&#124;Bushman hunter-gatherers
        has many varied motifs, some of which may also relate to specific themes such
        as initiation or rainmaking (indeed within its cultural context one image
        may have several significances).  San&#124;Bushman informants in the 19th
        century told researchers that certain ambiguously shaped animals in the rock
        art repertoire represented animals related to water.  Images such as these
        are known to researchers as 'rain animals' and it has been suggested that
        certain images could reflect—or prompt—the shaman's attempt to control rainfall.
        Some 'late white' art has also been proposed to have associations with rainmaking
        practices, and indeed the proximity of some geometric rock art images, proposed
        to be of possible Khoekhoen origin, to watercourses appears to emphasise the
        practical and spiritual significance of water among historical southern African
        communities. It has also been proposed that some forms of geometric art attributed
        to Khoekhoen people may be linked by tradition and motif to the schematic
        art traditions of central Africa, themselves attributed to hunter-gatherers
        and possibly made in connection with beliefs about water and fertility.  Much
        in the “late white” corpus of paintings appears to be connected to initiation
        practices, part of a larger set of connected traditions extending north as
        far as Kenya.   \n\nThe long time periods, cultural connections, and movements
        involved can make attribution difficult.  For example, the idiosyncratic rock
        paintings of Tsodilo Hills in Botswana which appear to have similarities with
        the hunter-gatherer style include images of domesticates and may have been
        the work of herders.  More localised traditions, such as that of engravings
        in north-western South Africa representing the homesteads of ancestral Nguni
        or Sotho-Tswana language speakers, or the focus on engravings of animal tracks
        found in Namibia, demonstrate more specific regional significances.  Research
        continues and in recent decades, researchers, focusing on studying individual
        sites and sets of sites within the landscape and the local historical context,
        have discussed how their placement and subject matter may reflect the shifting
        balances of power, and changes in their communities over time.  \n"

      body: "Although dating rock art is always difficult, the study of rock art sites
        from southern Africa has benefitted from archaeological study and excavations
        at rock art sites have sometimes revealed useful information for ascribing
        dates.  Some of the oldest reliably dated examples of rock art in the world
        have been found in the region, with the most well-known examples probably
        being the painted plaques from Apollo 11 Cave in Namibia, dated to around
        30,000 years ago.  A portion of an engraved animal found in South Africa’s
        Northern Cape is estimated to be 10,200 years old and painted spalls from
        shelter walls in Zimbabwe have been dated to 12,000 years ago or older.  However,
        it is thought that the majority of existing rock art was made more recently.
        \ As ever, subject matter is also helpful in ascribing maximum date ranges.
        \ We know, for example,that images of domestic animals are probably less than
        2,000 years old.  The condition of the art may also help to establish relative
        ages, particularly with regards to engravings, which may be in some cases
        be categorised by the discolouration of the patina that darkens them over
        time.   \n\nThe multiplicity of rock art sites throughout southern Africa
        form a major component of southern Africa’s archaeological record, with many
        interesting clues about the lives of past inhabitants and, in some cases,
        continuing religious and cultural importance for contemporary communities.
        \ Many sites are open to the public, affording visitors the unique experience
        of viewing rock art in situ.  Unfortunately, the exposed nature of rock art
        in the field leaves it open to potential damage from the environment and vandalism.
        \ Many  major rock art sites in southern Africa are protected by law in their
        respective countries and the Maloti-Drakensberg Park in South Africa and Lesotho,
        Twyfelfontein/ǀUi-ǁAis in Namibia, Tsodilo Hills in Botswana and the Matobo

      body: The Republic of Botswana is bordered by South Africa to the south, Namibia
        to the west and north and Zimbabwe to the north-east. It shares a short border
        consisting of a few hundred metres with Zambia to the north. The majority
        of this flat country, around 70%, is made up of the Kalahari Desert, with
        the Okavango Delta, one of the world’s largest inland deltas located in the
        north. Botswana has a subtropical climate of hot summers and warm winters
        due to its high altitude and is semi-arid due to the short rainy season. Rock
        art is scattered across the country with the main sites being found in the
        Tsodilo Hills in the north- west;  the Gubatshaa Hills in the Chobe National
        Park, east of the Okavango Delta;  Tuli Block in the far east of the country
        and Manyana in the south-east.

        German geologist Siegfried Passarge visited the Tsodilo Hills on the 1st July 1898, mapping the area, writing on the geology and photographing a few rock paintings. In 1907, he published tracings of his photos in Die Buschmänner der Kalahari. A passing mention of the Hills was made in 1913 in a brief report by Max Happe, but it was François Balsan, a French industrialist and explorer, who raised the profile of Tsodilo Hills when over two days he photographed and prepared tracings of what has come to be known as the “Rhino Panel” on September 27-28 1951.

        Laurens van der Post’s publication of *The Lost World of the Kalahari* in 1958 brought Tsodilo Hills and its rock art to the attention of the wider world. Van der Post, an Afrikaner, had planned to make a film of the rock art in the region, but a number of events including the shooting of a steenbok (a severe crime locally), the cameras jamming and swarms of bees descending upon their camp, conspired against him and resulted in van der Post leaving the Hills in despair. However, he also left an apologetic note at the rock art panel he had been trying to film as a way of assuaging the wrath of the “Spirit of the Hills” as he put it. The rock face he was trying to film, comprising eland, giraffe and handprints, is now known as “Van der Post Panel”.

        In 1963 Alec Campbell visited the region with George Silberbauer, an ethnographer who had studied the San&#124;Bushmen in Botswana. As Director of Botswana’s National Museum, Campbell had a little government funding to record the rock art and excavate the rock shelters. Subsequently he collaborated with archaeologists Larry Robbins, Mike Murphy, and paleo-geographer George Brook.

        During the 1990s, Campbell, along with the staff from the National Museum recorded around 400 rock art sites numbering over 4,000 individual paintings. In 2001 Tsodilo Hills became a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its spiritual significance to local peoples, as well as its unique record of human settlement over many millennia.

        Tuli Block is a narrow fringe of land in the far east of the country that borders South Africa and lies on the banks of the Limpopo River. This area is characterised by rock engravings of human and animal footprints, and cupules, which hold spiritual importance both for San&#124;Bushman¹ hunter-gatherers and Tswana farmers. The engravings are thought to refer to a local myth that tells of an ancestor, named Matsieng, who is believed to have emerged from a waterhole followed by his animals. However, there are several localities in the region that claim this origin myth. It is thought the engravings in this area were created by the San&#124;Bushmen and linked to their belief system, appropriated later by the Tswana farmers.

        The most renowned rock art in Botswana comes from the Tsodilo Hills in the north-west of the country. With more than 4,500 paintings preserved in an area of 10km² it has been termed the “Louvre of the Desert”.  Tsodilo is made up of four main hills; Male Hill, Female Hill, Child Hill and North Hill, and paintings occur on all four. The subject matter, comprised of red and white paintings, includes animals, human figures and geometric designs. Red paintings are likely to have been made by San&#124;Bushmen, while the white paintings are more difficult to attribute authorship to but may be a later continuation of the red tradition. There are no engraved images at Tsodilo but cupules and ground grooves are a common feature.  Dating of the paintings at Tsodilo has been difficult, and because many of them occur on exposed surfaces where they are susceptible to damage by the sun, rain and wind, what remains is probably not very old. However, paintings of cattle, which are also badly faded, probably date to between AD 800 and 1150 when people kept these animals in this area.

        ¹ San&#124;Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

      body: 'Rock art is rare in the south-east of the country, but the site of Manyana
        is noteworthy because it is the only one that has been excavated. The paintings
        are found at five sites along a rock outcrop of 0.75 km at the base of the
        Koboleng Hills, and while once richly decorated, many of the paintings have
        now faded. It is difficult to determine exactly when the paintings were made,
        but excavation shows the use of ochre from the earliest occupation levels
        dating to the Late Stone Age, around AD 100 - 800, with the latest occupation
        levels dating to the Late Iron Age, around AD 1600-1700. Interestingly, none
        of the paintings were done in white, a colour found at many other sites in
        Botswana and other regions of southern Africa, and often attributed to paintings
        of Iron Age date. In addition, there are no images of eland or figures combining
        human/antelope form which are common occurrences in South African rock art. '

      body: Cupules and grooves can be found in the Tsodilo Hills, and also in the
        eastern part of the country in Tuli Block and Gubatshaa Hills. Engravings
        include human footprints and animal tracks. Most sites with engravings and/or
        cupules occur near water; for example at the site of Riverslee in the Tuli
        Block they encircle a waterhole while at Basinghall the cupule site is near
        the Limpopo River.

      body: Because the identity of the artists are unknown to us we can only speculate
        on the function and/or meanings of the art in relation to other rock art traditions
        in southern Africa.  These may include fertility, health, abundance, protection
        against evil spirits or summoning rain. Contemporary communities at Tsodilo
        Hills believe that spirits live in the Hills and have explained how those
        who enter the Hills must be respectful as the spirits are capable of both
        curing and punishing people. In particular, White Paintings Shelter in the
        Tsodilo Hills was used as a place to perform curative dances that involved
        the placing of hands on the paintings in order to use its power. Geometric
        designs are more difficult to interpret but may fit into a tradition of other
        geometric symbols in the region and represent weather and fertility symbols.
