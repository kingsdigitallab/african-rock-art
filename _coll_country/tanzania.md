      body: The Kondoa rock art sites are located on the eastern slopes of the Maasai
        escarpment, which borders the western side of the Great Rift Valley in central
        Tanzania, covering an area of over 2,336 km². Stretching for around 18 km
        along the escarpment, the exact number of rock art sites in the Kondoa area
        is unknown but is estimated to be up to 450, the oldest of which are thought
        be more than 2,000 years old. The extensive and spectacular collection of
        rock paintings are attributable to both hunter-gatherer and pastoralist communities
        and the images are testament to the changing socio-economic environment in
        the region. The hunter-gatherer rock paintings of Kondoa are dominated by
        human figures and animals. While a dark reddish brown predominates, other
        colours include yellow, orange, red and white.  Some of the shelters are still
        considered to have cultural associations with the people who live nearby,
        reflecting their beliefs, rituals and cosmological traditions. In 2006, Kondoa
        was nominated and listed as one of UNESCO’s World Heritage rock art sites
        in Africa.

      body: "The sites at Kolo are the most famous of the Kondoa paintings. Kolo comprises
        three rock art sites, known as Kolo 1, 2 and 3. The main site, Kolo 1 (known
        locally as Mongomi wa Kolo) is a large, imposing rock shelter that is only
        accessible by following a winding path at the end of a dirt road. This site
        contains many fine-line red paintings, some of which are very faded; but the
        site is still used by the local community for secret rituals. Kolo 2 is located
        south of the main site and includes human and animal figures, while Kolo 3
        is north of Kolo1 and is characterised by human, animal and geometric figures.
        The renowned palaeontologist Mary Leakey surveyed and documented many of the
        paintings at Kolo in the 1950s.  The examples we see here are thought to have
        been made by early hunter-gatherer groups, ancestors of the modern Sandawe,
        one of the first cultural groups to inhabit Kondoa.   \n\n"

        eland, rhinoceros and wildebeest; while human figures are represented as slender
        and elongated, often with elaborate hairstyles or headdresses, holding bows
        and arrows. Groups of figures are also shown bent at the waist, with some
        appearing to take on animal characteristics. These paintings have been associated
        with Sandawe cultural beliefs. \n\nThe Sandawe communicate with the spirits
        by taking on the power of an animal and some features at Mongomi wa Kolo can
        be understood by reference to the Sandawe traditional practice known as simbó
        (Ten Raa 1971, 1974). Developing Ten Raa’s observations, Lewis-Williams (1986)
        proposed that simbó is the ritual of being a lion, and that simbó dancers
        are believed to turn into lions. Lim (1992, 1996) adopted a site-specific
        approach to the rock art and has suggested that the importance of place is
        as important as the images themselves. According to Lim the potency of a place
        is produced through ritual activities, so that meaning resides in the process
        of painting in a particular location, rather than in the painted image itself.

        Ritual Practices

        Ritual sites are generally located near fig and baobab trees, and springs. However, about 3 m south of the main Kolo shelter, a cavity underneath a huge boulder is used, even today, by local diviners, healers and rainmakers to invoke visions and communicate with the spirits. Oral traditions indicate that Mongomi wa Kolo is considered more powerful than other ritual places in Kondoa, and its unusual location may contribute to its efficacy.  The other two shelters of Kolo 2 and 3 are also used for ritual ceremonies.

        __Conservation__

        When Mary Leakey was surveying the Kondoa rock paintings in 1983 she predicted that if serious preservation and conservation measures were not put in place the paintings would be destroyed by 2020. Although inscribed onto the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2006, it has been noted paintings are being destroyed by the dust from the ground and in some cases rainwater is causing the paintings to deteriorate.

        Moreover, the documentation of paintings at Kondoa is incomplete, and some areas have not been surveyed at all. Bwasiri (2008) advocates an urgent need to collate all existing information in this region and implement a sites and monuments record that also takes into account living heritage values.

      body: Containing some of the densest concentrations of rock art in East Africa,
        Tanzania includes many different styles and periods of rock art, the earliest
        of which may date back 10,000 years. Consisting mainly of paintings, rock
        art is found predominantly in the Kondoa region and the adjoining Lake Eyasi
        basin. Those at Kondoa were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2006,
        and were the first to be documented by missionaries in 1908.

      body: |-
        Situated within the Great Lakes Region of East Africa, Tanzania is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and the Indian Ocean to the east, with a coastline of approx. 800km. At 947,303 km², Tanzania is the largest country in East Africa and is home to Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro (5,895 m, 19,340 feet), located in the north-east of the country.

        Central Tanzania is comprised largely of a plateau, which is mainly grassland and contains many national parks. The north of the country is predominantly arable and includes the national capital of Dodoma. The north-east of the country is mountainous and contains the eastern arm of the Great Rift Valley. Further north-west is Lake Victoria adjoining the Kenya–Uganda–Tanzania border. Concentrations of rock art are found mainly in the Kondoa province of central Tanzania and also the Lake Eyasi Basin in the north of the country.


        The rock art of the Lake Eyasi Basin and that of Kondoa share many similarities related to subject matter, styles, pigments and even types of sites. This may possibly reflect a shared art tradition among hunter-gatherers, which is feasible as there are no natural barriers preventing the movement of cultural ideas and techniques.

      title_internal: Tanzania Chapter 3
      body: 'The existence of painted rock art was first reported  to Europeans in
        1908 by missionaries, but the first scientific explorations date back to the
        1930s. Early surveys were undertaken by Ludwig Kohl-Larsen (1958), a German
        physician, amateur anthropologist and explorer, who traced images in more
        than 70 rock shelters in 1935. The renowned paleoanthropologists Mary and
        Louis Leakey (1983) were the first to extensively study the rock art of Tanzania
        during the 1930s and 1950s (having noted many sites in the 1920s), documenting
        over 1600 painted images at 186 sites north of Kondoa. In the late 1970s and
        during the 1980s Fidelis Masao (1979) surveyed 68 rock paintings sites and
        excavated four of them while Emmanuel Anati (1996) recorded 200 sites in Kondoa.
        Other researchers include Eric ten Raa (1971, 1974), David Lewis-Williams
        (1986), Imogene Lim (1992), and Emmanuel Bwasiri (2008, 2011); all of whom
        have recorded numerous sites, contributing to identifying chronologies, styles
        and possible interpretations. Conservation and preservation of the rock art
        has been of importance since the 1930s, and many of the paintings recorded
        by the Leakeys in the early 1950s are now severely deteriorated, or in some
        cases completely destroyed. '

      title_internal: Tanzania Chapter 4
      body: "Scholars have classified the rock art in Tanzania into three main stylistic
        groups:  Hunter-gatherer, also known as Sandawe, Pastoral, and Late Whites.
        Hunter-gatherer and Late White paintings are often found in the same rock
        shelters and in some instances, all three types occur at the same site. \n\nNo
        paintings have been scientifically dated, but some researchers have proposed
        the earliest dates for the art: Anati (1996) has suggested paintings at Kondoa
        may be up to 40,000 years old; Leakey (1985) and Coulson and Campbell (2001)
        up to 10,000 years old. Masao (1979) has estimated the earliest art at perhaps
        3000 years old. These are estimates and not based on radiometric dating techniques,
        and as the paintings have been exposed to considerable weathering these very
        early dates currently cannot be substantiated.\n\n__Hunter-gatherer__\n\nHunter-gatherer
        or Sandawe rock art is characterised by fine-line paintings and includes images
        of animals, human figures, handprints and circular designs. These are the
        earliest paintings, thought to date to between 3,000-10,000 years ago, and
        are attributed to the ancestral Sandawe, a hunter-gatherer group indigenous
        to north-east Tanzania. \n\nThis tradition of rock art occurs in the Kondoa
        region, with just a few hundred sites in a concentration of less than a 100km
        in diameter and corresponding closely to the known distribution of the Sandawe
        people. Animals, such as giraffe, elephant, rhinoceros, antelope, plus a few
        birds and reptiles, dogs and possibly bees, make up more than half of the
        images depicted. In addition there are a few animal tracks depicted: cloven
        hooves, porcupine and aardvark.  \n"

        Typically, human figures are slender and elongated, wearing large elaborate coiffures or headdresses, and sometimes with animal heads.  Occasionally they are bent at the waist but they always appear in groups or pairs. A few of the figures are painted with bows and arrows and occur with animals, although whether these represent a hunting scene is uncertain. Women are very scarce. The few handprints present are painted depictions rather than stencils and circular designs are made up of concentric circles sometimes with elaborate rays and occasional rectangles and finger dots.

        __Pastoral__

        About 3,000 years ago, Cushitic herders from Ethiopia moved into the region, and were followed by Nilotic cattle pastoralists, ancestors of today’s Maasai. In comparison to hunter-gatherer rock art, Pastoral rock art yields many fewer paintings and generally depicts cattle in profile, and sometimes sheep and/or goats, a few dogs and figures holding sticks and bows. Predominantly painted in black and sometimes red and white, the colour of many images has now faded to a dull grey colour.

        __Late White__

        Late White paintings are crude, finger painted images and often superimpose older images. These were made by Bantu-speaking, iron-working farmers who moved into the region in the last 300-500 years.  The most common type of depiction are designs and motifs that include circles, some of which have rays emanating outwards,  concentric circles, patterns of dots and grids with outlines, what look like stick figures with multiple arms, as well as handprints. Animal depictions include giraffe, elephant, antelope, snakes, reptiles, baboons and domestic species. Human figures are less common, but when present are notably men facing forwards with hands on hips, sometimes holding weapons.
