      body: The Kondoa rock art sites are located on the eastern slopes of the Maasai
        escarpment, which borders the western side of the Great Rift Valley in central
        Tanzania, covering an area of over 2,336 km². Stretching for around 18 km
        along the escarpment, the exact number of rock art sites in the Kondoa area
        is unknown but is estimated to be up to 450, the oldest of which are thought
        be more than 2,000 years old. The extensive and spectacular collection of
        rock paintings are attributable to both hunter-gatherer and pastoralist communities
        and the images are testament to the changing socio-economic environment in
        the region. The hunter-gatherer rock paintings of Kondoa are dominated by
        human figures and animals. While a dark reddish brown predominates, other
        colours include yellow, orange, red and white.  Some of the shelters are still
        considered to have cultural associations with the people who live nearby,
        reflecting their beliefs, rituals and cosmological traditions. In 2006, Kondoa
        was nominated and listed as one of UNESCO’s World Heritage rock art sites
        in Africa.

      body: "The sites at Kolo are the most famous of the Kondoa paintings. Kolo comprises
        three rock art sites, known as Kolo 1, 2 and 3. The main site, Kolo 1 (known
        locally as Mongomi wa Kolo) is a large, imposing rock shelter that is only
        accessible by following a winding path at the end of a dirt road. This site
        contains many fine-line red paintings, some of which are very faded; but the
        site is still used by the local community for secret rituals. Kolo 2 is located
        south of the main site and includes human and animal figures, while Kolo 3
        is north of Kolo1 and is characterised by human, animal and geometric figures.
        The renowned palaeontologist Mary Leakey surveyed and documented many of the
        paintings at Kolo in the 1950s.  The examples we see here are thought to have
        been made by early hunter-gatherer groups, ancestors of the modern Sandawe,
        one of the first cultural groups to inhabit Kondoa.   \n\n"

        eland, rhinoceros and wildebeest; while human figures are represented as slender
        and elongated, often with elaborate hairstyles or headdresses, holding bows
        and arrows. Groups of figures are also shown bent at the waist, with some
        appearing to take on animal characteristics. These paintings have been associated
        with Sandawe cultural beliefs. \n\nThe Sandawe communicate with the spirits
        by taking on the power of an animal and some features at Mongomi wa Kolo can
        be understood by reference to the Sandawe traditional practice known as simbó
        (Ten Raa 1971, 1974). Developing Ten Raa’s observations, Lewis-Williams (1986)
        proposed that simbó is the ritual of being a lion, and that simbó dancers
        are believed to turn into lions. Lim (1992, 1996) adopted a site-specific
        approach to the rock art and has suggested that the importance of place is
        as important as the images themselves. According to Lim the potency of a place
        is produced through ritual activities, so that meaning resides in the process
        of painting in a particular location, rather than in the painted image itself.

        Ritual Practices

        Ritual sites are generally located near fig and baobab trees, and springs. However, about 3 m south of the main Kolo shelter, a cavity underneath a huge boulder is used, even today, by local diviners, healers and rainmakers to invoke visions and communicate with the spirits. Oral traditions indicate that Mongomi wa Kolo is considered more powerful than other ritual places in Kondoa, and its unusual location may contribute to its efficacy.  The other two shelters of Kolo 2 and 3 are also used for ritual ceremonies.

        __Conservation__

        When Mary Leakey was surveying the Kondoa rock paintings in 1983 she predicted that if serious preservation and conservation measures were not put in place the paintings would be destroyed by 2020. Although inscribed onto the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2006, it has been noted paintings are being destroyed by the dust from the ground and in some cases rainwater is causing the paintings to deteriorate.

        Moreover, the documentation of paintings at Kondoa is incomplete, and some areas have not been surveyed at all. Bwasiri (2008) advocates an urgent need to collate all existing information in this region and implement a sites and monuments record that also takes into account living heritage values.

        The rock art of eastern Africa is characterised by a wide range of non-figurative images, broadly defined as geometric. Occurring in a number of different patterns or designs, they are thought to have been in existence in this region for thousands of years, although often it is difficult to attribute the art to particular cultural groups. Geometric rock art is difficult to interpret, and designs have been variously associated with sympathetic magic, symbols of climate or fertility and altered states of consciousness (Coulson and Campbell, 2010:220). However, in some cases the motifs painted or engraved on the rock face resemble the same designs used for branding livestock and are intimately related to people’s lives and world views in this region.

        First observed in Kenya in the 1970s with the work of Gramly (1975) at Lukenya Hill and Lynch and Robbins (1977) at Namoratung’a, some geometric motifs seen in the rock art of the region were observed to have had their counterparts on the hides of cattle of local communities. Although cattle branding is known to be  practised by several Kenyan groups, Gramly concluded that  “drawing cattle brands on the walls of rock shelters appears to be confined to the regions formerly inhabited by the Maa-speaking pastoralists or presently occupied by them”&dagger;(Gramly, 1977:117).

      body: In the case of Lukenya Hill, the rock shelters on whose walls these geometric
        symbols occur are associated with meat-feasting ceremonies. Meat-feasting
        shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are
        places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat
        in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle.
        During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were
        painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand
        their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners,
        but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease.
        Different symbols may be used for male and female animals.

        of geometric motifs. Some of these motifs bear a striking resemblance to the
        brand marks that the Turkana mark on their cattle, camels, donkeys and other
        livestock in the area, although local people claim no authorship for the funerary
        engravings (Russell, 2013:4).

      body: Recent research (Russell, 2013) has shown that at Namoratung’a the branding
        of animals signifies a sense of belonging rather than a mark of ownership
        as we understand it in a modern farming context; all livestock, cattle, camel,
        goats, sheep and donkeys are branded according to species and sex (Russell,
        2013:7). Ethnographic accounts document that clan membership can only be determined
        by observing someone with their livestock (Russell, 2013:9). The symbol itself
        is not as important as the act of placing it on the animal’s skin, and local
        people have confirmed that they never mark rock with brand marks. Thus, the
        geometric motifs on the grave markers may have been borrowed by local Turkana
        to serve as identity markers, but in a different context. In the Horn of Africa,
        some geometric rock art is located in the open landscape and on graves. It
        has been suggested that these too are brand or clan marks, possibly made by
        camel keeping pastoralists to mark achievement, territory or ownership (Russell,
        2013:18). Some nomadic pastoralists, further afield, such as the Tuareg, place
        their clan marks along the routes they travel, carved onto salt blocks, trees
        and wells (Mohamed, 1990; Landais, 2001).

      body: "However, not all pastoralist geometric motifs can be associated with
        meat-feasting or livestock branding; they may have wider symbolism or be symbolic
        of something else (Russell, 2013:17).  For example, informants from the Samburu
        people reported that while some of the painted motifs found at Samburu meat-feasting
        shelters were of cattle brands, others represented female headdresses or were
        made to mark an initiation, and in some Masai shelters there are also clear
        representations of warriors’ shields.  In Uganda, a ceremonial rock in Karamoja,
        shows a dung painting consisting of large circles bisected by a cross which
        is said to represent cattle enclosures (Robbins, 1972). Geometric symbols,
        painted in fat and red ochre, on large phallic-shaped fertility stones on
        the Mesakin and Korongo Hills in south Sudan indicate the sex of the child
        to whom prayers are offered (Bell, 1936). A circle bisected by a line or circles
        bisected by two crosses represent boys. Girls are represented by a cross (drawn
        diagonally) or a slanting line (like a forward slash)(Russell, 2013: 17).\n\nAlthough
        pastoralist geometric motifs are widespread in the rock art of eastern Africa,
        attempting to find the meaning behind geometric designs is problematic. The
        examples discussed here demonstrate that motifs can have multiple authors,
        even in the same location, and that identical symbols can be the products
        of very different behaviours. \n"

        Central Africa is dominated by vast river systems and lakes, particularly the Congo River Basin. Characterised by hot and wet weather on both sides of the equator, central Africa has no regular dry season, but aridity increases in intensity both north and south of the equator. Covered with a forest of about 400,000 m² (1,035,920 km²), it is one of the greenest parts of the continent.  The rock art of central Africa stretches from the Zambezi River to the Angolan Atlantic coast and reaches as far north as Cameroon and Uganda. Termed the ‘schematic rock art zone’ by Desmond Clark (1959), it is dominated by finger-painted geometric motifs and designs, thought to extend back many thousands of years.

        Eastern Africa, from the Zambezi River Valley to Lake Turkana, consists largely of a vast inland plateau with the highest elevations on the continent, such as Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m above sea level) and Mount Kenya (5,199 m above sea level). Twin parallel rift valleys run through the region, which includes the world’s second largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria. The climate is atypical of an equatorial region, being cool and dry due to the high altitude and monsoon winds created by the Ethiopian Highlands. The rock art of eastern Africa is concentrated on this plateau and consists mainly of paintings that include animal and human representations. Found mostly in central Tanzania, eastern Zambia and Malawi; in comparison to the widespread distribution of geometric rock art, this figurative tradition is much more localised, and found at just a few hundred sites in a region of less than 100km in diameter.

        The rock art of East Africa, in particular the red paintings from Tanzania, was extensively studied by Mary and Louis Leakey in the 1930s and 1950s. Eric Ten Raa observed Sandawe people of Tanzania making rock paintings in the mid-20th century, and on the basis of oral traditions argued that the rock art was made for three main purposes: casual art; magic art (for hunting purposes or connected to health and fertility) and sacrificial art (to appease ancestral spirits). Subsequently, during the 1970s Fidelis Masao and Emmanuel Anati recorded numerous sites, classifying the art in broad chronological and stylistic categories, proposing tentative interpretations with regard to meaning.

        There has much debate and uncertainty about Central African rock art.  The history of the region has seen much mobility and interaction of cultural groups and understanding how the rock art relates to particular groups has been problematic. Pioneering work in this region was undertaken by Margaret Metcalfe in central Malawi in the early 1920s, Clarence van Riet Lowe visited Zambia in 1936 and attempted to provide a chronological sequence and some insight into the meaning of the rock art. Since the 1950s (Clarke, 1959), archaeologists have attempted to situate rock art within broader archaeological frameworks in order to resolve chronologies, and to categorise the art with reference to style, colour, superimposition, subject matter, weathering, and positioning of depictions within the panel (Phillipson, 1976). Building on this work, our current understanding of rock in this region has been advanced by Benjamin Smith (1995, 1997, 2001) with his work in Zambia and Malawi.

      body: "Rock art of East Africa consists mainly of paintings, most of which are
        found in central Tanzania, and are fewer in number in eastern Zambia and Malawi;
        scholars have categorised them as follows:\n\n*__Red Paintings__*:  \nRed
        paintings can be sub-divided into those found in central Tanzania and those
        found stretching from Zambia to the Indian Ocean.\nTanzanian red paintings
        include large, naturalistic animals with occasional geometric motifs. The
        giraffe is the most frequently painted animal, but antelope, zebra, elephant,
        rhino, felines and ostrich are also depicted. Later images show figures with
        highly distinctive stylised human head forms or hairstyles and body decoration,
        sometimes in apparent hunting and domestic scenes. The Sandawe and Hadza,
        hunter-gatherer groups, indigenous to north-central and central Tanzania respectively,
        claim their ancestors were responsible for some of the later art.\n\nThe area
        in which Sandawe rock art is found is less than 100km in diameter and occurs
        at just a few hundred sites, but corresponds closely to the known distribution
        of this group. There have been some suggestions that Sandawe were making rock
        art early into the 20th century, linking the art to particular rituals, in
        particular simbo; a trance dance in which the Sandawe communicate with the
        spirit world by taking on the power of an animal. The art displays a range
        of motifs and postures, features that can be understood by reference to simbo
        and to trance experiences; such as groups of human figures bending at the
        waist (which occurs during the *simbo* dance), taking on animal features such
        as ears and tails, and floating or flying; reflecting the experiences of those
        possessed in the dance."

      body: "Zambian rock art does not share any similarities with Tanzanian rock
        art and can be divided into two categories; animals (with a few depictions
        of humans), and geometric motifs. Animals are often highly stylised and superimposed
        with rows of dots. Geometric designs include, circles, some of which have
        radiating lines, concentric circles, parallel lines and ladder shapes. Predominantly
        painted in red, the remains of white pigment is still often visible. David
        Phillipson (1976) proposed that the naturalistic animals were earlier in date
        than geometric designs. Building on Phillipson’s work, Benjamin Smith studied
        ethnographic records and demonstrated that geometric motifs were made by women
        or controlling the weather.\n\n*__Pastoralist paintings__*: \nPastoralist
        paintings are rare, with only a few known sites in Kenya and other possible
        sites in Malawi. Usually painted in black, white and grey, but also in other
        colours, they include small outlines, often infilled, of cattle and are occasional
        accompanied by geometric motifs. Made during the period from 3,200 to 1,800
        years ago the practice ceased after Bantu language speaking people had settled
        in eastern Africa. Similar paintings are found in Ethiopia but not in southern
        Africa, and it has been assumed that these were made by Cushitic or Nilotic
        speaking groups, but their precise attribution remains unclear (Smith, 2013:154).\n"

        *__Late White Paintings__*:
        Commonly painted in white, or off-white with the fingers, so-called ‘Late White’ depictions include quite large crudely rendered representations of wild animals, mythical animals, human figures and numerous geometric motifs. These paintings are attributed to Bantu language speaking, iron-working farmers who entered eastern Africa about 2,000 years ago from the west on the border of Nigeria and Cameroon. Moving through areas occupied by the Batwa it is thought they learned the use of symbols painted on rock, skin, bark cloth and in sand. Chewa peoples, Bantu language speakers who live in modern day Zambia and Malawi claim their ancestors made many of the more recent paintings which they used in rites of passage ceremonies.

        *__Meat-feasting paintings__*:
        Meat-feasting shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle. The term Maa relates to a group of closely related Eastern Nilotic languages, which historically dominated the east African hinterland; and today is spoken by around a million people. During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners, but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease. Different symbols may be used for male and female animals. Over the centuries, because the depictions are on the ceiling of meat feasting rock shelters, and because sites are used even today, a build-up of soot has obscured or obliterated the paintings. Unfortunately, few have been recorded or mapped.

      body: The rock art of central Africa is attributed to hunter-gatherers known
        as Batwa. This term is used widely in eastern central and southern Africa
        to denote any autochthonous hunter-gatherer people. The rock art of the Batwa
        can be divided into two categories which are quite distinctive stylistically
        from the Tanzanian depictions of the Sandawe and Hadza. Nearly 3,000 sites
        are currently known from within this area. The vast majority, around 90%,
        consist of finger-painted geometric designs; the remaining 10% include highly
        stylised animal forms (with a few human figures) and rows of finger dots.
        Both types are thought to date back many thousands of years. The two traditions
        co-occur over a vast area of eastern and central Africa and while often found
        in close proximity to each other are only found together at a few sites. However,
        it is the dominance of geometric motifs that make this rock art tradition
        very distinctive from other regions in Africa.

      body: "The Horn of Africa has historically been a crossroads area between the
        Eastern Sahara, the Subtropical regions to the South and the Arabic Peninsula.
        These mixed influences can be seen in many archaeological and historical features
        throughout the region, the rock art being no exception. Since the early stages
        of research in the 1930s, a strong relationship between the rock art in Ethiopia
        and the Arabian Peninsula was detected, leading to the establishment of the
        term *Ethiopian-Arabian* rock art by Pavel Červiček in 1971. This research
        thread proposes a progressive evolution from naturalism to schematism, ranging
        from the 4th-3rd millennium BC to the near past. Although the *Ethiopian-Arabian*
        proposal is still widely accepted and stylistic similarities between the rock
        art of Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen or Saudi Arabia are undeniable, recent voices
        have been raised against the term because of its excessive generalisation
        and lack of operability. In addition, recent research to the south of Ethiopia
        have started to discover new rock art sites related to those found in Uganda
        and Kenya.\n\nRegarding the main themes of the Horn of Africa rock art, cattle
        depictions seem to have been paramount, with cows and bulls depicted either
        isolated or in herds, frequently associated with ritual scenes which show
        their importance in these communities. Other animals – zebus, camels, felines,
        dogs, etc. –  are also represented, as well as rows of human figures, and
        fighting scenes between warriors or against lions. Geometric symbols are also
        common, usually associated with other depictions; and in some places they
        have been interpreted as tribal or clan marks. Both engraving and painting
        is common in most regions, with many regional variations. \n"

        Rock art in the Horn of Africa faces several challenges. One of them is the lack of consolidated chronologies and absolute dating for the paintings and engravings. Another is the uneven knowledge of rock art throughout the region, with research often affected by political unrest. Therefore, distributions of rock art in the region are steadily growing as research is undertaken in one of the most interactive areas in East Africa.

        The rock art of Central and East Africa is one of the least documented and well understood of the corpus of African rock art. However, in recent years scholars have undertaken some comprehensive reviews of existing sites and surveys of new sites to open up the debates and more fully understand the complexities of this region.

      body: |-
        Situated within the Great Lakes Region of East Africa, Tanzania is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and the Indian Ocean to the east, with a coastline of approx. 800km. At 947,303 km², Tanzania is the largest country in East Africa and is home to Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro (5,895 m, 19,340 feet), located in the north-east of the country.

        Central Tanzania is comprised largely of a plateau, which is mainly grassland and contains many national parks. The north of the country is predominantly arable and includes the national capital of Dodoma. The north-east of the country is mountainous and contains the eastern arm of the Great Rift Valley. Further north-west is Lake Victoria adjoining the Kenya–Uganda–Tanzania border. Concentrations of rock art are found mainly in the Kondoa province of central Tanzania and also the Lake Eyasi Basin in the north of the country.


        The rock art of the Lake Eyasi Basin and that of Kondoa share many similarities related to subject matter, styles, pigments and even types of sites. This may possibly reflect a shared art tradition among hunter-gatherers, which is feasible as there are no natural barriers preventing the movement of cultural ideas and techniques.

      body: 'The existence of painted rock art was first reported  to Europeans in
        1908 by missionaries, but the first scientific explorations date back to the
        1930s. Early surveys were undertaken by Ludwig Kohl-Larsen (1958), a German
        physician, amateur anthropologist and explorer, who traced images in more
        than 70 rock shelters in 1935. The renowned paleoanthropologists Mary and
        Louis Leakey (1983) were the first to extensively study the rock art of Tanzania
        during the 1930s and 1950s (having noted many sites in the 1920s), documenting
        over 1600 painted images at 186 sites north of Kondoa. In the late 1970s and
        during the 1980s Fidelis Masao (1979) surveyed 68 rock paintings sites and
        excavated four of them while Emmanuel Anati (1996) recorded 200 sites in Kondoa.
        Other researchers include Eric ten Raa (1971, 1974), David Lewis-Williams
        (1986), Imogene Lim (1992), and Emmanuel Bwasiri (2008, 2011); all of whom
        have recorded numerous sites, contributing to identifying chronologies, styles
        and possible interpretations. Conservation and preservation of the rock art
        has been of importance since the 1930s, and many of the paintings recorded
        by the Leakeys in the early 1950s are now severely deteriorated, or in some
        cases completely destroyed. '

      body: "Scholars have classified the rock art in Tanzania into three main stylistic
        groups:  Hunter-gatherer, also known as Sandawe, Pastoral, and Late Whites.
        Hunter-gatherer and Late White paintings are often found in the same rock
        shelters and in some instances, all three types occur at the same site. \n\nNo
        paintings have been scientifically dated, but some researchers have proposed
        the earliest dates for the art: Anati (1996) has suggested paintings at Kondoa
        may be up to 40,000 years old; Leakey (1985) and Coulson and Campbell (2001)
        up to 10,000 years old. Masao (1979) has estimated the earliest art at perhaps
        3000 years old. These are estimates and not based on radiometric dating techniques,
        and as the paintings have been exposed to considerable weathering these very
        early dates currently cannot be substantiated.\n\n__Hunter-gatherer__\n\nHunter-gatherer
        or Sandawe rock art is characterised by fine-line paintings and includes images
        of animals, human figures, handprints and circular designs. These are the
        earliest paintings, thought to date to between 3,000-10,000 years ago, and
        are attributed to the ancestral Sandawe, a hunter-gatherer group indigenous
        to north-east Tanzania. \n\nThis tradition of rock art occurs in the Kondoa
        region, with just a few hundred sites in a concentration of less than a 100km
        in diameter and corresponding closely to the known distribution of the Sandawe
        people. Animals, such as giraffe, elephant, rhinoceros, antelope, plus a few
        birds and reptiles, dogs and possibly bees, make up more than half of the
        images depicted. In addition there are a few animal tracks depicted: cloven
        hooves, porcupine and aardvark.  \n"

        Typically, human figures are slender and elongated, wearing large elaborate coiffures or headdresses, and sometimes with animal heads.  Occasionally they are bent at the waist but they always appear in groups or pairs. A few of the figures are painted with bows and arrows and occur with animals, although whether these represent a hunting scene is uncertain. Women are very scarce. The few handprints present are painted depictions rather than stencils and circular designs are made up of concentric circles sometimes with elaborate rays and occasional rectangles and finger dots.

        __Pastoral__

        About 3,000 years ago, Cushitic herders from Ethiopia moved into the region, and were followed by Nilotic cattle pastoralists, ancestors of today’s Maasai. In comparison to hunter-gatherer rock art, Pastoral rock art yields many fewer paintings and generally depicts cattle in profile, and sometimes sheep and/or goats, a few dogs and figures holding sticks and bows. Predominantly painted in black and sometimes red and white, the colour of many images has now faded to a dull grey colour.

        __Late White__

        Late White paintings are crude, finger painted images and often superimpose older images. These were made by Bantu-speaking, iron-working farmers who moved into the region in the last 300-500 years.  The most common type of depiction are designs and motifs that include circles, some of which have rays emanating outwards,  concentric circles, patterns of dots and grids with outlines, what look like stick figures with multiple arms, as well as handprints. Animal depictions include giraffe, elephant, antelope, snakes, reptiles, baboons and domestic species. Human figures are less common, but when present are notably men facing forwards with hands on hips, sometimes holding weapons.
