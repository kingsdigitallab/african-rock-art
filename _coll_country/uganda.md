        First documented in 1913 (in the Teso Report&dagger;), the geometric paintings at Nyero are among the most important and well documented rock art sites in Uganda, and are on the Tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage sites&Dagger;.

        Nyero is located in eastern Uganda in the Kumi District, about 200 km from the capital city Kampala.  It comprises six rock shelters in total, but initially only three were recorded and referred to as shrines by local communities, who had no knowledge of the origins of the paintings. The authorship of the paintings remains in some debate.

        Initially, the rock art was thought to be the work of San&#124;Bushmen of southern Africa. However, archaeological, genetic and ethnographic evidence has subsequently attributed the paintings to the ancestors of Batwa people, hunter-gatherers who are descendants of ancient aboriginal groups once spread across East and Central Africa and most probably the original inhabitants of this landscape. Today they live in small groups near the Rwanda/Uganda border.

        More recent studies have proposed that the rock art was the work of settled human groups and not early hunter-gatherers. It has been proposed that rock shelters were used by semi-nomadic peoples devoted to animal herding, and used as reference points in the landscape. Generally positioned away from flat land, they may have served to direct herders of cattle and/or goats towards paths and water. The unknown identity of the rock artists makes dating problematic, but some of the paintings may be up to 12,000 years old.
        Notwithstanding the problems associated with attribution and chronology, many of the rock paintings in Uganda show serious damage due to long exposure to the elements. At Nyero 2, the paintings are partially covered with mineral salts, while at Nyero 5 the paintings have been destroyed or are obscured by rain wash-off. The physical condition of the paintings is testament to their antiquity.

        __Nyero Rock Art sites:__

        __Nyero 1__
        This is a small rock shelter on the outer edge of the outcrop and comprises six sets of concentric circles with a central image of a ‘floral motif’ and a so-called ‘acacia pod’ shape. The geometrics in this shelter are all painted in white.

        __Nyero 2__
        This is the main shelter, the overhang of which is formed by an enormous boulder (estimated to weigh at least 20,000 tons) which has broken away; a vertical rock against the back wall measures 10m in height. The panel at Nyero 2 consists of more than forty images such as vertical divided sausage shapes, so-called ‘canoes‘, unidentified faint markings, ‘U’ shapes, lines and dots, with evidence of superimposition; but is dominated by concentric circles. A unique feature of the paintings are the so-called ‘canoes’ or parts of ‘canoes’, so-called because of their resemblance in form. The depictions are all painted in shades of red.

        The paintings are protected from direct rain by the overhang and rocks to the front and sides protect the paintings from the sun, which is likely to have contributed to their preservation. Early users of the shelter placed ritual gifts on its south-eastern side; the tradition of using this space to place money either before or after receiving help from ancestral spirits is continued by the local community.
        As well as the rock art, a bone incised with three concentric circles and four parallel lines, and pieces of prepared ochre were excavated from this site in 1945.  These are the only evidence of prehistoric portable art so far found in Uganda.

        __Nyero 3__
        Located about eight minutes’ walk from Nyero 2, this shelter is formed by a large boulder perched on supporting rocks. Paintings consist of white concentric circles; the outer circles surrounded by double curved designs, between which are double lines divided into small compartments.

        This is a small shelter on the south-western side of the hill where there are a few traces of red finger-painted concentric circles, two conical shapes and lines.

        __Nyero 5__
        Situated on the western side of the hill, this shelter has a red geometric motif composed of a combination of circular and linear shapes made with both a brush and a finger. However, the images are quite difficult to distinguish as they are damaged by natural water erosion.

        __Nyero 6__
        Situated on the top of the hill, this shelter has a good view of the landscape. This site features two red finger-painted outlines of small oval shapes and a slanting L-shape as well as an outlined cross with a small circle below. The painted surface is now subject to severe exfoliation as it is open to the rain and morning sun.

        The sites at Nyero are believed locally to have been sacred ancestral places where, in the past, people would have travelled long distances to make offerings of food, beer and money in times of drought, misfortune and for child birth. Nyero was also regarded as a magical place where rain ceremonies were held. Oral histories have recorded strong attachments to the site and individual and community prayers were held seasonally. The antiquity of the images and their association with long-forgotten peoples may serve to enhance Nyero as a special and sacred place for local communities.

        The rock art of eastern Africa is characterised by a wide range of non-figurative images, broadly defined as geometric. Occurring in a number of different patterns or designs, they are thought to have been in existence in this region for thousands of years, although often it is difficult to attribute the art to particular cultural groups. Geometric rock art is difficult to interpret, and designs have been variously associated with sympathetic magic, symbols of climate or fertility and altered states of consciousness (Coulson and Campbell, 2010:220). However, in some cases the motifs painted or engraved on the rock face resemble the same designs used for branding livestock and are intimately related to people’s lives and world views in this region.

        First observed in Kenya in the 1970s with the work of Gramly (1975) at Lukenya Hill and Lynch and Robbins (1977) at Namoratung’a, some geometric motifs seen in the rock art of the region were observed to have had their counterparts on the hides of cattle of local communities. Although cattle branding is known to be  practised by several Kenyan groups, Gramly concluded that  “drawing cattle brands on the walls of rock shelters appears to be confined to the regions formerly inhabited by the Maa-speaking pastoralists or presently occupied by them”&dagger;(Gramly, 1977:117).

      body: In the case of Lukenya Hill, the rock shelters on whose walls these geometric
        symbols occur are associated with meat-feasting ceremonies. Meat-feasting
        shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are
        places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat
        in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle.
        During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were
        painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand
        their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners,
        but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease.
        Different symbols may be used for male and female animals.

        similar visible relationship. The southernmost site is well known for its
        167 megalithic stones marking male burials on which are engraved hundreds
        of geometric motifs. Some of these motifs bear a striking resemblance to the
        brand marks that the Turkana mark on their cattle, camels, donkeys and other
        livestock in the area, although local people claim no authorship for the funerary
        engravings (Russell, 2013:4).

      body: Recent research (Russell, 2013) has shown that at Namoratung’a the branding
        of animals signifies a sense of belonging rather than a mark of ownership
        as we understand it in a modern farming context; all livestock, cattle, camel,
        goats, sheep and donkeys are branded according to species and sex (Russell,
        2013:7). Ethnographic accounts document that clan membership can only be determined
        by observing someone with their livestock (Russell, 2013:9). The symbol itself
        is not as important as the act of placing it on the animal’s skin, and local
        people have confirmed that they never mark rock with brand marks. Thus, the
        geometric motifs on the grave markers may have been borrowed by local Turkana
        to serve as identity markers, but in a different context. In the Horn of Africa,
        some geometric rock art is located in the open landscape and on graves. It
        has been suggested that these too are brand or clan marks, possibly made by
        camel keeping pastoralists to mark achievement, territory or ownership (Russell,
        2013:18). Some nomadic pastoralists, further afield, such as the Tuareg, place
        their clan marks along the routes they travel, carved onto salt blocks, trees
        and wells (Mohamed, 1990; Landais, 2001).

      body: "However, not all pastoralist geometric motifs can be associated with
        meat-feasting or livestock branding; they may have wider symbolism or be symbolic
        of something else (Russell, 2013:17).  For example, informants from the Samburu
        people reported that while some of the painted motifs found at Samburu meat-feasting
        shelters were of cattle brands, others represented female headdresses or were
        made to mark an initiation, and in some Masai shelters there are also clear
        representations of warriors’ shields.  In Uganda, a ceremonial rock in Karamoja,
        shows a dung painting consisting of large circles bisected by a cross which
        is said to represent cattle enclosures (Robbins, 1972). Geometric symbols,
        painted in fat and red ochre, on large phallic-shaped fertility stones on
        the Mesakin and Korongo Hills in south Sudan indicate the sex of the child
        to whom prayers are offered (Bell, 1936). A circle bisected by a line or circles
        bisected by two crosses represent boys. Girls are represented by a cross (drawn
        diagonally) or a slanting line (like a forward slash)(Russell, 2013: 17).\n\nAlthough
        pastoralist geometric motifs are widespread in the rock art of eastern Africa,
        attempting to find the meaning behind geometric designs is problematic. The
        examples discussed here demonstrate that motifs can have multiple authors,
        even in the same location, and that identical symbols can be the products
        of very different behaviours. \n"

      body: Rock art in Uganda is mostly concentrated in the eastern part of the country,
        but more broadly sits within a regional belt of geometric rock art spanning
        East and Central Africa. It is mainly geometric in nature and includes both
        paintings (red and white being the most common pigment) and engravings; it
        comprises a basic and recurring repertoire of shapes including circular, rectangular,
        sausage, dot and lines. Concentric circles with rays emanating from them are
        a unique feature of Ugandan rock art.

        The first documentation of rock art in Uganda occurred in 1913 (Teso Report) at Nyero, a painted rock shelter of the Later Iron Age period. After its initial recording the site was subsequently cited in a 1945 excavation report (Harwich, 1961) and meticulously noted by J.C.D Lawrance during the 1950s. Only a small number of studies of Ugandan rock art rock art have been published (Wayland 1938; Lawrance 1953; Posnansky 1961; Morton 1967; Chaplin 1974), with early analyses being predominantly descriptive and highly speculative.

        The first major publications on Ugandan rock art emerged in the 1960s (Posnansky 1961; Morton 1967; Chaplin 1974) with rock art researchers proposing that the geometric and non-representational depictions served a documentary purpose of identifying cultural groups such as hunter-gatherers, cultivators or pastoralists. During this decade researchers attempted to place the rock art in a chronological framework, tying it to broader archaeological sequences. Political instability greatly impeded research during the 1970s and 1980s, although Chaplin’s thesis and in-depth survey on prehistoric rock art of Lake Victoria was published posthumously in 1974.

        Attempts to understand the chronology of Ugandan rock in the 1960s were based on sequences focusing on pigments used in paintings. Lawrance proposed that yellow paintings were the oldest; followed by orange, red, purple, red and white; white and dirty white were the latest in the sequence. It is highly problematic developing sequences based on pigments because of the ways in which they chemically react with particular surfaces, other pigments and the natural elements, which can compromise the integrity of the pigment. However, there appears to be a consistency (across East and Central Africa) that suggests red and white geometric paintings are the oldest and have been in existence for millennia.

        Initially thought to be the work of San Bushmen of southern Africa, archaeological, genetic and ethnographic evidence has subsequently attributed the paintings to the Batwa people, a cultural group who are today found in small groups near the Rwanda/Uganda border. If it is accepted that the geometric imagery was made by these hunter-gatherers then the rock art of Uganda probably dates from between 12,000 to 1,000 years ago.

        Nyero (and another site at Kakoro) has dated the paintings to between 5,000
        and 1,600 years ago. It has been proposed that rock shelters were used by
        semi-nomadic peoples engaged in animal herding, which they used as reference
        points in the landscape. Generally positioned away from flat land, they may
        have served to direct herders of cattle and/or goats towards paths and water.

        geometric art in Uganda looked at the ways in which the geometric shapes in
        the rock art can be associated with the ethnographies of hunter-gatherers
        of the region. The approach proposed that the symbolism of geometric rock
        art derives from a gendered forest worldview. The forest is pivotal to hunter/gatherer
        cosmology in this region, whereby it plays a central role in cultural production
        and reproduction over time and is regarded as both male and female. The forest
        is not only a source of subsistence and well-being but informs their identity
        and the rock art reflects these complex concepts.

      body: It is difficult to determine when rock art sites were last used, and in
        some cases, such as at Nyero, sites are still in use by local peoples with
        offerings being made and sites associated with rain-making rituals. However,
        the advent of colonialism influenced such traditions bringing a change in
        the way the forest was venerated, used and conceptualised.
