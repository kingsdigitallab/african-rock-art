      body: Running from the Red Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, the Sahara is by far the
        world's largest hot desert. It covers over 3,500,000 square miles (9,000,000
        sq. km), a tenth of the whole African Continent. Yet we know it was not always
        so. Archaeological and geological research has shown that the Sahara has undergone
        major climatic changes since the end of the last Ice Age (c. 10,000 BC). During
        this period, rain was far more abundant, and vast areas of the current desert
        were a savannah. By around 4,200 BC, changes in the rainfall and seasonal
        patterns led to a gradual desertification of the Sahara into an arid expanse.
        The analysis of archaeological sites, animal bones and preserved vegetal remains
        tell us of a greener world, where some of the earliest attempts at domestication
        of animals and rudimentary farming took place.

        Little is known about the people who lived in the Sahara thousands of years ago; however, through rock art, we can discern who they may have been and what images were important to them. Throughout the desert, rock art engravings and paintings depict an earlier story of the Sahara: the wild animals that lived there; the cattle herds that provided food and labour; their daily activities and beliefs are all displayed in caves and cliffs, valleys or plateaus.

        The Messak Settafet is one of these places. Situated in the Sahara, it is a large plateau running southwest to northeast through the Libyan province of Fezzan, near the borders of Algeria and Niger. Both plateaus are crossed by numerous wadis (dry riverbeds) that run to the east, flanked by cliffs filled with tens of thousands of rock art depictions, including some of the oldest engravings in the Sahara. Rich with depictions of the savannah, the rock art shows buffaloes, crocodiles, ostriches or hippopotami, all of which tells us of a wetter Sahara thousands of years ago.

        It is difficult to determine the motives of the people that created these images. There are many theories about why these people created rock art, what exactly is depicted and what the images meant to that group. One area of particular research interest is the depiction of mythical beings, therianthropic figures (part human part animal) and anthropomorphic animals (the personification of animals in human forms). Were these religious images? Cultural folklore? Or simply images pleasing to a group or culture?

      body: The technical quality of the engravings is exceptional, with deeply outlined
        and carefully polished bodies and carved cupules within their heads to depict
        eyes. Claws were also marked, maybe to reinforce the idea of fighting. The
        specific type of animal depicted is subject to debate among scholars. Some
        have described them as monkeys or mythological blends of monkeys and men.
        Their pointed ears could also identify them as cat-like figures, although
        most probably they were the representation of mythical beings, considering
        their prominence above all other figures in this area. A polished line comes
        out from the waist of both figures to join four small ostriches, depicted
        between them, which often accompany rock art in this region.

        Another example of fighting cats has been found nearby, although it is neither so carefully made nor in such a prominent place. The similarity is, however, astonishing, and we may wonder if this second pair of beings could be a copy of the first pair, thus reflecting its symbolic importance in the people’s collective imagination.

        As is often the case with rock art, the interpretation of these images remains up for discussion. Given the care taken to engrave the images, their technical quality and their dominant position in the landscape, we can gather that these images potentially had deep meaning for the people who created them thousands of years ago, and were possibly meant to be a symbolic as well as a physical landmark for travellers and local people alike. Although the original purpose and meaning have long since been lost, the expressive power of the engravings still remains, allowing us to gain a small view into the world of the people that lived in the Sahara thousands of years ago, when it was a sprawling green savannah.

        Historically, much of the rock art from across northern Africa has been classified according to a particular style or ‘school’ of depictions. One such category of images, known as the Libyan Warrior School or Libyan Warrior style is found predominantly in Niger. Typically, this style

        “…commonly depicts human figures, mainly armed warriors; women are very rare. The style is fairly crude and the technique unsophisticated, almost invariably a rather careless pecking. The figures, almost always presented frontally with their heads quite circular, with added lobes, or mushroom-shaped, are shown according to a symmetrical schema. Various garment decorations and feathers in the hair are common, and the warrior often holds one or two throwing-spears – the bow is almost lacking – and frequently also holds by the leading rein a typical horse; foreshortened with large hindquarters” (Muzzolini, 2001:614)

        Termed *Libyan Warriors* by French ethnographer Henri Lhote, these representations have been associated with Garamantes’ raids, possibly 2,500 years ago. Thought to be descended from Berbers and Saharan pastoralists who settled in central Libya from around 1500 BC, the Garamantes developed a thriving urban centre, with flourishing trade networks from Libya to Niger. In contrast, Francis Rodd, a military man who led two big expeditions to the Sahara in the 1920s, proposed that these figures represent Tuareg; a people reputedly of Berber descent who live a nomadic pastoralist lifestyle. They have their own script known as Tifinagh, which is thought to have Libyan roots and which is engraved onto rocks alongside other rock art depictions.

        Libyan Warrior figures are almost exclusively located in the Aïr Mountains of Niger although can also be found in the Adrar des Iforas, north-east Mali extending into Algeria.  Defining the Libyan Warrior Period chronologically is a challenge and dates are fairly fluid; the earliest dates suggested start from 5,200 years ago; it certainly coincides with the Horse period between 3,000-2,000 years ago but has also been proposed to continue throughout the Camel Period, from 2,000 years ago to present.

        From the sample of images we have as part of this collection it is clear that not all figures designated as falling under the umbrella term of Libyan Warrior style all share the same characteristics; there are similarities, differences and adjacencies even between what we may term a ‘typical’ representation. Of course, if these images span a period of 5,000 years then this may account for the variability in the depictions.

      body: However, for the majority of figures their posture is remarkably similar
        even though objects of material culture and the types of garments they wear
        may show more diversity. The overriding feature is that figures are positioned
        frontally with arms bent and raised, often displaying splayed fingers. In
        some cases figures hold weapons and shields, but some do not. Some wear obviously
        elaborate headdresses, but in others the features look more coiffure-like.
        Selected garments are decorated with geometric patterns, others are plain;
        not all wear items of personal ornamentation. Certainly, not all figures are
        associated with horses, as typically characterised. Moreover, rather than
        all being described as unsophisticated or careless, many are executed showing
        great technique and skill. So how do we start to make sense of this contradiction
        between consistency and variation?

      body: A criticism of Saharan rock art research, in comparison to that which
        has focused on other parts of Africa, is an under-theorisation of how the
        art links to past ethnic, archaeological or other identities (Smith,2013:156).
        This is tricky when dealing with past societies which were potentially nomadic,
        and where their archaeological remains are scarce. However, recent anthropological
        research may inform our thinking in this area. A member of the Wodaabe cultural
        group (nomadic cattle-herders and traders in the Sahel) on seeing a photograph
        of a Libyan-Warrior engraving and noting the dress and earrings told photographer
        Carol Beckwith that it represents a woman performing a traditional greeting
        dance with arms outstretched and about to clap (Coulson and Campbell,2001:210).

      body: "Such a comment suggests that local ethnographies might assist in an understanding
        of more recent rock art, that not all figures described as Libyan-Warrior
        may necessarily be the same; and indeed that women may not be as rare as previously
        documented. In fact, the Wodaabe have been noted to resemble figures in other
        Saharan rock art contexts (see article on Hairdressing in the Acacus).\n\nIf
        we accept that some of these representations share affinities with the Wodaabe
        then thinking about this category of images from an ethnographic perspective
        may prove productive. Moreover, the British Museum’s existing ethnographic
        collections are simultaneously a useful resource by which we can potentially
        add more meaning to the rock art images.\n\nThe Wodaabe belong to the Fulani
        people, numbering 20 million and currently living across eighteen countries.
        The Wodaabe comprise 2-3% of the Fulani cultural group, still live as true
        nomads and are considered to have the most traditional culture of all the
        Fulani (Bovin,2001:13).\t\n"

      body: "The Wodaabe have become particularly well-known in the West through visual
        anthropology, because of their emphasis on cultivating male personal beauty
        and adornment. Men invest enormous amounts of time in personal artistic expression;
        much more so than women. Anthropologists have documented the constant checking
        of Wodaabe men in their mirrors; a Wodaabe man will not even go out among
        the cows in the morning until he has checked and tidied himself. They spend
        hours every day on their appearance and have been described as styling themselves
        like “living paintings” and “living statues” (Bovin, 2001:72). Symmetry plays
        a particularly significant part in Wodaabe culture and is reflected in all
        their artistic expressions. Symmetry stands for culture, asymmetry stands
        for nature. Culture is order and nature is disorder (Bovin,2001:17). Everyday
        Wodaabe life is imbued with artistic expression, whereby “every individual
        is an active creator, decorator and performer (Bovin, 2001:15).\n\nSo, how
        might we see Wodaabe cultural traits reflected in the Libyan-Warrior figures?\n\nPlumage
        is often depicted on these Warrior figures and for the most part is assumed
        to simply be part of the warrior regalia. The ostrich feather, a phallic symbol
        in Wodaabe culture, is an important element in male adornment and is carefully
        placed in the axis of symmetry in the middle of a man’s turban, worn during
        dancing ceremonies (Bovin, 2001:41). Music and dancing are typical of Fulani
        traditions, characterized by group singing and accompanied by clapping, stomping
        and bells. The feathers in the British Museum’s collections are known to be
        dance ornaments, worn during particular ceremonies. \n"

      body: One of the recurring features of the Warrior engravings is the round discs
        that seem to be suspended from a figure’s arm or shoulder. Historically, these
        have been interpreted as shields, which one might expect a warrior to be carrying
        and in part this may be the case.

        used as vessel covers or food trays; both of which are vital items in a nomadic
        lifestyle. Alternatively, they may represent calabashes. Wodaabe women measure
        their worldly wealth in calabashes and can acquire many in a lifetime, mostly
        ornamental to be displayed only on certain ceremonial occasions. If some of
        these depictions are not necessarily men or warriors then what have been considered
        shields may in fact represent some other important item of material culture.

        There is also a consensus within Wodaabe society about beauty and ugliness; what makes something beautiful or indeed ugly generally is agreed upon, there is a commonality of taste. This may account for the paradox of why there is individuality within a corpus of images that inherently are comparable (Bovin,2001:16).

        As nomads, Wodaabe do not identify themselves by place or territory as such, but a Wodaabe’s body is a repository of culture to mark them out against nature. Culture is not seen as an unessential indulgence but as an imperative necessity, it is part of one’s survival and existence in an inhospitable environment. We may speculate that rock art images may be seen as a way of stamping culture on nature; markers of socialised space.

      body: This brief review was motivated, in part, by the underlying problems inherent
        in the categorisation of visual culture. Historically assigned classifications
        are not fixed and armed with current knowledge across a range of resources
        we may provide further insights into these enigmatic representations. Obviously,
        a much more systematic study of this category known as Libyan-Warrior figures
        needs to be undertaken to determine their distribution and the similarities
        and differences between depictions across sites. Additionally, care must be
        taken making connections with a cultural group whose material culture has
        changed over the course of the twentieth century. Nevertheless, it seems the
        category of Libyan-Warrior figures is an area that is ripe for more intensive
        investigation.

      body: A number of sites we have been cataloguing recently, located in the Libyan
        Desert, notably the Fezzan region, have included paintings of chariots in
        a variety of forms, dating to the Horse Period, from up to 3,000 years ago.
        This has stimulated some interesting questions about the use of chariots in
        what appears to be such a seemingly inappropriate environment for a wheeled
        vehicle, as well as the nature of representation. Why were chariots used in
        the desert and why were they represented in such different ways?

      body: The chariot has been one of the great empowering innovations of history.
        It likely originated in Mesopotamia about 3000 BC due to advances in metallurgy
        during the Bronze Age, and has served as a primary means of transport until
        quite recently in the historical period across Africa, Eurasia and Europe.
        Chariots provided rapid and efficient transport, and were ideal for the battlefield
        as the design provided a raised firing platform for archers . As a result
        the chariot became the principal war machine from the Egyptians through to
        the Romans; and the Chinese, who owned an army of 10,000 chariots. Indeed,
        our use of the word car is a derivative of the Latin word carrus, meaning
        ‘a chariot of war or of triumph’.

      body: The chariot in the Sahara was probably introduced by the Garamantes, a
        cultural group thought to be descended from Berbers and Saharan pastoralists.
        There is little textual information about the Garamantes, documentation comes
        mainly from Greek and Roman sources. Herodotus described them as ‘a very great
        nation’. Recent archaeological research has shown that the Garamantes established
        about eight major towns as well as numerous other settlements, and were ‘brilliant
        farmers, resourceful engineers, and enterprising merchants’. The success of
        the Garamantes was based on their subterranean water-extraction system, a
        network of underground tunnels, allowing the Garamantian culture to flourish
        in an increasingly arid environment, resulting in population expansion, urbanisation,
        and conquest.

      body: On average there are about 500 drawings of chariots across the Sahara,
        from the Fezzan in Libya through the Aïr of Niger into northern Mali and then
        westward to the Atlantic coast; but not all were produced by the Garamantes.
        It is still not certain that chariots were driven along the routes where their
        depictions occur; remains of chariots have never been found west of the Fezzan.
        However, the Fezzan states were thriving trade routes and chariots are likely
        to have been used to transport salt, cloth, beads and metal goods in exchange
        for gold, ivory and slaves. The widespread occurrence of chariot imagery on
        Saharan rock outcrops has led to the proposition of ‘chariot routes’ linking
        North and West Africa. However, these vehicles were not suited for long-distance
        transport across desert terrain; more localised use is probable, conducted
        through middlemen who were aware of the trade routes through the desert landscape.
        Additionally, the horse at this time was a prestige animal and it is unlikely
        that they facilitated transport across the Saharan trade routes, with travellers
        rather utilising donkeys or oxen.

      body: The absence of archaeological evidence for chariots has led to the suggestion
        that some representations of chariots may have been the result of cultural
        diffusion, transmitted orally by nomadic peoples traversing the region. Artists
        may never have actually seen the vehicles themselves. If this is the case,
        chariot symbols may have acquired some special meaning above their function
        as modes of transport. It may also explain why some representations of chariots
        do not seem to conform to more conventional styles of representations and
        account for the different ways in which they were depicted.

        Figs. 7 and 8 may or may not depict chariots. The rectangular shape in the top left of Fig. 7 and to the left in Fig. 8 are potentially abstracted forms of the chariot similar to the ‘flattened out’ depictions above in Figs. 5 and 6. The representation in Fig. 7 sits alongside distinguishing figures of the Horse Period when chariots were being used, such as geometric bi-triangular figures, spears or lances, women wearing long dresses, and animals drawn in a fairly naturalistic style.

        Beside the schematic and simply depicted chariots, there is also a group which has been termed the ‘flying gallop chariots’ (Fig.3 above and Fig. 9 below). Their distribution includes the whole Tassili region, although there are fewer in the Acacus Mountains. They resemble the classical two-wheeled antique chariots, generally drawn by two horses, but sometimes three, or even four. The driver is usually alone, and is depicted in a typical style with a stick head. The majority are shown at full speed, with the driver holding a whip standing on a small platform, sometimes straining forward.

        In a similar manner to the schematic chariots, the depictions in Figs. 3 and 9 display the entire platform and both wheels of the chariot. In addition, more than one horse is depicted as a single horse in profile with numerous legs indicating multiple horses; an artistic technique first seen during the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe. Interestingly, in the Libyan rock art of the Acacus Mountains it seemed that animals could be conceived of in profile and in movement, but chariots were conceived of differently, and are represented in plain view, seen from above or in three-quarters perspective.

        Why are chariots depicted in a variety of ways, and what can we say about the nature of representation in relation to chariots? It is clear that chariots are able to be depicted in profile view (Fig. 1), yet there are variations that digress from this perspective. In relation to the few examples we have come across so far in the Acacus Mountains in south-western Libya, one observation we might make is that the ways in which chariots have been represented may be indicative of the ways in which they have been observed by the artists representing them; as a rule from above. The rock shelters in the Acacus are often some height above the now dried up wadis, and so the ways in which they conceived of representing the chariot itself , whether as a flying gallop chariot, a chariot drawn by a bovid or as an abstraction, may have become a particular representational convention. The ways in which animals were represented conformed also to a convention, one that had a longer tradition, but chariots were an innovation and may have been represented as they were observed; from higher up in the rockshelters; thus chariots were conceived of as a whole and from an aerial perspective. The ways in which environments affect our perceptions of dimension, space and colour are now well-established, initially through cross-cultural anthropological studies in the 1960s, and becoming better understood through more recent research concerning the brain. Of course, this is speculation, and further research would be needed to consider all the possibilities. But for now, we can start to see some intriguing lines of enquiry and research areas that these images have stimulated.

      body: Vast trading network across the Sahara Desert not only facilitated the
        spread of goods, but the routes served as a conduit for cultural diffusion
        through the spread of knowledge, ideas and technologies. Chariots were both
        functional and symbolic. As a mode of transport, as a weapon of war, as a
        means of trade and exchange and as a symbol of power, the chariot has been
        a cultural artefact for 4,000 years. Its temporal and spatial reach is evident
        not only in the rock art, but through the British Museum collections, which
        reveal comparisons between 2D rock art and 3D artefacts. Similarities and
        adjacencies occur not only in the structure and design of the chariots themselves
        but in their symbolic and pragmatic nature (Figs. 10–14).

      body: 'Rock art occurs in two main areas in Libya: the Tadrart Acacus and the
        Messak Plateau. The oldest works of rock art, from the Acacus Mountains, are
        engravings of mammals from the Wild Fauna Period (Early Hunter Period) and
        could be up to 12,000 years old. Thousands of paintings dating from up to
        8,000-9,000 years ago show a diversity of imagery and include scenes of hunting,
        pastoralism, daily life, dancing and a variety of wild and domesticated animals.
        The Messak Plateau is home to tens of thousands of engravings, and only a
        few paintings have been located in this region to date. The area is best known
        for larger-than-life-size engravings of animals such as elephants, rhino and
        bubalus (a now extinct buffalo), and some of the most iconic depictions in
        Saharan rock art, such as the ‘Fighting Cats’ scene.'

        region of North Africa, bordered on the west by Tunisia and Algeria, Egypt
        to the east, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. Except for the narrow
        strip along the coast, where 80% of the population resides, Libya lies entirely
        within the Sahara Desert. The main areas of rock art lie in the south-western
        corner of the country, with the Tadrart Acacus continuing into south-eastern
        Algeria, where they are simply known as the Tadrart. The Acacus in Libya and
        the Tadrart in Algeria are now listed and combined as a trans-frontier World
        Heritage Site by UNESCO, linking these two geographically divided sites into
        a cultural whole.

        expedition in 1850, although it was not until 1932 that the engravings were
        methodically studied by Leo Frobenius. Some initial interpretative hypotheses
        about the rock art in the Acacus were formulated in the late 1930s by Italian
        archaeologist Paolo Graziosi. Subsequently, the region became the subject
        of systematic investigation by Fabrizio Mori, another Italian archaeologist,
        who also published the first scientific papers on Libyan rock art in the 1960s.
        Since then, consistent surveying has continued in this region and stratigraphic
        excavations of archaeological deposits have established a cultural sequence
        dating back to the Holocene Period.

      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 4'
      body: |-
        Rock art chronology in North Africa is based largely on the combination of stylistic features, superimposition, subject matter and the degree of weathering or patina. While not an exact science, chronological periods are recognisable in the depictions, which generally correspond to climatic and environmental phases. Some of the oldest images are found on the Messak plateau and represent a Sahara that was significantly wetter and more fertile than today, exemplified by representations of large mammals – some of which are aquatic species – incised into the rock faces.

        The chronology of the Tadrart Acacus during the Holocene has been established more firmly through the excavation and dating of archaeological sites. Based on this evidence, these earliest images may coincide with the first Holocene occupation of the area by specialised hunter-gatherers – known as the 'Early Acacus' Period – which some researchers date to around 11,000 years ago.

      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 5'
      body: From around 9,000 years ago, the archaeological record in the Acacus changes;
        sites are larger, featuring more formalised stone structures with heavy grinding
        equipment and large pots. Subsistence strategies based on hunting and gathering
        remain, but archaeological evidence suggests the presence of corralling Barbary
        sheep and the storage of wild cereals. Fragments of grinding stones with traces
        of colour from the Takarkori rock shelter, dating from between 6,800–5,400
        BC, may have been used as palettes for rock or body painting, and have been
        connected chronologically to the Round Head Period. A large proportion of
        paintings in this period portray very large figures with round, featureless
        heads and can often be depicted in ‘floating’ positions; women often have
        their hands raised, interpreted as postures of supplication.

        Historical records have tended to date the introduction of both the horse and the camel in northern Africa rather than the archaeological record. Yet, in terms of rock art research in this region, less attention has been given to these styles; the reason for this may be that the earliest rock art attracted more scholarly consideration than the later depictions. However, their representation certainly demonstrates the changing natural and cultural environment and associated human responses and adaptations.

        The rock art of Libya is a visual testament to the changing fortunes of this part of the Sahara and the cultural groups who have occupied and navigated the area over thousands of years. The engravings and paintings act as a legacy, tracing the environmental effects of climate change, how people have adapted to that change and the cultural worlds they have created.
