      body: Running from the Red Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, the Sahara is by far the
        world's largest hot desert. It covers over 3,500,000 square miles (9,000,000
        sq. km), a tenth of the whole African Continent. Yet we know it was not always
        so. Archaeological and geological research has shown that the Sahara has undergone
        major climatic changes since the end of the last Ice Age (c. 10,000 BC). During
        this period, rain was far more abundant, and vast areas of the current desert
        were a savannah. By around 4,200 BC, changes in the rainfall and seasonal
        patterns led to a gradual desertification of the Sahara into an arid expanse.
        The analysis of archaeological sites, animal bones and preserved vegetal remains
        tell us of a greener world, where some of the earliest attempts at domestication
        of animals and rudimentary farming took place.

        Little is known about the people who lived in the Sahara thousands of years ago; however, through rock art, we can discern who they may have been and what images were important to them. Throughout the desert, rock art engravings and paintings depict an earlier story of the Sahara: the wild animals that lived there; the cattle herds that provided food and labour; their daily activities and beliefs are all displayed in caves and cliffs, valleys or plateaus.

        The Messak Settafet is one of these places. Situated in the Sahara, it is a large plateau running southwest to northeast through the Libyan province of Fezzan, near the borders of Algeria and Niger. Both plateaus are crossed by numerous wadis (dry riverbeds) that run to the east, flanked by cliffs filled with tens of thousands of rock art depictions, including some of the oldest engravings in the Sahara. Rich with depictions of the savannah, the rock art shows buffaloes, crocodiles, ostriches or hippopotami, all of which tells us of a wetter Sahara thousands of years ago.

        It is difficult to determine the motives of the people that created these images. There are many theories about why these people created rock art, what exactly is depicted and what the images meant to that group. One area of particular research interest is the depiction of mythical beings, therianthropic figures (part human part animal) and anthropomorphic animals (the personification of animals in human forms). Were these religious images? Cultural folklore? Or simply images pleasing to a group or culture?

        and carefully polished bodies and carved cupules within their heads to depict
        eyes. Claws were also marked, maybe to reinforce the idea of fighting. The
        specific type of animal depicted is subject to debate among scholars. Some
        have described them as monkeys or mythological blends of monkeys and men.
        Their pointed ears could also identify them as cat-like figures, although
        most probably they were the representation of mythical beings, considering
        their prominence above all other figures in this area. A polished line comes
        out from the waist of both figures to join four small ostriches, depicted
        between them, which often accompany rock art in this region.

        Another example of fighting cats has been found nearby, although it is neither so carefully made nor in such a prominent place. The similarity is, however, astonishing, and we may wonder if this second pair of beings could be a copy of the first pair, thus reflecting its symbolic importance in the people’s collective imagination.

        As is often the case with rock art, the interpretation of these images remains up for discussion. Given the care taken to engrave the images, their technical quality and their dominant position in the landscape, we can gather that these images potentially had deep meaning for the people who created them thousands of years ago, and were possibly meant to be a symbolic as well as a physical landmark for travellers and local people alike. Although the original purpose and meaning have long since been lost, the expressive power of the engravings still remains, allowing us to gain a small view into the world of the people that lived in the Sahara thousands of years ago, when it was a sprawling green savannah.

      body: Hair is a global form of social communication. Among numerous social groups
        throughout Africa, hairstyling and hairdressing hold great cultural and aesthetic
        significance. Coiffures have been regarded as indicative of ethnic origin,
        gender and stages of life development – as well as simply fashion – and have
        been related to power, age, religion and politics. The transitory yet highly
        visible nature of hair ensures its suitability as a medium for personal and
        social expression. And it is not just the domain of women; elaborate hair-styling
        for men can be an equally important indicator of their place in society.

        A particularly interesting set of images from Uan Amil in the Acacus Mountains, south-western Libya, reflect the cultural significance of hair in African societies. The scenes depict groups of people engaged in a variety of communal social practices wearing elaborate coiffures, together with some very discrete moments of personal hairdressing.

        The image below, which is part of a larger panel, shows an intimate moment between two persons, an individual with an ornate coiffure washing or attending to the hair of another. In some African societies, a person’s choice of hairdresser is dictated by their relationship to them. It is most often the work of friends or family to whom you entrust your hair. In the hands of a stranger or adversary hair can be used as an ingredient in the production a powerful substance that could afflict its owner - such is the potency of hair. This image conveys such intimacy.

      body: 'The rock shelter of Uan Amil was discovered in 1957 by the Italian-Libyan
        Joint Archaeological Mission surveying in the Acacus and Messak regions of
        Libya. Excavations have indicated the shelter was in use over a long period,
        with at least three main occupational phases between the 8th and 4th millennium
        BP. Italian archaeologist Fabrizio Mori has dated these paintings to 6,000
        years ago, while David Coulson has been more cautious and has suggested that
        the presence of a metal blade on the arrow head seen at the bottom of this
        image may indicate a more recent age. Notwithstanding the problems associated
        with the dating of rock art, the subject matter is intriguing. It has been
        suggested that today’s Wodaabe nomads of Niger resemble the people on these
        rock paintings: ‘the cattle look the same, as do the campsites with their
        calf-ropes, and the women’s hairstyles with the special bun on the forehead.
        The female hair bun is big and round like a globe.’(Bovin, 2001:12).'

        The Wodaabe number around 125,000. As pastoral nomads they migrate often and over large geographical areas, keeping mahogany-coloured Zebu cattle which have a hump on their back and long horns, shaped like a lyre. As a cultural group they have attracted much anthropological attention because of their traditional values of beauty (in particular the male beauty pageant) which pervades their everyday lives and practices.

        Wodaabe seldom wash their entire bodies mainly because of the scarcity of water. Water from wells is mainly used for drinking by humans and animals. Washing the body and clothes is less of a priority; and hair is hardly ever washed. When Wodaabe put rancid butter on their hair it is to make it soft and shiny and cleanse it of dust and lice. To them rancid butter gives a nice sweet smell (Bovin, 2001:56).  In the above image ([2013,2034.473](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3581674&partId=1&searchText=2013,2034.473&page=1)) at the top right, a vessel sits between the two individuals that may have served to hold rancid butter used in the preparation of the hair. In fact, treating the hair with butter is a widespread practice in African societies. In addition, Wodaabe never cut their hair. Men and women alike desire to have their hair as long as possible. The ideal girl should have long, thick black hair, enough to make a huge round bun on her forehead, while the ideal young male should have long, thick black hair to make braids to the shoulders.

        A long, narrow face is also admired and this is enhanced by shaping the hair on top of the head, and also using an ostrich feather to elongate the face (Bovin,2001:26). The painting above, from Wadi Teshuinat, characterises this.

        Interestingly, the coiffures in the images here are light in colour and do not conform to the black ideal as indicated above. It has been suggested that this represents Caucasians with blonde hair. However, it may also be a visual strategy to emphasise the aesthetics of the coiffure. Hairstyles in African sculpture are often shown conceptually, rather than mimetically; idealising rather than copying exactly from contemporary hairdressing practices. In this respect representation follows artistic traditions as much as, or more than, it responds to ephemeral shifts in fashion.

      body: The cultural importance of hair is evident where depictions of hair-washing,
        hairstyling or hair preparation are an active element within more complex
        social and cultural activities, such as preparations for a wedding or a scene
        of supplication. In addition, the C-shaped feature in the image above has
        been suggested to be a coiled snake, and the figure sits between the head
        and tail. It may seem incongruous to have hair preparation scenes represented
        within a tableau representing a wedding or ceremonial meeting, but may say
        something more about the nature of representation. In each case, these may
        represent a conceptual depiction of time and space. These activities are not
        ones that occur concurrently temporally and spatially, but rather represent
        an assemblage of discrete moments that contribute to each ceremony in its
        entirety.

      body: The Wodaabe invest vast amounts of time and resources in their outward
        appearance and the need to beautify and refine. ‘Art’ is not just something
        that is aesthetically pleasing - it is a necessity of life, a necessity that
        must be exhibited. While there are likely to be a variety of complex social,
        economic and cultural motivations, that necessity is possibly additionally
        driven or fuelled by a seemingly desolate, unadorned, irregular landscape.
        The importance lies in distinguishing oneself as a cultural being rather than
        the ‘uncultured other’, such as an animal; and hair is an apposite medium
        by which to make this nature/culture distinction. Hair care in African societies
        is unmistakably aesthetic in its aspirations as it gets transferred into other
        artistic mediums, and the divide between nature and culture is thoroughly
        and intentionally in play. To transform hair is to transform nature, and is
        truly an artistic discipline.

      body: A number of sites from this Collection are located in the Libyan Desert,
        notably the Fezzan region, and include paintings of chariots in a variety
        of forms dating to the Horse Period, from up to 3,000 years ago. This has
        stimulated some interesting questions about the use of chariots in what appears
        to be such a seemingly inappropriate environment for a wheeled vehicle, as
        well as the nature of representation. Why were chariots used in the desert
        and why were they represented in such different ways?

      body: The chariot has been one of the great empowering innovations of history.
        It likely originated in Mesopotamia about 3000 BC due to advances in metallurgy
        during the Bronze Age, and has served as a primary means of transport until
        quite recently in the historical period across Africa, Eurasia and Europe.
        Chariots provided rapid and efficient transport, and were ideal for the battlefield
        as the design provided a raised firing platform for archers . As a result
        the chariot became the principal war machine from the Egyptians through to
        the Romans; and the Chinese, who owned an army of 10,000 chariots. Indeed,
        our use of the word car is a derivative of the Latin word carrus, meaning
        ‘a chariot of war or of triumph’.

      body: The chariot in the Sahara was probably introduced by the Garamantes, a
        cultural group thought to be descended from Berbers and Saharan pastoralists.
        There is little textual information about the Garamantes, documentation comes
        mainly from Greek and Roman sources. Herodotus described them as ‘a very great
        nation’. Recent archaeological research has shown that the Garamantes established
        about eight major towns as well as numerous other settlements, and were ‘brilliant
        farmers, resourceful engineers, and enterprising merchants’. The success of
        the Garamantes was based on their subterranean water-extraction system, a
        network of underground tunnels, allowing the Garamantian culture to flourish
        in an increasingly arid environment, resulting in population expansion, urbanisation,
        and conquest.

      body: On average there are about 500 drawings of chariots across the Sahara,
        from the Fezzan in Libya through the Aïr of Niger into northern Mali and then
        westward to the Atlantic coast; but not all were produced by the Garamantes.
        It is still not certain that chariots were driven along the routes where their
        depictions occur; remains of chariots have never been found west of the Fezzan.
        However, the Fezzan states were thriving trade routes and chariots are likely
        to have been used to transport salt, cloth, beads and metal goods in exchange
        for gold, ivory and slaves. The widespread occurrence of chariot imagery on
        Saharan rock outcrops has led to the proposition of ‘chariot routes’ linking
        North and West Africa. However, these vehicles were not suited for long-distance
        transport across desert terrain; more localised use is probable, conducted
        through middlemen who were aware of the trade routes through the desert landscape.
        Additionally, the horse at this time was a prestige animal and it is unlikely
        that they facilitated transport across the Saharan trade routes, with travellers
        rather utilising donkeys or oxen.

      body: The absence of archaeological evidence for chariots has led to the suggestion
        that some representations of chariots may have been the result of cultural
        diffusion, transmitted orally by nomadic peoples traversing the region. Artists
        may never have actually seen the vehicles themselves. If this is the case,
        chariot symbols may have acquired some special meaning above their function
        as modes of transport. It may also explain why some representations of chariots
        do not seem to conform to more conventional styles of representations and
        account for the different ways in which they were depicted.

        The two images may or may not depict chariots. The rectangular shapes are potentially abstracted forms of the chariot similar to the ‘flattened out’ depictions discussed previously. These potentially abstracted representations often sit alongside distinguishing figures, such as geometric bi-triangular figures, spears or lances, women wearing long dresses, and animals drawn in a fairly naturalistic style, of the Horse Period when the chariots were being used.

        Beside the schematic and simply depicted chariots, there is also a group which has been termed the ‘flying gallop chariots’. Their distribution includes the whole Tassili region, although there are fewer in the Acacus Mountains. They resemble the classical two-wheeled antique chariots, generally drawn by two horses, but sometimes three, or even four. The driver is usually alone, and is depicted in a typical style with a stick head. The majority are shown at full speed, with the driver holding a whip standing on a small platform, sometimes straining forward.

        In a similar manner to the schematic chariots, the 'Flying Gallop' depictions display the entire platform and both wheels of the chariot. In addition, more than one horse is depicted as a single horse in profile with numerous legs indicating multiple horses; an artistic technique first seen during the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe. Interestingly, in the Libyan rock art of the Acacus Mountains it seemed that animals could be conceived of in profile and in movement, but chariots were conceived of differently, and are represented in plain view, seen from above or in three-quarters perspective.

        Why are chariots depicted in a variety of ways, and what can we say about the nature of representation in relation to chariots? It is clear that chariots are able to be depicted in profile view, yet there are variations that digress from this perspective. In relation to the few examples we have come across so far in the Acacus Mountains in south-western Libya, one observation we might make is that the ways in which chariots have been represented may be indicative of the ways in which they have been observed by the artists representing them; as a rule from above. The rock shelters in the Acacus are often some height above the now dried up wadis, and so the ways in which they conceived of representing the chariot itself , whether as a flying gallop chariot, a chariot drawn by a bovid or as an abstraction, may have become a particular representational convention. The ways in which animals were represented conformed also to a convention, one that had a longer tradition, but chariots were an innovation and may have been represented as they were observed; from higher up in the rockshelters; thus chariots were conceived of as a whole and from an aerial perspective. The ways in which environments affect our perceptions of dimension, space and colour are now well-established, initially through cross-cultural anthropological studies in the 1960s, and becoming better understood through more recent research concerning the brain. Of course, this is speculation, and further research would be needed to consider all the possibilities. But for now, we can start to see some intriguing lines of enquiry and research areas that these images have stimulated.

      body: Vast trading networks across the Sahara Desert not only facilitated the
        spread of goods, but the routes served as a conduit for cultural diffusion
        through the spread of knowledge, ideas and technologies. Chariots were both
        functional and symbolic. As a mode of transport, as a weapon of war, as a
        means of trade and exchange and as a symbol of power, the chariot has been
        a cultural artefact for 4,000 years. Its temporal and spatial reach is evident
        not only in the rock art, but through the British Museum collections, which
        reveal comparisons between 2D rock art and 3D artefacts. Similarities and
        adjacencies occur not only in the structure and design of the chariots themselves
        but in their symbolic and pragmatic nature.

        Although the styles and subjects of north African rock art vary, there are commonalities: images are most often figurative and frequently depict animals, both wild and domestic. There are also many images of human figures, sometimes with accessories such as recognisable weaponry or clothing. These may be painted or engraved, with frequent occurrences of both, at times in the same context. Engravings are generally more common, although this may simply be a preservation bias due to their greater durability.

        The physical context of rock art sites varies depending on geographical and topographical factors – for example, Moroccan rock engravings are often found on open rocky outcrops, while Tunisia’s Djebibina rock art sites have all been found in rock shelters. Rock art in the vast and harsh environments of the Sahara is often inaccessible and hard to find, and there is probably a great deal of rock art that is yet to be seen by archaeologists; what is known has mostly been documented within the last century.

        have sought to date and attribute these artworks, with varying measures of
        success. Rock art may be associated with certain cultures through known parallels
        with the imagery in other artefacts, such as Naqada Period designs in Egyptian
        rock art that mirror those on dateable pottery. Authorship may be also guessed
        at through corroborating evidence: for example, due to knowledge of their
        chariot use, and the location of rock art depicting chariots in the central
        Sahara, it has been suggested that it was produced by – or at the same time
        as – the height of the Garamantes culture, a historical ethnic group who formed
        a local power around what is now southern Libya from 500 BC–700 AD. However,
        opportunities to anchor rock art imagery in this way to known ancient cultures
        are few and far between, and rock art is generally ascribed to anonymous hunter-gatherers,
        nomadic peoples, or pastoralists, with occasional imagery-based comparisons
        made with contemporary groups, such as the Fulani peoples.'

        Occasionally, association with writing in the form of, for example, Libyan-Berber or Arabic graffiti can give a known dating margin, but in general, lack of contemporary writing and written sources (Herodotus wrote about the Garamantes) leaves much open to conjecture.

        Other forms of (rare) circumstantial evidence, such as rock art covered by a dateable stratigraphic layer, and (more common) stylistic image-based dating have been used instead to form a chronology of Saharan rock art periods that is widely agreed upon, although dates are contested. The first stage, known as the Early Hunter, Wild Fauna or Bubalus Period, is posited at about 12,000–6,000 years ago, and is typified by naturalistic engravings of wild animals, in particular an extinct form of buffalo identifiable by its long horns.

      body: A possibly concurrent phase is known as the Round Head Period (about 10,000
        to 8,000 years ago) due to the large discoid heads of the painted human figures.
        Following this is the most widespread style, the Pastoral Period (around 7,500
        to 4,000 years ago), which is characterised by numerous paintings and engravings
        of cows, as well as occasional hunting scenes. The Horse Period (around 3,000
        to 2,000 years ago) features recognisable horses and chariots and the final
        Camel Period (around 2,000 years ago to present) features domestic dromedary
        camels, which we know to have been widely used across the Sahara from that
        time.

      body: "While this chronology serves as a useful framework, it must be remembered
        that the area – and the time period in which rock art was produced – is extensive
        and there is significant temporal and spatial variability within and across
        sites. There are some commonalities in rock art styles and themes across the
        Sahara, but there are also regional variations and idiosyncrasies, and a lack
        of evidence that any of these were directly, or even indirectly, related.
        The engravings of weaponry motifs from Morocco and the painted ‘swimming’
        figures of the Gilf Kebir Plateau in Egypt and Sudan are not only completely
        different, but unique to their areas. Being thousands of kilometres apart
        and so different in style and composition, they serve to illustrate the limitations
        inherent in examining northern African rock art as a unit. The contemporary
        political and environmental challenges to accessing rock art sites in countries
        across the Sahara serves as another limiting factor in their study, but as
        dating techniques improve and further discoveries are made, this is a field
        with the potential to help illuminate much of the prehistory of northern Africa.\n\n"

        Messak Plateau. The oldest works of rock art, from the Acacus Mountains, are
        engravings of mammals from the Wild Fauna Period (Early Hunter Period) and
        could be up to 12,000 years old. Thousands of paintings dating from up to
        8,000-9,000 years ago show a diversity of imagery and include scenes of hunting,
        pastoralism, daily life, dancing and a variety of wild and domesticated animals.
        The Messak Plateau is home to tens of thousands of engravings, and only a
        few paintings have been located in this region to date. The area is best known
        for larger-than-life-size engravings of animals such as elephants, rhino and
        bubalus (a now extinct buffalo), and some of the most iconic depictions in
        Saharan rock art, such as the ‘Fighting Cats’ scene.'

        strip along the coast, where 80% of the population resides, Libya lies entirely
        within the Sahara Desert. The main areas of rock art lie in the south-western
        corner of the country, with the Tadrart Acacus continuing into south-eastern
        Algeria, where they are simply known as the Tadrart. The Acacus in Libya and
        the Tadrart in Algeria are now listed and combined as a trans-frontier World
        Heritage Site by UNESCO, linking these two geographically divided sites into
        a cultural whole.

        about the rock art in the Acacus were formulated in the late 1930s by Italian
        archaeologist Paolo Graziosi. Subsequently, the region became the subject
        of systematic investigation by Fabrizio Mori, another Italian archaeologist,
        who also published the first scientific papers on Libyan rock art in the 1960s.
        Since then, consistent surveying has continued in this region and stratigraphic
        excavations of archaeological deposits have established a cultural sequence
        dating back to the Holocene Period.

      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 4'
      body: |-
        Rock art chronology in North Africa is based largely on the combination of stylistic features, superimposition, subject matter and the degree of weathering or patina. While not an exact science, chronological periods are recognisable in the depictions, which generally correspond to climatic and environmental phases. Some of the oldest images are found on the Messak plateau and represent a Sahara that was significantly wetter and more fertile than today, exemplified by representations of large mammals – some of which are aquatic species – incised into the rock faces.

        The chronology of the Tadrart Acacus during the Holocene has been established more firmly through the excavation and dating of archaeological sites. Based on this evidence, these earliest images may coincide with the first Holocene occupation of the area by specialised hunter-gatherers – known as the 'Early Acacus' Period – which some researchers date to around 11,000 years ago.

      body: From around 9,000 years ago, the archaeological record in the Acacus changes;
        sites are larger, featuring more formalised stone structures with heavy grinding
        equipment and large pots. Subsistence strategies based on hunting and gathering
        remain, but archaeological evidence suggests the presence of corralling Barbary
        sheep and the storage of wild cereals. Fragments of grinding stones with traces
        of colour from the Takarkori rock shelter, dating from between 6,800–5,400
        BC, may have been used as palettes for rock or body painting, and have been
        connected chronologically to the Round Head Period. A large proportion of
        paintings in this period portray very large figures with round, featureless
        heads and can often be depicted in ‘floating’ positions; women often have
        their hands raised, interpreted as postures of supplication.

      body: The introduction of domesticates into the region has been identified archaeologically
        at around 8,000 years ago, although full exploitation of cattle for dairying
        is much later at around 6,000 years ago. The development to full pastoral
        systems in the region is complex and prolonged, so it is challenging to track
        any changes from the rock art itself, but the painting of large herds must
        be connected to a full pastoral society.

      title: Horse and Camel Periods
      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 7'
      body: |-
        Historical records have tended to date the introduction of both the horse and the camel in northern Africa rather than the archaeological record. Yet, in terms of rock art research in this region, less attention has been given to these styles; the reason for this may be that the earliest rock art attracted more scholarly consideration than the later depictions. However, their representation certainly demonstrates the changing natural and cultural environment and associated human responses and adaptations.

        The rock art of Libya is a visual testament to the changing fortunes of this part of the Sahara and the cultural groups who have occupied and navigated the area over thousands of years. The engravings and paintings act as a legacy, tracing the environmental effects of climate change, how people have adapted to that change and the cultural worlds they have created.
