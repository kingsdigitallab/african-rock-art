      body: "Game Pass shelter is one of the most well-known rock art sites in South
        Africa. Situated in the foothills of the Drakensberg mountains, a sandstone
        recess atop a steep slope contains rock paintings made by people from the
        San&#124;Bushman¹ communities who historically lived as hunter-gatherers throughout
        southern Africa. The Drakensberg mountains in particular are known for their
        wealth of rock paintings, often showing detailed and brightly coloured images
        of people, animals and part-human, part-animal figures known as ‘therianthropes’,
        with this site a prime example. One of the panels of paintings here is particularly
        important in the history of rock art research, as in the 1970s it helped to
        inspire a new kind of approach to the understanding of the meanings and symbolism
        of San&#124;Bushman paintings and engravings.\n\n"

      body: The most prominent painting panel at Game Pass shows a series of carefully
        depicted eland antelope in delicately shaded red, brown and white pigment,
        largely super-imposing a group of ambiguous anthropomorphic figures wrapped
        in what appear to be bell-shaped karosses (traditional skin cloaks). Several
        small human figures appear to be running above them. These are some of the
        best-preserved rock paintings in the Drakensberg, with the largest animals
        around 30 cm long.  To the left of this panel are two smaller sets of images,
        one with two further eland, some further human-like figures and a human figure
        with a bow; the other (Fig. 1 below) a small panel, for which the site is
        most renowned.   An image around 50 cm long  shows an eland with its face
        turned towards the viewer, depicted as if stumbling forwards, with its hind
        legs crossed.  Grasping the eland's tail is a therianthrope figure with hooves
        for feet. Like the eland, this figure has its legs crossed and is depicted
        with small lines like raised hairs bristling from its body. To the right are
        three further therianthrope figures.

        in a 1915 issue of Scientific American, and it has been frequently published
        on and discussed through the 20th century.  While studying a reproduction
        of the image with the stumbling eland in the early 1970s, researcher David
        Lewis-Williams began to consider that the figure holding the eland's tail
        (Fig. 2 below) might not be a simple illustration of a man wearing a skin
        suit, or performing an act of bravura, as had been suggested by previous researchers,
        but might be “idiomatic and metaphorical, rather than illustrative” (Lewis-Williams
        1981:91).

      body: "This idea was partly inspired by the testimony of Qing, a San&#124;Bushman
        man who, in 1873, had guided the Colonial Administrator Joseph Millerd Orpen
        to rock art sites in the mountains of Lesotho, with which the Drakensberg
        forms a natural eastern border with South Africa and which also contains many
        rock paintings. Qing's explanations of the paintings, some of which Orpen
        copied, included a reference to antelope-headed human figures having “died
        and gone to live in rivers, who were spoilt at the same time as the elands
        and… by the dances of which you have seen paintings”. This, along with testimony
        and practices recorded from other South African San&#124;Bushman people at
        the time, as well as those living elsewhere in south-western Africa in the
        20th century, suggested to Lewis-Williams that these and other images in San&#124;Bushman
        rock art may be a reference to the activities of spiritual leaders or 'shamans',
        people who, in San&#124;Bushman communities, are believed to have the power
        to interact with spirits and the spirit world in ways which may affect the
        physical world. \n\nLewis-Williams and other proponents of this 'shamanistic'
        approach to interpreting San&#124;Bushman rock art have proposed that much
        of its imagery is in fact related to the shaman's experience during the 'trance
        dance' ritual found in all San&#124;Bushman socie-ties. During this activity
        the shaman enters a hallucinatory state in which spiritual ‘tasks’ such as
        healing the sick may be undertaken on behalf of the community. On entering
        the trance state the shaman experiences trembling, sweating, stumbling and
        other symptoms similar to those of a dying antelope hit by a poisoned arrow.
        Lewis Williams noted that among some San&#124;Bushman people this process
        is referred to as ‘dying’ or being ‘spoilt’ and considered that the similarities
        between the eland and the therianthrope figure in this image represent this
        conceived equivalence.\n\n"

        Despite the historical presence of other large game animals in the Drakensberg, the eland is the most commonly depicted animal in rock art of the region. Patricia Vinnicombe, noting this and the focus on other particular subjects in the imagery at the expense of others, proposed in her pioneering 1976 study of the rock art of the Southern Drakensberg *People of the Eland* that the paintings are “not a realistic reflection of the daily pursuits or environment of the Bushmen” (Vinnicombe 1976:347). Vinnicombe recalled that when, in the 1930s, an old Sotho man named Mapote, who had San&#124;Bushman half-siblings and had used to paint with them, was requested to demonstrate, he had said that since the San&#124;Bushmen had been “of the eland”, he should first depict an eland. Based on this and recountings of a myth about the creation and death of the first eland from Qing and other contemporary Southern San&#124;Bushman people, Vinnicombe concluded that the eland, although regularly hunted by the Drakensberg San&#124;Bushmen, had been a particularly sacred or powerful animal to them and that “Through the act of painting and re-painting the eland… the mental conflict involved in destroying a creature that was prized and loved by their deity…was…ritually symbolised and resolved” (Vinnicombe, 1976:350).

        Building on the idea of the spiritual significance of the eland, the approach proposed by Lewis-Williams offered an alternative interpretation by inferring from ethnography that eland were believed to have spiritual ‘potency’. As part of a complex system of beliefs involving conceptions of power and potency in relation to animals and rites, this potency could be released upon death, with trancing shamans believed to be able to harness it, feeling themselves taking on the attributes of the animal. Thus therianthrope figures like those depicted here may be interpreted as representing hallucinatory experiences of shamans in trance, where they may feel that they are assuming the forms of other animals. It has been argued that other motifs such as geometric forms known as 'entoptics' represent the abstract patterns created by neural networks and ‘seen’ during the early stages of entering an altered state of consciousness and that the paintings themselves may have been created as reservoirs of spiritual potency.

        for which the Game Pass panel is sometimes referred to as the ‘Rosetta Stone’,
        gained popularity in the 1980s and has since become the dominant interpretative
        framework for researchers. Debate continues about the extent and nature of
        its applicability in all of San&#124;Bushman rock art, and the extent to which
        myth and ritual not associated with the trance dance may also inform the art.
        Work that connects San&#124;Bushman cosmology and practice with images from
        sites like Game Pass continue to provide interesting insights into these enigmatic
        images. \n\nGame Pass Shelter and many other rock art sites are situated within
        the Maloti-Drakensberg Park, which was inscribed as a  UNESCO Transboundary
        World Heritage Site in 2000. The site is open to the public and accessible
        via a trail from the Kamberg Rock Art Centre.\n\n"

        The rock art of South Africa has probably been studied more extensively than that of any other African country.  It is estimated that South Africa contains many thousands of rock art sites, with a great variety of styles and techniques.  The most well-known rock art in South Africa is that created by the San&#124;Bushman¹ people (several culturally linked groups of indigenous people of southern Africa who were traditionally hunter-gatherers) and their ancestors, with the painted rock shelters of the Drakensberg mountains some of the most well-known rock art sites in the world.  However, the range of South African rock art is wide, spanning great distances, many centuries, and different cultural traditions.

        ¹ San&#124;Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

      title: Geography and rock art distribution
      title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 2'
      body: South Africa covers around 1,213,090 km², encircling Lesotho and bordered
        in the north by Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe and in the west by Mozambique
        and Swaziland.  Much of the interior of the country consists of a high central
        plateau bordered by the Great Escarpment, a rocky ridge which forms the bulk
        of the long Drakensberg mountain system in the east and several smaller ranges
        in the centre and west of the country, as well as the western border with
        Lesotho.  Further to the south, the Cape Fold Mountains mirror the bend of
        the cape coast.  Much of South Africa’s known engraved rock art is found on
        igneous or metamorphic formations in the semi-arid environments of the central
        plateau.  In contrast, painted rock art sites are more commonly located in
        the sandstone and quartzite rock shelters of the mountain systems, which form
        the edges of the more temperate, low-lying coastal regions in the east and
        south of the country.

      title: Hunter-gatherer rock art
      title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 3'
      body: Much of both the painted and engraved rock art of South Africa is characterised
        by its naturalistic depictions of animals, as well as numerous images of people,
        ambiguous figures with mixtures of animal and human features, and certain
        ‘geometric’ or abstract shapes and patterns.  These images are the work of
        San&#124;Bushman people and their ancestors.  Although San&#124;Bushman communities
        now live mainly in Namibia, Botswana and north-western South Africa, historically
        San&#124;Bushman cultural groups lived more widely throughout southern Africa.  Hunter-gatherer
        people are thought to have been the only inhabitants of what is now South
        Africa until the arrival of herding and farming people from the north from
        around 2,000 years ago.

        found in the north-west of the country, featuring mostly white finger-painted
        images of animals such as crocodiles and giraffes and other motifs.  These
        paintings, located in remote areas, are known to have been created by Northern
        Sotho people. Further to the south and west, engraved designs showing conjoined
        circle motifs are found throughout KwaZulu Natal and some areas of Mpumalanga
        and Gauteng Provinces, and appear to have been made by the ancestors of Sotho-Tswana

      title: Herder rock art and other traditions
      title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 5'
      body: Some rock art styles and motifs elsewhere in South Africa seem to belong
        to other unique traditions.  It has been proposed that engraved rock art patterns
        with particular features including circular, linear and oblong motifs found
        at sites across the country, particularly near watercourses, may be the work
        of the Khoekhoen people or their ancestors, herders culturally related to
        the San&#124;Bushmen. Some paintings also appear to reflect this tradition.
        Local rock art traditions specific to certain areas include, among others,
        conglomerations of handprints near the coast in the south-western part of
        the Western Cape and rows of engraved cupules in the north east of the country.
        There are also several examples from different rock art traditions across
        South Africa, of depictions of European people, items or events (such as horses
        and firearms) which clearly date from the 17th century or later.  In the Karoo
        region, rock gongs (natural rock formations with indentations indicating that
        they have been used as percussive instruments) are sometimes associated with
        engraving sites.

        reports from the expedition of  Ensign A. F. Beutler in 1752, describing paintings
        near the Great Fish River in the Eastern Cape.  Further written references
        to rock art from the area were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries,
        with some of the earliest known reproductions of Southern African rock art
        made in the 1770s. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, painted copies
        were made of San&#124;Bushman rock art by amateur artists such as George Stow,

        Zimbabwe and Namibia, while in the interior regions over the previous twenty
        years, Maria Wilman had instigated the first systematic rock engraving recording
        work. This endeavor was built upon from the late 1950s onwards with the extensive
        work of Gerhard and Dora Fock.  In the same decade Alex Willcox pioneered
        the practice of recording rock art through colour photography, and over the
        next twenty years, further recording and analysis projects were undertaken

        analysing paintings from 150 Drakensberg sites and attempting to gain insight
        into their execution and significance through a combination of quantitative
        study and reference to San&#124;Bushman ethnography (written records of insights
        from San&#124;Bushman culture compiled by anthropologists).  Through the 1980s,
        interpretation of rock art was further developed, perhaps most significantly
        by David Lewis-Williams, a collaborator of Vinnicombe's. Lewis-Williams originated
        an approach to understanding San&#124;Bushman rock art which posits that the
        motivation and meaning for most, if not all, San&#124;Bushman rock art is
        based on the centrality of the spiritual leader or'shaman' and the shaman’s
        actions in San&#124;Bushman life and belief.  Over the past 30 years, the
        idea that much of San&#124;Bushman rock art is essentially ‘shamanistic’ in
        nature has been dominant in academic discourse.

      title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 9'
      body: "Shamanistic interpretations of San&#124;Bushman paintings and engravings
        draw on both past records of ‘Southern’ or /Xam San&#124;Bushman people living
        historically in South Africa and more recent ethnography based mainly on San&#124;Bushman
        communities in Namibia and Botswana, suggesting that their imagery illustrated
        and reinforced the power of the actions of shamans. Much of the imagery is
        proposed to reflect the shaman’s hallucinatory visions from the 'trance dance’,
        a tradition common to San&#124;Bushman groups where shamans enter a trance
        state during which they visit a 'spirit world' in which they may go on spiritual
        journeys or perform tasks on behalf of their communities. It is thought that
        the rock art panels may have acted as reservoirs for the 'potency' that shamans
        are considered to possess, with the rock face considered a veil between both
        worlds.  The images are thought to reflect trance experiences including those
        of 'therianthropes’, images of figures with both human and animal features,
        explained as shamans who in a trance state feel themselves transformed into
        animals.  Certain other poses and features found in San&#124;Bushman rock
        art, such as so-called 'entoptic' motifs—geometric shapes such as zigzags
        and dots—have also been interpreted as reflecting visions that shamans experience
        while in a trance state.  \n\nDiscussion continues around the extent of the
        applicability of 'shamanist' interpretations for all aspects of San&#124;Bushman
        art, with research ongoing and scholars also exploring the potential roles
        of other elements in rock art production, such as mythology or gender and
        initiation rites.  Other avenues of study include more regional foci, on specific
        cultural and temporal contexts and how the imagery may reflect local power
        dynamics through time.\n"

      body: 'Although the focus in South African rock art research has been on San&#124;Bushman
        art, research has also been done on other rock art traditions, suggesting
        different cultural origins.  For example, investigation of Northern Sotho
        rock art has shown much of it to have been created in relation to boys''and
        girls'' initiation ceremonies, while Bantu-language speakers''engravings of
        interlinked circle patterns have been interpreted as images of idealised conceptualised
        homesteads.  Work on attribution for some rock art of uncertain authorship
        also has been undertaken.  Certain geometric forms of rock engraving may be
        of Khoekhoen origin, possibly showing influence from central African geometric
        traditions and tracing historical migrations southwards.  It has also been
        suggested that some finger-painted images in the centre of the country are
        the early 19th century work of the Korana people, a group of mixed ancestry
        living as raiders on the Cape frontier and incorporating motifs from San&#124;Bushman
        and other traditions. '

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 11'
      body: "The earliest scientifically dated examples of clearly visible painted
        parietal art in South Africa comes from Steenbokfontein Cave in the Western
        Cape, where collapsed painted portions from the wall buried in sediment have
        been radiocarbon dated to at least 3,600 years ago, while in the Drakensberg,
        AMS dating carried out on the oxalate crust superimposing a painting of a
        human figure has suggested it to be at least 1,800 years old.  While it is
        thought that the beginnings of the painting tradition in the Drakensberg region
        are probably older than this, the relative lack of durability in paint means
        that many of the existing paintings were probably made sometime within the
        past few hundred years. Sometimes it is apparent when this is the case - several
        painting sites in this region show images of both San&#124;Bushman people
        and Europeans riding horses and bearing firearms, which dates them to within
        the past 350 years and particularly the 19th century.  Images of sheep and
        cattle also place images within the last 2,000 years.  \n\nThe oldest reliably
        dated evidence for deliberate engraving in the country is several ochre pieces
        incised with abstract patterns found in a buried layer in Blombos cave in
        the Western Cape and dated through a number of methods to between 70 and 100,000
        years ago.  The earliest known figurative engraving date from the country
        comes from a slab with an image of a portion of an animal on it, excavated
        from Wonderwerk Cave in the Northern Cape and dating from around 10,200 years
        ago.  Engravings remaining in the open are more difficult to date scientifically,
        and various attempts have been made to date and sequence both engravings and
        paintings based on style and superimposition, while recent years, work has
        been undertaken to apply the Harris Matrix (an archaeological sequencing technique
        for relative dating) method to painting chronologies in the Free State, Drakensberg
        and Western Cape.  This involves using techniques originally conceived for
        charting chronology in stratigraphic layering to compare and sequence different
        superimposed motifs.\n"
