      body: 'The proliferation of rock engravings at Twyfelfontein | /Ui-//aes in
        the north-west of central Namibia, forms the largest single grouping of ancient
        engraved images in southern Africa.  Covering about 57 hectares in the core
        area and home to over 2,000 engravings, the rock art sites are situated near
        a small but permanent spring. The site was first formally noted by Reinhard
        Maack in a 1921 report to the Administrator of South West Africa, following
        a report to him from a surveyor named Volkmann mentioning the engravings,
        near a spring Volkmann named as Uais (/Ui-//aes= place among rocks or jumping
        waterhole in Khoekhoegowab, the language of the local Damara people).  Later,
        the land came into the use of farmer David Levin, whose concern over the survival
        of the spring led ultimately to its being referred to as Twyfelfontein (‘doubtful
        spring’ in Afrikaans). In 1963 Ernst Scherz visited the site as part of his
        work to record rock art sites throughout South West Africa.  Scherz documented
        around 2,500 images in the wider valley area, while a 2005 survey of the core
        site found 2,075 individual images on 235 separate rock surfaces.  '

        surfaces at the base of a hill scarp within the basin of the ephemeral Huab
        River, while the few painted panels in the area are found on the underside
        of sandstone rock overhangs.  The engraved images are pecked and/or ground/polished
        and are made in a variety of styles, with ubiquitous geometric patterns of
        cross-hatched, looped and linear forms, as well as circles and polished depressions
        and cupules.  In addition there are numerous depictions of animals, ranging
        in style from more naturalistic to stylised and distorted.  Chief among the
        animal images is the giraffe, which is most numerous.  Also common are images
        of rhinoceroses, zebra, gemsbok antelope and ostriches.  There are occasional
        depictions of cattle but images of human beings are almost absent.  Also featured
        are images of human footprints and animal spoor (hoof and paw prints).

      body: The figurative images in the engraved art feature several different distinct
        styles, ranging from very naturalistic outlines of animals such as giraffes
        and rhinoceroses, through carefully delineated but stylised or distorted renditions
        of these animals with exaggerated extremities, to very schematic pecked outlines.  One
        particular aspect of style is a form of relief engraving, whereby in some
        deeply pecked figures' muscle masses are delineated.  In others, the infill
        pecking is graded and  sparser in the centre of a figure, giving the impression
        of shading.  A few of the engravings are highly polished.  Perhaps most renowned
        among these is the “dancing kudu” image, a stylised image of a kudu antelope
        cow rendered atop a flat slab of rock and surrounded by geometric shapes.

      title_internal: 'Namibia: featured site, chapter 4'
      body: "It appears that the kudu figure is pregnant and it has been suggested
        that the choice of this animal may have been made in relation to female initiation
        practices. This is because the female kudu has a symbolic importance relating
        to women’s behaviour in the cosmology of some San|Bushman¹ people, traditionally
        hunter-gatherer people whose ancestors are thought to have made most of southern
        Africa’s rock paintings and engravings.  Other animals known to have symbolic
        and metaphorical significance to San|Bushman people are also depicted here
        (giraffe images are most numerous) and these images have been interpreted
        in the vein of other southern African rock art sites, where images are thought
        to reflect the experiences of shamans while in a trance state, and may have
        multiple metaphorical and other cultural meanings.  \n\nThe engravings were
        certainly made in strategic locations and not simply on any available rock
        surface, with some images having been deliberately made in places that are
        difficult to reach and to see.  The reason for this is unclear, though it
        has been suggested that such placement might be in relation to the images
        serving a preparatory function for shamans preparing to enter a trance.  Some
        of the engravings have exaggerated features such as elongated limbs and extremities
        which may reflect trance experience.  One of the engravings appears to depict
        a lion with pugmarks (paw prints) instead of feet and third at the end of
        the tail.  Each of those in the feet have five instead of the correct four
        pads and this has been interpreted as meaning that the figure represents a
        human shaman in trance who has taken on lion form.  A similar suggestion has
        been made regarding the frequent depictions of ostriches (Kinahan, 2006).
        \ \n\n¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different
        hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages
        and cultural traditions. Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive
        terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted
        them.\n"

      body: "Such interpretations are made on the basis that the artists followed
        the same cultural tradition as the ancestral San|Bushman. The few examples
        of painted rock art at the site certainly appear to conform to the hunter-gatherer
        tradition found elsewhere in Namibia.   Following this approach, the geometric
        engraved forms may be interpreted as illustrative of so-called ‘entoptic’
        phenomena: shapes and patterns observed when entering a trance state, though
        an alternative origin for some of the geometrics with particular line and
        circle motifs has also been suggested. This proposal suggests that they were
        made by ancestral Khoenkhoen herder people, rather than hunter-gatherers,
        perhaps in relation to initiation practices.  \n\nAttempting to date or sequence
        the images based on superimpositioning or patina is difficult – superimposition
        of engravings at the site is rare and a range of patination colours seem to
        indicate these works having been created over a wide timescale, though it
        has been noted that a certain style of spoor images sometimes overlie some
        of the animal figures, indicating that this is a younger tradition.  Archaeological
        fieldwork around the site undertaken in 1968 by Erich Wendt recovered evidence
        of occupation including stone tools, worked ostrich eggshell and stone structures.
        \ The dates recovered from radiocarbon dating ranged widely from c.5,850-180
        BP (years before present).  The relationship between periods of occupation/site
        use and the production of rock art is not known, but based on archaeological
        evidence from around the wider area it is thought that engravings in the styles
        found at Twyfelfontein range from around 6,000 to around 1,000 years old,
        though some may be more recent.\n"

      body: "Rock art is found across the country from the southern border almost
        to the northern border, although rock art sites are scarce in the far north.
        \ The majority of known rock art sites are found in the rocky and mountainous
        areas forming the escarpment edge in the west of the country.  Particular
        concentrations of rock art are found in the west-centre of the country, north
        of the edge of the Namib’s coastal sand sea.  Namibia’s most well-known rock
        art locales are clustered in this area, among them the Brandberg (also known
        as Dâures) and Erongo mountains and the Spitzkoppe peaks, as well as the well-known
        engraved rock art complex at  Twyfelfontein | /Ui-//aes.  \n\nAround  20km
        wide, the almost circular granitic intrusion of the Brandberg contains Namibia’s
        highest point  at over 2,500 ft., and around 1,000 rock art sites, with around
        50,000 individual figures recorded. These include both paintings and engravings
        but paintings form the majority. The Erongo mountains, a similar but less
        compact formation around 120km to the south-east, contain a further 80 sites
        and 50km to the west of this, the Spitzkoppe peaks, a group of granite inselbergs,
        has a smaller concentration of known sites with 37 so far recorded.  Painting
        sites are most often found on vertical surfaces in rock shelters or the sides
        of granitic boulders,  while engravings may survive in more exposed environments
        such as on boulders, often dolerite or sandstone.   \n\nThe most well-known
        of the engraving sites is that of Twyfelfontein | /Ui-//aes, around 50 km
        north of the Brandberg. The rock art complex here is dominated by collections
        of engraved images, though some paintings are also present.  With well over
        2,000 individual images, the Twyfelfontein engravings form the largest known
        discrete collection of engraved rock art in Southern Africa.   \n"

        that of C. J. Andersson who mentioned “A strange tale of a rock in which the
        tracks of …animals are distinctly visible” in his 1856 book Lake Ngami.  Further
        reports came in the 1870s when the Reverend C. J. Büttner published an article
        in a South African periodical reporting rock art in the Erongo Mountains,
        while Commissioner William Coates Palgrave made a report of paintings near
        Dassiesfontein, along with some the earliest known photographs of rock art
        in Africa.  European public awareness of rock art from the region in Europe
        was spurred by the January 1910 publication of an article  by Oberleutnant
        Hugo Jochmann featuring images from various sites in a German magazine.  The  first
        monograph on the rock art of the area then known as South West Africa was
        published in 1930 (Obermaier & Kühn, 1930), following further reports by officials,
        including the explorer and geographer Reinhardt Maack, who in a 1921 report
        first noted the existence of engravings at Twyfelfontein.  '

      body: "During the course of an earlier expedition, Maack had stumbled upon a
        singular painting in a Brandberg rock shelter. This image came to be well-known
        as the ‘White Lady’ of the Brandberg, after the renowned rock art researcher
        the Abbé Henri Breuil, who saw Maack’s copy of it and took a keen interest
        in the image. Eventually Breuil published a lavishly illustrated volume on
        the White Lady in 1955, which made it one of the most famous rock painting
        images in the world.  During the 1940s and 50s Breuil also explored and published
        on rock art sites elsewhere in the Brandberg and Erongo mountains.  \n\nErnst
        Scherz, who had acted as a guide for Breuil, would go on to conduct extensive
        documentation work throughout the country as part of  the comprehensive research
        project investigating the archaeology of South West Africa run by the University
        of Cologne and sponsored by the Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft.  Beginning
        in 1963, this resulted in the publications of Scherz’s three-volume opus *Felsbilder
        in Sudwest-Afrika* in 1970, 1975 and 1986, containing site by site descriptions
        and classifications of painting and engraving sites throughout modern Namibia,
        along with discussion of theme and context.  The Cologne programme also supported
        the work of several other researchers, including the designer and artist Harald
        Pager, whose meticulous work recording rock paintings in South Africa’s Drakensberg
        had already gained him recognition in the field of rock art research. From
        1977, Pager began a seven year project of recording painted rock art sites
        in the Brandberg, documenting around 43,000 individual images.  Pager’s corpus
        has been organised by Tilman Lenssen-Erz and published posthumously in the
        six-volume   *Rock Paintings of the Upper Brandberg*, as a result of which
        the Brandberg is one of the most comprehensively documented rock art regions
        on earth.\n"

      title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 8'
      body: "Much of the painted rock art in Namibia may be broadly compared to the
        wider hunter-gatherer rock art oeuvre found throughout southern Africa, similar
        in theme and composition and believed to be a part of the same general tradition,
        which is generally attributed to San|Bushman¹ people and their ancestors.
        \ Imagery includes scenes of human figures carrying bows and other implements,
        wild animals and unidentified shapes in different pigments.  Overall, human
        figures dominate in the paintings of Namibia, making up more than 2/3 of the
        painted figures, and where the gender can be recognised, they are more commonly
        male than female.  Prominent painting subjects and styles in the rock art
        of Namibia (particularly the best-studied west-central region) include, at
        some sites, clearly delineated dots and patterns on human figures, a particular
        tradition of showing human figures with voluminous decorated hairstyles, and
        more images of giraffe and kudu, gemsbok and springbok antelope than in other
        southern African regions.  Other images of animals include those of zebras,
        elephants, rhinoceros and ostriches.  More occasional motifs found include
        plants, cattle, sheep and handprints. \n\n¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term
        used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in
        southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions. Both 'San'
        and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups,
        although others have positively adopted them."

        while others are entirely monochrome.   While the majority of rock  paintings
        in Namibia seem to conform to the hunter-gatherer style, there are also some
        examples of finger paintings in the Brandberg and northern Namibia, which
        are much more schematic in style and appear to belong to a different tradition
        altogether.  \n\nAs with much southern African rock art, the colours visible
        today may not always accurately reflect the original look as some pigments.
        \ This is particularly true for those used for pale colours or white, which
        may be ‘fugitive’, meaning that over time they fade or wash away faster than
        the more stable pigments around them, leaving gaps which were once coloured.
        \ Chemical analyses have shown that a major binder (used to coalesce dry pigment
        powder) for painted rock art in Namibia was blood, and in some cases egg white.

        engravings, like paintings, feature animal figures heavily, with images of
        ostriches more common than those in paintings, there is a comparative dearth
        of engraved human figures.  There is also less obvious interaction between
        individual engraved figures in the form of ‘scenes’ than in paintings, but
        instead more isolated individuals scattered on rock surfaces. Engraved rock
        art in Namibia also features a particular preponderance of  images of spoor
        (animal hoof or paw prints).  Some of these engravings are very naturalistic
        and may be identified by species whereas others, such as some showing human
        footprints, can be quite schematic.  In addition, many engravings are geometric
        in nature.   '

      title: Interpretation
      title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 11'
      body: "Namibian rock paintings, and most engravings, have largely been interpreted
        in the vein largely espoused by  researchers over the past 30 years.  This
        postulates that much of this rock art reflects the experience of San|Bushman
        shamans entering trance states and that rather than being scenes from daily
        life, the depictions of animals and activities are highly symbolic within
        San|Bushman cosmology, with images acting as reservoirs of spiritual power.
        \ This avenue of interpretation originates largely from the study of rock
        art in South Africa and Lesotho.  While it appears broadly applicable here,
        the fact that direct attributions to known cultural groups in this area are
        difficult somewhat hinders direct comparisons with Namibian rock art.  While
        hunter-gatherer rock painting production in South Africa was practiced until
        the recent past, it appears to have ceased in Namibia around a thousand  years
        ago and modern San|Bushman groups in the Kalahari area have no tradition of
        rock art production.   \n\nAdditionally, hundreds of miles and different geographical
        environments separate the rock art centres of north-western Namibia from those
        in neighbouring countries. This is particularly apparent in the differences
        in terms of animal subject matter, with the numerous depictions of gemsbok
        and springbok, explicable by the rock art creators being semi-desert dwellers
        where gemsbok and springbok are found locally though largely absent from rock
        art elsewhere in southern Africa, where these animals are not found. \n"

      body: "Other differences are found in style and emphasis: the frequency with
        which giraffe feature in Namibian paintings and engravings contrasts with
        the South African rock art, where the emphasis is more on the eland antelope.
        \ This has led some to propose that the giraffe, similarly, must have held
        a particular symbolic meaning for the painters of the region.  Based on associated
        imagery, placement of the rock art sites, and some ethnography (written records
        of insights from contemporary San|Bushman culture compiled by anthropologists)
        it has been suggested that giraffes may have been linked with rain in local
        belief systems, with some Namibian rock painting sites are associated specifically
        with rainmaking or healing activities. \n\nWhile the more naturalistic examples
        of engravings are thought to have also been produced by ancient hunter-gatherers,
        as with the paintings, it has been suggested that some geometric engravings
        were produced  by herding people, possibly ancestral Khoenkhoen, perhaps in
        relation to initiation rites.  Schematic finger paintings have also been attributed
        to pastoralist people.  All attributions are tentative, however, because the
        majority of the art is thought to be many hundreds of years old and the historical
        distinctions between hunter-gatherers and herders is by no means clear-cut
        in the archaeological record.\n"

      title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 13'
      body: "The pieces from the cave Wendt excavated (named ‘Apollo 11 Cave’ after
        the moon mission which took place during the period of the excavation work)
        are not thought to have fallen from a cave wall but were made on loose rock
        pieces.  The only parietal art (on a fixed rock surface) dated from excavated
        deposits in Namiba so far consists of pieces of painted granite from the largest
        painted shelter in the Brandberg, one of which, found in a sedimentary layer
        radiocarbon dated to around 2,700 years ago, had clearly fallen from an exposed
        rock surface into which researchers were able to refit it. Aside from this,
        estimates at the age of rock art are based on superimposition, patination
        and associated archaeological finds. \n\nBased on archaeological evidence,
        it is thought that the majority of the fine-line hunter-gatherer rock art
        in the Brandberg area was produced between around 4,000 and 2,000 years ago,
        with the painting tradition in the wider region starting as much as 6,000
        years ago. This ceased sometime after the introduction of small domestic stock
        to the area, although not immediately, as fine-line paintings of sheep and
        paintings and engravings of cattle testify.   Across central Namibia, there
        appears to be a particularly strong correspondence of finds relating to paintings—such
        as grinding equipment and pigments—with dated layers from the 1st millennium
        BC.\n"

        monochrome tableaux appear older than detailed polychrome depictions of individuals,

        late.  Among engravings of central Namibia, a certain style of hoof print
