        is currently one of the three that can be visited and is open to the public.  Unlike
        many of the other sites, which are grouped together, the Namzeze shelter is
        isolated in the centre of the protected area.  Located in a position overlooking
        the valley towards the Chongoni Hill, the impressive rock face of Namzeze
        contains some of the best examples of both traditions of Malawian rock art,
        the red schematic and white paintings.  The site also has a strong symbolism
        for the Chewa people who still inhabit the area and for whom the white paintings
        of the later period still have deep spiritual implications. '

      body: "The superimpositions in the panel above show that the red, schematic
        paintings covering most of the rock face are undoubtedly older than those
        made in white.  Representations include a multitude of geometric signs: series
        of parallel lines, grid-style shapes, concentric ovals and circular shapes
        made with series of dots.  In some cases the red signs were infilled with
        series of tiny white dots, a feature uncommon in the red schematic rock art
        depictions but with the best examples represented here in Namzeze.  Its interpretation,
        as with most geometric depictions, is a challenging issue, but these types
        of paintings have been traditionally related to ancestors of  Batwa people,
        hunter-gatherers, who inhabited the region until the 1800s.  Studies of Batwa
        ethnography and cosmology point to these places as related to fertility and
        rainmaking ceremonies.  It is difficult to establish the chronology.  The
        oldest occupation documented in the region is dated to the mid-first millennium
        BC, and the red images precede the arrival of the Chewa people in the 2nd
        millennium AD, responsible for the white paintings style, but there is no
        datable evidence for the paintings.  \n"

      body: The second type of painting found in Namzeze is radically different and
        depicts mainly quadrupeds and birds, as well as some geometric symbols and
        a car, proof of a relatively recent date for some of these paintings. Quadrupeds
        have a very characteristic rectangular body and hooves that in some cases
        are represented as feet.  The technique is very different too, consisting
        of white clay daubed on the wall with the fingers.  These white figures usually
        appear surrounding the previous depictions, in some rare occasions overlapping
        them.  In this case, the authorship, chronology and interpretation of the
        paintings are more straightforward.  Researchers agree that these types of
        paintings have been made by the Chewa, a group of farmers that arrived to
        the region around the 16th century and have maintained rock art painting traditions
        until the 20th century (as the car represented in this shelter proves).

      body: 'Regarding the interpretation of the paintings, they are directly related
        to the *nyau*, a secret society of the Chewa and other neighbouring groups
        in Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique which plays a significant role in funerary
        and girl’s initiation ceremonies.  The *nyau* rituals include dancing and
        rely heavily on the use of masks, including face masks as well as other mobile
        structures carried by one or two people.  These masks are central for the
        *nyau* secret society and are kept in secret, hidden from non-initiates.  The
        white paintings of Namzeze and many other sites have been interpreted as representations
        of masks, depicted during initiation ceremonies that took place in these isolated
        shelters where secrets of the *nyau* were explained to the new initiates.  '

      body: "In fact, some of the more than 100 types of masks can be easily identified
        in the rock shelters.  The most common is the *kasiyamaliro*, a big structure
        representing an antelope, with a rectangular shape and meant to be carried
        by two people (an [excellent example](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=472359&partId=1)
        can be seen in Room 25 in the British Museum), but others, such as the *Galimoto*
        (a car structure) and birds are also documented.  Some of the features of
        the animals depicted in this panel corroborate with this interpretation: the
        shape of the hooves which is more similar to feet, and the fact that in some
        cases the feet of the forelegs and the hind legs are facing each other, as
        if they corresponded to two different people. Some researchers have interpreted
        this feature as a pictorial tool to teach people the proper way of wearing
        and using the structure to avoid stumbling, which would expose the men hidden
        in the structure and thus the secret of the mask would be revealed.  \n"

        very specific period of time (before that other styles of white paintings
        were used), when the secret society was persecuted first by Ngoni invaders
        in the 19th century, then by missionaries and colonial governments in the
        20th century. With their traditional practices and places forbidden, the members
        of this society had to look for alternative ways to teach the secrets of the
        secret society secrets, with the paintings starting to represent *nyau* objects,
        to be used as a didactic tool.  The Namzeze paintings show very explicitly
        the adaptability of societies to their different challenges and historical
        contexts. Either as a tool to summon the rain or as a coded message to transmit
        sacred secrets, the painted symbols depicted in Namzeze show the incredible
        complexity of rock art meanings throughout time, and their importance for
        the communities that painted them.  \n"

        Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. It stretches from north to south with the
        eastern boundary of the country marked by the Lake Malawi. Rock art can be
        found throughout the country but is especially abundant in central Malawi,
        near the western border with Mozambique. It consists exclusively of paintings
        attributed to two very distinctive groups (hunter-gatherers and farmers),
        and shows obvious links with other sites located in Zambia and western Mozambique.
        The images consist mainly of animals, anthropomorphic figures and geometric
        symbols, with a chronology that ranges from the Late Stone Age to the 1950s.

        of sites is located in the Chongoni area, in the westernmost part of central
        Malawi, very near the border with Mozambique. In that area around 150 rock
        art sites have been located so far, belonging to the two main traditions of
        rock art found in the country. Other smaller concentrations of rock art can
        be found to the south and to the north-west, and around the southern side
        of Lake Malawi. The distribution of the different styles of Malawian rock
        art varies substantially: while the older paintings attributed to hunter-gatherers
        can be found everywhere throughout the country, those made by farmers are
        concentrated in the Chongoni area, as well as nearby areas of Mozambique and
        Zambia. Rock art is usually scattered throughout the landscape, in hilly areas
        where gneiss outcrops provide shelters and well-protected surfaces adequate
        for painting.  '

      body: 'Rock art in Malawi has been documented by Europeans since at least the
        1920s, although it wasn’t until the 1950s when the first articles on the subject
        were published, and it was only in 1978 a first synthesis on Malawian rock
        art was undertaken (Lindgren, N.E.  & Schoffeleers, J.M. 1978). In the 1980s
        research increased, especially on Chongoni rock art as its importance as a
        secret society artefact became evident. In 1995 the Chongoni rock art area
        was comprehensively studied by Benjamin Smith as a part of his doctoral research
        (1995), which is still the main reference on the topic. Most of the research
        on Malawi rock art has focused on the study of the two different painting
        traditions found in Malawi. A basic proposal was made in 1978 when the red
        paintings—mostly geometric—considered older and attributed to hunter-gatherers,
        while white paintings were related to more modern groups of farmers which
        arrived early in the 2nd millennium AD and preserved their painting traditions
        until the 1950s. Since 1978, the knowledge of these two groups has substantially
        improved, with a more refined proposal made by Benjamin Smith in his doctoral
        dissertation.  '

        These paintings are associated with the ancestors of modern Batwa hunter-gatherers,
        and can be classified into two different types. The first can be considered
        the most characteristic and is represented by circles with radiating lines,
        concentric circles, ovals, wavy or parallel lines. In some cases, red figures
        are infilled in white painting or white dots. The second type is very scarce
        (only two examples have been found in Chongoni) and depicts very schematic
        animals, sometimes accompanied by humans. Both types are finely executed with
        red oxide pigment. Regarding their interpretation, the figures seem to have
        been associated with rainmaking and fertility concepts. '

      body: 'The second and more modern rock art tradition found in Malawi is represented
        by white figures made with white clay daubed onto rock surfaces with the finger.
        Associated with the agriculturalist Chewa people, the depictions usually represent
        zoomorphic, spread-eagled or snake-like figures which could represent mythological
        beings, sometimes accompanied by geometric symbols.  As in the case of the
        schematic figures, two types of paintings have been proposed: those related
        to spread-eagled figures and those representing zoomorphs (animal-like figures).
        The paintings were made until several decades ago, as testified by depictions
        of cars that can be found at some sites. In this case, the interpretation
        of the paintings is straightforward, as the images depicted can still be related
        to current rituals often employing masks in a variety of shapes.  The spread-eagled
        paintings may be associated with a Chewa girl’s initiation ceremony and would
        act as a mnemonic tool during the ritual, while the zoomorphic paintings may
        depict spirit characters of the Chewa men’s secret society, the *nyau*. In
        many cases, these paintings can overlap the older red paintings already existing
        at some sites'
