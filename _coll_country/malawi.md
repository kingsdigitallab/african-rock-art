        is currently one of the three that can be visited and is open to the public.  Unlike
        many of the other sites, which are grouped together, the Namzeze shelter is
        isolated in the centre of the protected area.  Located in a position overlooking
        the valley towards the Chongoni Hill, the impressive rock face of Namzeze
        contains some of the best examples of both traditions of Malawian rock art,
        the red schematic and white paintings.  The site also has a strong symbolism
        for the Chewa people who still inhabit the area and for whom the white paintings
        of the later period still have deep spiritual implications. '

      body: "The superimpositions in the panel above show that the red, schematic
        paintings covering most of the rock face are undoubtedly older than those
        made in white.  Representations include a multitude of geometric signs: series
        of parallel lines, grid-style shapes, concentric ovals and circular shapes
        made with series of dots.  In some cases the red signs were infilled with
        series of tiny white dots, a feature uncommon in the red schematic rock art
        depictions but with the best examples represented here in Namzeze.  Its interpretation,
        as with most geometric depictions, is a challenging issue, but these types
        of paintings have been traditionally related to ancestors of  Batwa people,
        hunter-gatherers, who inhabited the region until the 1800s.  Studies of Batwa
        ethnography and cosmology point to these places as related to fertility and
        rainmaking ceremonies.  It is difficult to establish the chronology.  The
        oldest occupation documented in the region is dated to the mid-first millennium
        BC, and the red images precede the arrival of the Chewa people in the 2nd
        millennium AD, responsible for the white paintings style, but there is no
        datable evidence for the paintings.  \n"

      body: The second type of painting found in Namzeze is radically different and
        depicts mainly quadrupeds and birds, as well as some geometric symbols and
        a car, proof of a relatively recent date for some of these paintings. Quadrupeds
        have a very characteristic rectangular body and hooves that in some cases
        are represented as feet.  The technique is very different too, consisting
        of white clay daubed on the wall with the fingers.  These white figures usually
        appear surrounding the previous depictions, in some rare occasions overlapping
        them.  In this case, the authorship, chronology and interpretation of the
        paintings are more straightforward.  Researchers agree that these types of
        paintings have been made by the Chewa, a group of farmers that arrived to
        the region around the 16th century and have maintained rock art painting traditions
        until the 20th century (as the car represented in this shelter proves).

      body: 'Regarding the interpretation of the paintings, they are directly related
        to the *nyau*, a secret society of the Chewa and other neighbouring groups
        in Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique which plays a significant role in funerary
        and girl’s initiation ceremonies.  The *nyau* rituals include dancing and
        rely heavily on the use of masks, including face masks as well as other mobile
        structures carried by one or two people.  These masks are central for the
        *nyau* secret society and are kept in secret, hidden from non-initiates.  The
        white paintings of Namzeze and many other sites have been interpreted as representations
        of masks, depicted during initiation ceremonies that took place in these isolated
        shelters where secrets of the *nyau* were explained to the new initiates.  '

      body: "In fact, some of the more than 100 types of masks can be easily identified
        in the rock shelters.  The most common is the *kasiyamaliro*, a big structure
        representing an antelope, with a rectangular shape and meant to be carried
        by two people (an [excellent example](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=472359&partId=1)
        can be seen in Room 25 in the British Museum), but others, such as the *Galimoto*
        (a car structure) and birds are also documented.  Some of the features of
        the animals depicted in this panel corroborate with this interpretation: the
        shape of the hooves which is more similar to feet, and the fact that in some
        cases the feet of the forelegs and the hind legs are facing each other, as
        if they corresponded to two different people. Some researchers have interpreted
        this feature as a pictorial tool to teach people the proper way of wearing
        and using the structure to avoid stumbling, which would expose the men hidden
        in the structure and thus the secret of the mask would be revealed.  \n"

        very specific period of time (before that other styles of white paintings
        were used), when the secret society was persecuted first by Ngoni invaders
        in the 19th century, then by missionaries and colonial governments in the
        20th century. With their traditional practices and places forbidden, the members
        of this society had to look for alternative ways to teach the secrets of the
        secret society secrets, with the paintings starting to represent *nyau* objects,
        to be used as a didactic tool.  The Namzeze paintings show very explicitly
        the adaptability of societies to their different challenges and historical
        contexts. Either as a tool to summon the rain or as a coded message to transmit
        sacred secrets, the painted symbols depicted in Namzeze show the incredible
        complexity of rock art meanings throughout time, and their importance for
        the communities that painted them.  \n"

      title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 1'
      body: |-
        Central Africa is dominated by vast river systems and lakes, particularly the Congo River Basin. Characterised by hot and wet weather on both sides of the equator, central Africa has no regular dry season, but aridity increases in intensity both north and south of the equator. Covered with a forest of about 400,000 m² (1,035,920 km²), it is one of the greenest parts of the continent.  The rock art of central Africa stretches from the Zambezi River to the Angolan Atlantic coast and reaches as far north as Cameroon and Uganda. Termed the ‘schematic rock art zone’ by Desmond Clark (1959), it is dominated by finger-painted geometric motifs and designs, thought to extend back many thousands of years.

        Eastern Africa, from the Zambezi River Valley to Lake Turkana, consists largely of a vast inland plateau with the highest elevations on the continent, such as Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m above sea level) and Mount Kenya (5,199 m above sea level). Twin parallel rift valleys run through the region, which includes the world’s second largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria. The climate is atypical of an equatorial region, being cool and dry due to the high altitude and monsoon winds created by the Ethiopian Highlands. The rock art of eastern Africa is concentrated on this plateau and consists mainly of paintings that include animal and human representations. Found mostly in central Tanzania, eastern Zambia and Malawi; in comparison to the widespread distribution of geometric rock art, this figurative tradition is much more localised, and found at just a few hundred sites in a region of less than 100km in diameter.

        The rock art of East Africa, in particular the red paintings from Tanzania, was extensively studied by Mary and Louis Leakey in the 1930s and 1950s. Eric Ten Raa observed Sandawe people of Tanzania making rock paintings in the mid-20th century, and on the basis of oral traditions argued that the rock art was made for three main purposes: casual art; magic art (for hunting purposes or connected to health and fertility) and sacrificial art (to appease ancestral spirits). Subsequently, during the 1970s Fidelis Masao and Emmanuel Anati recorded numerous sites, classifying the art in broad chronological and stylistic categories, proposing tentative interpretations with regard to meaning.

        There has much debate and uncertainty about Central African rock art.  The history of the region has seen much mobility and interaction of cultural groups and understanding how the rock art relates to particular groups has been problematic. Pioneering work in this region was undertaken by Margaret Metcalfe in central Malawi in the early 1920s, Clarence van Riet Lowe visited Zambia in 1936 and attempted to provide a chronological sequence and some insight into the meaning of the rock art. Since the 1950s (Clarke, 1959), archaeologists have attempted to situate rock art within broader archaeological frameworks in order to resolve chronologies, and to categorise the art with reference to style, colour, superimposition, subject matter, weathering, and positioning of depictions within the panel (Phillipson, 1976). Building on this work, our current understanding of rock in this region has been advanced by Benjamin Smith (1995, 1997, 2001) with his work in Zambia and Malawi.

      body: "Rock art of East Africa consists mainly of paintings, most of which are
        found in central Tanzania, and are fewer in number in eastern Zambia and Malawi;
        scholars have categorised them as follows:\n\n*__Red Paintings__*:  \nRed
        paintings can be sub-divided into those found in central Tanzania and those
        found stretching from Zambia to the Indian Ocean.\nTanzanian red paintings
        include large, naturalistic animals with occasional geometric motifs. The
        giraffe is the most frequently painted animal, but antelope, zebra, elephant,
        rhino, felines and ostrich are also depicted. Later images show figures with
        highly distinctive stylised human head forms or hairstyles and body decoration,
        sometimes in apparent hunting and domestic scenes. The Sandawe and Hadza,
        hunter-gatherer groups, indigenous to north-central and central Tanzania respectively,
        claim their ancestors were responsible for some of the later art.\n\nThe area
        in which Sandawe rock art is found is less than 100km in diameter and occurs
        at just a few hundred sites, but corresponds closely to the known distribution
        of this group. There have been some suggestions that Sandawe were making rock
        art early into the 20th century, linking the art to particular rituals, in
        particular simbo; a trance dance in which the Sandawe communicate with the
        spirit world by taking on the power of an animal. The art displays a range
        of motifs and postures, features that can be understood by reference to simbo
        and to trance experiences; such as groups of human figures bending at the
        waist (which occurs during the *simbo* dance), taking on animal features such
        as ears and tails, and floating or flying; reflecting the experiences of those
        possessed in the dance."

      body: "Zambian rock art does not share any similarities with Tanzanian rock
        art and can be divided into two categories; animals (with a few depictions
        of humans), and geometric motifs. Animals are often highly stylised and superimposed
        with rows of dots. Geometric designs include, circles, some of which have
        radiating lines, concentric circles, parallel lines and ladder shapes. Predominantly
        painted in red, the remains of white pigment is still often visible. David
        Phillipson (1976) proposed that the naturalistic animals were earlier in date
        than geometric designs. Building on Phillipson’s work, Benjamin Smith studied
        ethnographic records and demonstrated that geometric motifs were made by women
        or controlling the weather.\n\n*__Pastoralist paintings__*: \nPastoralist
        paintings are rare, with only a few known sites in Kenya and other possible
        sites in Malawi. Usually painted in black, white and grey, but also in other
        colours, they include small outlines, often infilled, of cattle and are occasional
        accompanied by geometric motifs. Made during the period from 3,200 to 1,800
        years ago the practice ceased after Bantu language speaking people had settled
        in eastern Africa. Similar paintings are found in Ethiopia but not in southern
        Africa, and it has been assumed that these were made by Cushitic or Nilotic
        speaking groups, but their precise attribution remains unclear (Smith, 2013:154).\n"

        *__Late White Paintings__*:
        Commonly painted in white, or off-white with the fingers, so-called ‘Late White’ depictions include quite large crudely rendered representations of wild animals, mythical animals, human figures and numerous geometric motifs. These paintings are attributed to Bantu language speaking, iron-working farmers who entered eastern Africa about 2,000 years ago from the west on the border of Nigeria and Cameroon. Moving through areas occupied by the Batwa it is thought they learned the use of symbols painted on rock, skin, bark cloth and in sand. Chewa peoples, Bantu language speakers who live in modern day Zambia and Malawi claim their ancestors made many of the more recent paintings which they used in rites of passage ceremonies.

        *__Meat-feasting paintings__*:
        Meat-feasting shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle. The term Maa relates to a group of closely related Eastern Nilotic languages, which historically dominated the east African hinterland; and today is spoken by around a million people. During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners, but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease. Different symbols may be used for male and female animals. Over the centuries, because the depictions are on the ceiling of meat feasting rock shelters, and because sites are used even today, a build-up of soot has obscured or obliterated the paintings. Unfortunately, few have been recorded or mapped.

      title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 7'
      body: The rock art of central Africa is attributed to hunter-gatherers known
        as Batwa. This term is used widely in eastern central and southern Africa
        to denote any autochthonous hunter-gatherer people. The rock art of the Batwa
        can be divided into two categories which are quite distinctive stylistically
        from the Tanzanian depictions of the Sandawe and Hadza. Nearly 3,000 sites
        are currently known from within this area. The vast majority, around 90%,
        consist of finger-painted geometric designs; the remaining 10% include highly
        stylised animal forms (with a few human figures) and rows of finger dots.
        Both types are thought to date back many thousands of years. The two traditions
        co-occur over a vast area of eastern and central Africa and while often found
        in close proximity to each other are only found together at a few sites. However,
        it is the dominance of geometric motifs that make this rock art tradition
        very distinctive from other regions in Africa.

      body: "The Horn of Africa has historically been a crossroads area between the
        Eastern Sahara, the Subtropical regions to the South and the Arabic Peninsula.
        These mixed influences can be seen in many archaeological and historical features
        throughout the region, the rock art being no exception. Since the early stages
        of research in the 1930s, a strong relationship between the rock art in Ethiopia
        and the Arabian Peninsula was detected, leading to the establishment of the
        term *Ethiopian-Arabian* rock art by Pavel Červiček in 1971. This research
        thread proposes a progressive evolution from naturalism to schematism, ranging
        from the 4th-3rd millennium BC to the near past. Although the *Ethiopian-Arabian*
        proposal is still widely accepted and stylistic similarities between the rock
        art of Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen or Saudi Arabia are undeniable, recent voices
        have been raised against the term because of its excessive generalisation
        and lack of operability. In addition, recent research to the south of Ethiopia
        have started to discover new rock art sites related to those found in Uganda
        and Kenya.\n\nRegarding the main themes of the Horn of Africa rock art, cattle
        depictions seem to have been paramount, with cows and bulls depicted either
        isolated or in herds, frequently associated with ritual scenes which show
        their importance in these communities. Other animals – zebus, camels, felines,
        dogs, etc. –  are also represented, as well as rows of human figures, and
        fighting scenes between warriors or against lions. Geometric symbols are also
        common, usually associated with other depictions; and in some places they
        have been interpreted as tribal or clan marks. Both engraving and painting
        is common in most regions, with many regional variations. \n"

        Rock art in the Horn of Africa faces several challenges. One of them is the lack of consolidated chronologies and absolute dating for the paintings and engravings. Another is the uneven knowledge of rock art throughout the region, with research often affected by political unrest. Therefore, distributions of rock art in the region are steadily growing as research is undertaken in one of the most interactive areas in East Africa.

        The rock art of Central and East Africa is one of the least documented and well understood of the corpus of African rock art. However, in recent years scholars have undertaken some comprehensive reviews of existing sites and surveys of new sites to open up the debates and more fully understand the complexities of this region.

        Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. It stretches from north to south with the
        eastern boundary of the country marked by the Lake Malawi. Rock art can be
        found throughout the country but is especially abundant in central Malawi,
        near the western border with Mozambique. It consists exclusively of paintings
        attributed to two very distinctive groups (hunter-gatherers and farmers),
        and shows obvious links with other sites located in Zambia and western Mozambique.
        The images consist mainly of animals, anthropomorphic figures and geometric
        symbols, with a chronology that ranges from the Late Stone Age to the 1950s.

        Malawi, very near the border with Mozambique. In that area around 150 rock

        rock art found in the country. Other smaller concentrations of rock art can
        be found to the south and to the north-west, and around the southern side

        art varies substantially: while the older paintings attributed to hunter-gatherers
        can be found everywhere throughout the country, those made by farmers are
        concentrated in the Chongoni area, as well as nearby areas of Mozambique and
        Zambia. Rock art is usually scattered throughout the landscape, in hilly areas
        where gneiss outcrops provide shelters and well-protected surfaces adequate

        1920s, although it wasn’t until the 1950s when the first articles on the subject
        were published, and it was only in 1978 a first synthesis on Malawian rock
        art was undertaken (Lindgren, N.E.  & Schoffeleers, J.M. 1978). In the 1980s
        research increased, especially on Chongoni rock art as its importance as a
        secret society artefact became evident. In 1995 the Chongoni rock art area
        was comprehensively studied by Benjamin Smith as a part of his doctoral research
        (1995), which is still the main reference on the topic. Most of the research
        on Malawi rock art has focused on the study of the two different painting
        traditions found in Malawi. A basic proposal was made in 1978 when the red
        paintings—mostly geometric—considered older and attributed to hunter-gatherers,
        while white paintings were related to more modern groups of farmers which
        arrived early in the 2nd millennium AD and preserved their painting traditions
        until the 1950s. Since 1978, the knowledge of these two groups has substantially
        improved, with a more refined proposal made by Benjamin Smith in his doctoral
        dissertation.  '

        These paintings are associated with the ancestors of modern Batwa hunter-gatherers,
        and can be classified into two different types. The first can be considered
        the most characteristic and is represented by circles with radiating lines,
        concentric circles, ovals, wavy or parallel lines. In some cases, red figures
        are infilled in white painting or white dots. The second type is very scarce
        (only two examples have been found in Chongoni) and depicts very schematic
        animals, sometimes accompanied by humans. Both types are finely executed with
        red oxide pigment. Regarding their interpretation, the figures seem to have
        been associated with rainmaking and fertility concepts. '

      body: 'The second and more modern rock art tradition found in Malawi is represented
        by white figures made with white clay daubed onto rock surfaces with the finger.
        Associated with the agriculturalist Chewa people, the depictions usually represent
        zoomorphic, spread-eagled or snake-like figures which could represent mythological
        beings, sometimes accompanied by geometric symbols.  As in the case of the
        schematic figures, two types of paintings have been proposed: those related
        to spread-eagled figures and those representing zoomorphs (animal-like figures).
        The paintings were made until several decades ago, as testified by depictions
        of cars that can be found at some sites. In this case, the interpretation
        of the paintings is straightforward, as the images depicted can still be related
        to current rituals often employing masks in a variety of shapes.  The spread-eagled
        paintings may be associated with a Chewa girl’s initiation ceremony and would
        act as a mnemonic tool during the ritual, while the zoomorphic paintings may
        depict spirit characters of the Chewa men’s secret society, the *nyau*. In
        many cases, these paintings can overlap the older red paintings already existing
