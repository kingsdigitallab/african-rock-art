      body: A significant concentration of rock art in Mauritania is in the region
        of Guilemsi, an 11-km long ridge, about 70 m high at its highest point. Guilemsi
        is located in the desert, around 50 km north of the town of Tidjika, and about
        200 km west of the renowned Neolithic sites at Dhar Tichitt. Guilemsi’s south
        face contains many ravines with rock shelters, and the rock painting sites
        scattered around the area are to be found in open shelters and ridges or boulders
        on the cliff faces, as well as on the stone banks of a dry river. These sites
        are notable both for the solely painted nature of the rock art, and the variety
        of its subject matter.

      body: There are many stone constructions at Guilemsi that have been known to
        archaeologists for decades, although they have not received the academic attention
        that those further to the East in the Tichitt-Walata region had. The Dhars
        Tagant, Tichitt, Walata and Néma form an enormous crescent-shaped chain of
        sandstone escarpments, enclosing much of southern Mauritania and associated
        with a Neolithic ‘Tichitt Tradition’, which is based on the remains of over
        400 apparent settlements along the escarpment ridges. This culture is thought
        to have existed between about 2,000 BC and 200 BC, based on pastoralism and
        the cultivation of millet, before declining due to the increasing aridity
        of the environment and possible incursion by other cultural groups from the
        North.

      body: The Tichitt Tradition is characterised by dry stonewall remains, and these
        are found at Guilemsi, although the extent of the connection with the Tichitt
        culture to the East is unclear. The ridge at Guilemsi contains many apparent
        funerary monuments consisting of rectangular stone platforms, as well as apparent
        dwelling structures. Some of the funerary monuments appear to be associated
        with rock shelters, but any connection of the stone structures to the rock
        art remains unknown.

      body: The rock art at Guilemsi appears to be all painted, which marks a contrast
        to Tichitt sites which more often feature engraved rock art. The only non-painted
        rock markings encountered at Guilemsi was several groups of cupules (round,
        man-made depressions in the rock) which were found in three rock shelters.
        Some of the paintings in the area are unusual in themselves- one of the most
        striking is a panel of handprints in red (Fig. 4.), as well as a couple of
        rare paintings appearing to be of big cats, and the heads and finely rendered
        horns of seven antelope, perhaps oryx (Fig. 5.).

        naturalistic cow with dramatically elongated legs, next to an artificially
        inflated-looking human figure (Fig. 8). Domestic cattle were present in the
        area from at least the second Millennium BC, so these paintings must post-date
        this, although whether they are associated with Tichitt-Tradition pastoralists
        or later groups is not known. The fact that even the more normally-proportioned
        cattle representations at Guilemsi are depicted in a variety of styles (Figs.

        contemporary) painting by peoples with different stylistic traditions.'

      body: 'Two of the most impressive panels of paintings from Guilemsi involve
        not cattle but another important domesticate: ridden horses. There is evidence
        of horses having reached the far West of North Africa by about 600 AD, but
        horses may have been used in the area much earlier, from the mid-1st Millennium
        BC, if not earlier. Although elsewhere in the Sahara the earliest horse images
        appear to show them used for draught purposes rather than riding, in Mauritania,
        almost all depictions of horses in rock art show them being ridden, often
        by apparently armed riders (eg. Fig. 11). At Guilemsi, there are several styles
        of paintings showing horses and riders: the ‘bi-triangular’ and stick-figure
        like styles (Figs. 10 & 11), which have been proposed to be associated with
        early Berber peoples, and another style, showing horses with elongated, stylised
        bodies and short necks (Fig. 9). These horse depictions appear to be of a
        form thus far unrecorded in the rock art of the area, and as such are an interesting
        addition to the known corpus, as Mauritanian rock art has not been as thoroughly
        studied as that of other Saharan countries.'

        of the panel in Fig. 9, but in executed in a very different style. It appears
        to depict a group of armed horsemen, and warriors on foot, vanquishing others
        who are unmounted, who lie, presumably dead, to the left of the horsemen,
        surrounded by spears. This is an unusually dynamic depiction of conflict,
        and it is not known whether it depicts an imagined or real confrontation,
        or, if real, whether it is the work of an artist from the culture of the horsemen
        or those opposing them.

        It has been suggested that the painting of the horse scenes, in line with similar images from other rock art traditions, may be a cathartic spiritual exercise made, possibly by victims of raids, in response to violent intercultural contact. However as with the other images, without an accurate way of scientifically dating such paintings, it is hard to know exactly when they were painted and therefore difficult to propose of or by whom, much less ascribe motivations. Stone tools and the remains of iron smelting activity at Guilemsi suggest successive occupations, possibly over a long period.

        Stylistic links to other sites may be made, however: despite the fact that some of the iconography at Guilemsi appears quite unique, other elements, such as the bichrome cow in Fig. 6, and other square figures at Guilemsi of a man and giraffe, have similar looking counterparts in the Tichitt region, while the “bi-triangular” horses are found elsewhere in the Tagant and Adrar regions of Mauritania, and even as far away as Chad. Understanding of these links is still nascent, as is the interpretation of most Mauritanian rock art, but the variety present at Guilemsi is a valuable addition to the record, and more such sites may remain to be brought to the notice of scholars.

        In total Mauritania covers about 1,030,700 km², most of which forms part of the western portion of the Sahara desert. The southern part of Mauritania incorporates some of the more temperate Sahelian zone, forming part of the geographical and cultural border between Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa. The landscape of the country is generally characterised by its flatness, but the two major neighbouring plateaux in the East-Centre of the country – the Tagant in the South and the Adrar further North – are furnished with rock shelters, boulders and other surfaces upon which can be found abundant rock art, more often engraved than painted.

        The principal concentrations of rock art in Mauritania are located in these two areas, as well as in the North around Bir Moghreïn (in the Mauritanian extension of the Zemmur mountains), the Hank ridge near the borders of Algeria and Mali and the Tichitt-Walata area to the east of the Tagant plateau.

        __Adrar__

        There are about thirty known rock art sites in the Adrar region, although, as with most Mauritanian rock art, study has not been comprehensive and there may be many more as yet undocumented. Engraved rock art sites dominate along the northern edge of the massif, with some of the most significant to be found at the sites of El Beyyed and El Ghallaouiya. Rarer paintings of cattle are also to be found at El Ghallaouiya, as well as at the site of Amogjar.

        __Tagant__

        Less well studied than Adrar, the Tagant plateau contains several painting sites showing horses and riders such as those at the sites of Agneitir Dalma and Tinchmart. The archaeologically significant area of the Tichitt-Walata ridge, a chain of escarpments known for its Neolithic settlements, is largely located within the wider Tagant region to the east of the plateau, and also features many engravings and some paintings.

        Recording and research on Mauritanian rock art has been limited in comparison with other Saharan rock art traditions, and has mainly been undertaken by French scholars, as Mauritania was formerly part of French West Africa. The first major publications cataloguing rock art sites in the country were those of Théodore Monod (1937-8), based on recordings collected on expeditions made between 1934 and 1936 and covering the entire western Saharan region. Following this, the explorers Marion Senones and Odette du Puigaudeau published some paintings of the Tagant region in1939. A more comprehensive study of the paintings, engravings and inscriptions of West and North West Africa was made by Raymond Mauny (1954), and emphasised the importance of systematically recording and studying the images in their contexts. More recently (1993), Robert Vernet produced a synthesis of known Mauritanian rock art in his *Préhistoire de la Mauritanie*.

        Many individual Mauritanian rock art sites have also been recorded and published over the decades since the 1940s, particularly in the context of associated archaeological sites, such as those at Tegdaoust and in the Tichitt-Walata region.

        The range of subject matter in the rock art of Mauritania is similar to that of other Saharan countries, consisting primarily of images of domestic cattle, along with those of horses both mounted and unmounted, human figures and weaponry, wild fauna, hunting scenes, camels and Libyco-Berber/Tifinagh and Arabic script. Images of goats and sheep are extremely rare.

        Some general geographic tendencies in style and type can be made out, for example, deeply cut and polished naturalistic engravings of large wild animals are concentrated in the North of the country. There is an apparent North-South divide in engraving style, with images becoming more schematic further south. Rarer painting sites are clustered in certain areas such as north of Bir Moghreïn in the far north, and certain Adrar sites, with horse and rider paintings most common in the Tagant and Tichitt-Walata regions.

        Mauritanian rock art consists most commonly of similar-looking scenes of cattle, hunting tableaux, or camel depictions, but there are some exceptions of interest, for example: the monumental bull engraving from Akhrejit in the Dhar Tichitt, which is nearly 5 metres long; the unusually naturalistic paintings of cattle at Amogjar and Tenses in the Adrar; and the curiously shaped painted horses at Guilemsi in the Tagant-Titchitt region.

        In addition, although images of chariots apparently drawn by oxen are known elsewhere in the Sahara, chariots in Saharan rock art are normally associated with horses. In Mauritania, however, there are several images of ox chariots or carts – both painted and engraved – as well as depictions of cattle apparently bearing burdens/saddles, or mounted. Moreover, Mauritania has no known depictions of chariots where the draught animal is identifiably a horse, although there are many images of horses and riders. Sometimes chariots are depicted independent of any animals drawing them, and in all there are over 200 known images of chariots in the country.

      title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 6'
      body: 'As is the case with all Saharan rock art, sites found in Mauritania are
        very difficult to date, especially absolutely. Monod remarked: ‘it is impossible
        to propose even approximate dates: no landmark pinpoints the end of the Neolithic
        and the arrival of Libyan (Berber) horsemen’ (Monod, 1938, p.128). Relative
        chronologies of rock art styles are easier to identify than specific dates,
        as they may be based on visible elements such as superimpositions in paintings,
        and the darkness level of accrued patina in engravings. In Mauritania, researchers
        have generally paid particular attention to patina as well as themes and styles
        in order to try and place a timeframe on different rock art traditions. Even
        this is an inexact science – however, Monod did propose a three-phase chronology,
        with 1) ‘Ancient’ prehistoric rock art showing large wild fauna and cattle,
        2) ‘Middle’ pre-Islamic art showing horses, camels, riders, arms and armour,
        hunting scenes and Libyco-Berber script and 3) ‘Modern’ Islamic-era art with
        modern Tifinagh and Arabic inscriptions.'

      body: Mauny later proposed a more nuanced chronology, based also on style and
        technique, along the same lines as Monod’s. Mauny’s proposed divisions include
        a ‘naturalist’ period from 5,000–2,000 BC, a cattle pastoralist phase from
        2,500–1,000 BC, a horse period from 1,200 BC onwards, a ‘Libyco-Berber’ group
        from 200 BC–700 AD and a final ‘Arabo-Berber’ phase from 700 AD onwards (Mauny,
        1954). While the oldest rock art, such as the paintings at Amogjar, could
        be more than 5,000 years old, it appears that most Mauritanian rock art probably
        post-dates 2,000 BC, with some, particularly that involving camels, made within
        the last 2,000 years.

        time period over which rock art was produced in Mauritania coincided with
        dramatic changes in the climate and the desertification of the Sahara, which
        settled at present levels of aridity following increased dry periods: around
        1,500 BC in the North, and by the mid-1st Millenium AD in the South. There
        is some evidence for a combination of hunting and pastoral activity in the
        North-East prior to the desertification, with pastoralism becoming an important
        means of subsistence in the South after 2,000 BC.'

      body: The first solid archaeological evidence for horses this far west is from
        about 600 AD. However, horses and chariots could have been introduced over
        a thousand years before, possibly by early Berber peoples from the North,
        who are thought to have made increased incursions from the 4th Millennium
        onwards, and with whom much of the rock art is usually associated. Chariot
        images can be reasonably assumed to date from the time we know chariots were
        in use in the Sahara – i.e. not earlier than 1,200 BC.

      title: Interpretation
      title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 10'
      body: 'Generally, the study of Mauritanian rock art traditions has focused more
        on cataloguing the images and categorising them by style, technique and perceived
        age than investigating their potential cultural significance. The limitations
        in the ability to scientifically date these images, and the fact that they
        are not usually associated with other archaeological materials, hinders effective
        attempts at interpretation or ascribing authorship, beyond basic ‘Neolithic’
        ‘pastoralist’, or ‘early Berber’. Even this may not be clear-cut or mutually
        exclusive: for example, incoming Berber peoples in the Adrar Plateau after
        2,000 BC are thought to have been cattle pastoralists, as their non-Berber
        predecessors probably were. In addition, while the desertification process
        was definitive from this time on, fluctuations and regional microclimates
        made pastoralism viable relatively recently in some areas – in the Adrar there
        is still evidence of cattle rearing as late as 1,000 BC or after, and some
        areas of the Tagant region may have been able to support cattle as late as
        the 18th century. Thus subject matter alone is not necessarily indicative
        of date or authorship: depictions of cattle may be Berber or non-Berber, as
        old as the 4th millennium BC or as recent as the 1st, if not later.'

      body: It is possible to make some more specific inferences based on style. Some
        of the more naturalistic cattle paintings from the Adrar have been compared
        in style to the Bovidian style paintings of the Tassili n’Ajjer in Libya,
        and some of the more geometric designs to others in Senegal and Mali. Links
        have also been suggested between some cattle and symbolic images and modern
        Fulani and Tuareg traditions and iconography. In terms of significance, changes
        to rock art style over time, from naturalistic to schematic, have been remarked
        upon as perhaps somehow reflecting environmental changes from savannah to
        steppe and desert. It has also been debated whether some of the geometric
        symbols and images of riders on horseback were the result of conflict, perhaps
        made by the victims of Berber invasions as catharsis or to ward off evil.
