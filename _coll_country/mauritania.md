      body: A significant concentration of rock art in Mauritania is in the region
        of Guilemsi, an 11-km long ridge, about 70 m high at its highest point. Guilemsi
        is located in the desert, around 50 km north of the town of Tidjika, and about
        200 km west of the renowned Neolithic sites at Dhar Tichitt. Guilemsi’s south
        face contains many ravines with rock shelters, and the rock painting sites
        scattered around the area are to be found in open shelters and ridges or boulders
        on the cliff faces, as well as on the stone banks of a dry river. These sites
        are notable both for the solely painted nature of the rock art, and the variety
        of its subject matter.

      body: There are many stone constructions at Guilemsi that have been known to
        archaeologists for decades, although they have not received the academic attention
        that those further to the East in the Tichitt-Walata region had. The Dhars
        Tagant, Tichitt, Walata and Néma form an enormous crescent-shaped chain of
        sandstone escarpments, enclosing much of southern Mauritania and associated
        with a Neolithic ‘Tichitt Tradition’, which is based on the remains of over
        400 apparent settlements along the escarpment ridges. This culture is thought
        to have existed between about 2,000 BC and 200 BC, based on pastoralism and
        the cultivation of millet, before declining due to the increasing aridity
        of the environment and possible incursion by other cultural groups from the
        North.

        culture to the East is unclear. The ridge at Guilemsi contains many apparent
        funerary monuments consisting of rectangular stone platforms, as well as apparent
        dwelling structures. Some of the funerary monuments appear to be associated
        with rock shelters, but any connection of the stone structures to the rock
        art remains unknown.

        to Tichitt sites which more often feature engraved rock art. The only non-painted
        rock markings encountered at Guilemsi was several groups of cupules (round,
        man-made depressions in the rock) which were found in three rock shelters.
        Some of the paintings in the area are unusual in themselves- one of the most
        striking is a panel of handprints in red (Fig. 4.), as well as a couple of
        rare paintings appearing to be of big cats, and the heads and finely rendered
        horns of seven antelope, perhaps oryx (Fig. 5.).

        naturalistic cow with dramatically elongated legs, next to an artificially
        inflated-looking human figure (Fig. 8). Domestic cattle were present in the
        area from at least the second Millennium BC, so these paintings must post-date
        this, although whether they are associated with Tichitt-Tradition pastoralists
        or later groups is not known. The fact that even the more normally-proportioned
        cattle representations at Guilemsi are depicted in a variety of styles (Figs.

        contemporary) painting by peoples with different stylistic traditions.'

      body: 'Two of the most impressive panels of paintings from Guilemsi involve
        not cattle but another important domesticate: ridden horses. There is evidence
        of horses having reached the far West of North Africa by about 600 AD, but
        horses may have been used in the area much earlier, from the mid-1st Millennium
        BC, if not earlier. Although elsewhere in the Sahara the earliest horse images
        appear to show them used for draught purposes rather than riding, in Mauritania,
        almost all depictions of horses in rock art show them being ridden, often
        by apparently armed riders (eg. Fig. 11). At Guilemsi, there are several styles
        of paintings showing horses and riders: the ‘bi-triangular’ and stick-figure
        like styles (Figs. 10 & 11), which have been proposed to be associated with
        early Berber peoples, and another style, showing horses with elongated, stylised
        bodies and short necks (Fig. 9). These horse depictions appear to be of a
        form thus far unrecorded in the rock art of the area, and as such are an interesting
        addition to the known corpus, as Mauritanian rock art has not been as thoroughly
        studied as that of other Saharan countries.'

      body: Another very interesting tableau is that in Fig. 11, which is to the right
        of the panel in Fig. 9, but in executed in a very different style. It appears
        to depict a group of armed horsemen, and warriors on foot, vanquishing others
        who are unmounted, who lie, presumably dead, to the left of the horsemen,
        surrounded by spears. This is an unusually dynamic depiction of conflict,
        and it is not known whether it depicts an imagined or real confrontation,
        or, if real, whether it is the work of an artist from the culture of the horsemen
        or those opposing them.

        It has been suggested that the painting of the horse scenes, in line with similar images from other rock art traditions, may be a cathartic spiritual exercise made, possibly by victims of raids, in response to violent intercultural contact. However as with the other images, without an accurate way of scientifically dating such paintings, it is hard to know exactly when they were painted and therefore difficult to propose of or by whom, much less ascribe motivations. Stone tools and the remains of iron smelting activity at Guilemsi suggest successive occupations, possibly over a long period.

        Stylistic links to other sites may be made, however: despite the fact that some of the iconography at Guilemsi appears quite unique, other elements, such as the bichrome cow in Fig. 6, and other square figures at Guilemsi of a man and giraffe, have similar looking counterparts in the Tichitt region, while the “bi-triangular” horses are found elsewhere in the Tagant and Adrar regions of Mauritania, and even as far away as Chad. Understanding of these links is still nascent, as is the interpretation of most Mauritanian rock art, but the variety present at Guilemsi is a valuable addition to the record, and more such sites may remain to be brought to the notice of scholars.

      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 2'
      body: The first introduction of the domestic horse to Ancient Egypt- and thereby
        to Africa- is usually cited at around 1600 BC, linked with the arrival in
        Egypt of the Hyksos, a group from the Levant who ruled much of Northern Egypt
        during the Second Intermediate Period. By this point, horses had probably
        only been domesticated for about 2,000 years, but with the advent of the chariot
        after the 3rd millennium BC in Mesopotamia, the horse proved to be a valuable
        martial asset in the ancient world. One of the first clear records of the
        use of horses and chariots in battle in Africa is found in depictions from
        the mortuary complex of the Pharaoh Ahmose at Abydos from around 1525 BC,
        showing their use by Egyptians in defeating the Hyksos, and horses feature
        prominently in later Egyptian art.

      body: 'Some of the most renowned images of horses in Saharan rock art are also
        those of chariot teams: in particular, those of the so-called ‘flying gallop’
        style chariot pictures, from the Tassili n’Ajjer and Acacus mountains in modern
        Algeria and Libya. These distinctive images are characterised by depictions
        of one or more horses pulling a chariot with their legs outstretched in a
        stylised manner and are sometimes attributed to the Garamantes, a group who
        were a local power in the central Sahara from about 500 BC-700 AD. But the
        Ajjer Plateau is over a thousand miles from the Nile- how and when did the
        horse and chariot first make their way across the Western Desert to the rest
        of North Africa in the first place? Egyptian accounts indicate that by the
        11th century BC Libyans (people living on the north African coast around the
        border of modern Egypt and Libya) were using chariots in war. Classical sources
        later write about the chariots of the Garamantes and of chariot use by peoples
        of the far western Sahara continuing into the 1st century BC, by which time
        the chariot horse had largely been eclipsed in war by the cavalry mount.'

      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 4'
      body: As well as the unique iconography of rock art chariot depictions, there
        are also numerous paintings and engravings across northern Africa of people
        riding horses. Riding may have been practiced since the earliest times of
        horse domestication, though the earliest definitive depictions of horses being
        ridden come from the Middle East in the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia BC.
        Images of horses and riders in rock art occur in various areas of Morocco,
        Egypt and Sudan and are particularly notable in the Ennedi region of Chad
        and the Adrar and Tagant plateaus in Mauritania (interestingly, however, no
        definite images of horses are known in the Gilf Kebir/Jebel Uweinat area at
        the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya).

      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 5'
      body: Traditional chronologies for Saharan rock art areas tend to place depictions
        of ridden horses chronologically after those of horses and chariots, and in
        general use horse depictions to categorise regional stylistic periods of rock
        art according to broad date boundaries. As such, in most places, the ‘horse’
        rock art period is usually said to cover about a thousand years from the end
        of the 2nd millennium BC. It is then considered to be succeeded by a ‘camel’
        period, where the appearance of images of dromedaries – known only to have
        been introduced to the eastern Sahara from Arabia at the end of the 1st century
        BC – reflects the next momentous influx of a beast of burden to the area and
        thus a new dating parameter ([read more about depictions of camels in the
        Sahara](https://africanrockart.britishmuseum.org/thematic/camels-in-saharan-rock-art/)).
        However, such simplistic categorisation can be misleading. For one thing,
        although mounting horses certainly gained popularity over driving them, it
        is not always clear that depictions of ridden horses are not contemporary
        with those of chariots. Further, the horse remained an important martial tool
        after the use of war-chariots declined. Even after the introduction of the
        camel, there are several apparently contemporary depictions featuring both
        horse and camel riders.

      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 6'
      body: As the more manoeuvrable rider rose in popularity against the chariot
        as a weapon of war, historical reports from classical authors like Strabo
        tell us of the prowess of African horsemen such as the cavalry of the Numidians,
        a Berber group that allied with Carthage against the Romans in the 3rd century
        BC. Berber peoples would remain heavily associated with horse breeding and
        riding, and the later rock art of Mauritania has been attributed to Berber
        horsemen, or the sight of them. Although horses may already have reached the
        areas of modern Mauritania and Mali by this point, archaeological evidence
        does not confirm their presence in these south-westerly regions of the Sahara
        until much later, in the mid-1st millennium AD, and it has been suggested
        that some of the horse paintings in Mauritania may be as recent as 16th century.

        trans-Saharan trade routes and became items of great military value in West
        Africa following the introduction of equipment such as saddles with structured
        trees (frames). Indeed, discernible images of such accoutrements in Saharan
        rock art can help to date it following the likely introduction of the equipment

        to be no older than the 1st century AD; images including stirrups are even
        more recent.'

      body: 'Another intriguing possibility is that of gaining clues on the origins
        of modern horse breeds from rock art, in particular the ancient Barb breed
        native to the Maghreb, where it is still bred. Ancient Mesopotamian horses
        were generally depicted as heavily-built, and it has been suggested that the
        basic type for the delicate Arabian horse, with its dished (concave) facial
        profile and high-set tail, may have been developed in north-east Africa prior
        to its subsequent appearance and cultivation in Arabia, and that these features
        may be observed in Ancient Egyptian images from the New Kingdom. Likewise,
        there is the possibility that some of the more naturalistic paintings from
        the central Sahara show the similarly gracile features of the progenitors
        of the Barb, distinguishable from the Arab by its straight profile and low-set
        tail. Like the Arab, the Barb is a desert horse: hardy, sure-footed and able
        to withstand great heat; it is recognised as an ancient breed with an important
        genetic legacy, both in the ancestry of the Iberian horses later used throughout
        the Americas, and that of the modern racing thoroughbred.'

        alone, especially given the gulf of time that has elapsed and the relative
        paucity of ‘naturalistic’ rock art images. Indeed, there is huge diversity
        of horse depictions throughout northern Africa, with some forms highly schematic.
        This variation is not only in style – and, as previously noted, in time period
        and geography – but also in context, as of course images of one subject cannot
        be divorced from the other images around them, on whichever surface has been
        chosen, and are integral to these surroundings.

        apparent symbolism and implied value of the horse image in different cultural
        contexts. Where some Tassilian horses are delicately painted in lifelike detail,
        the stockier images of horses associated with the so-called ‘Libyan Warrior’
        style petroglyphs of the Aïr mountains and Adrar des Ifoghas in Niger and
        Mali appear more as symbolic accoutrements to the central human figures and
        tend not to be shown as ridden. By contrast, there are paintings in the Ennedi
        plateau of Chad where galloping horse figures have clearly been painted over
        existing walking human figures to make them appear as if riding.

        In each of these cases, the original symbolic intent of the artists have been lost to time, but with these horse depictions, as with so much African rock art imagery, there is great scope for further future analysis. Particularly intriguing, for example, are the striking stylistic similarities in horse depictions across great distances, such the horse depictions with bi-triangular bodies (e.g. figs 5 &13), or with fishbone-style tails which may be found almost two thousand miles apart in Chad and Mauritania.

        Whatever the myriad circumstances and significances of the images, it is clear that following its introduction to the continent, the hardy and surefooted desert horse’s usefulness for draught, transport and fighting purposes transformed the societies which used it and gave it a powerful symbolic value.

      body: Yet, surprising as it seems, the camel is a relative newcomer to the Sahara
        – at least when compared to other domestic animals such as cattle, sheep,
        horses and donkeys. Although the process is not yet fully known, camels were
        domesticated in the Arabian Peninsula around the third millennium BC, and
        spread from there to the Middle East, North Africa and Somalia from the 1st
        century AD onwards. The steps of this process from Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean
        have been documented through many different historical sources, from Roman
        texts to sculptures or coins, but it is especially relevant in Saharan rock
        art, where camels became so abundant that they have given their name to a
        whole period. The depictions of camels provide an incredible amount of information
        about the life, culture and economy of the Berber and other nomadic communities
        from the beginnings of the Christian era to the Muslim conquest in the late
        years of the 7th century.

      body: 'What is it that makes camels so suited to deserts? It is not only their
        ability to transform the fat stored in their hump into water and energy, or
        their capacity to eat thorny bushes, acacia leaves and even fish and bones.
        Camels are also able to avoid perspiration by manipulating their core temperature,
        enduring fluctuations of up to six degrees that could be fatal for other mammals.
        They rehydrate very quickly, and some of their physical features (nostrils,
        eyebrows) have adapted to increase water conservation and protect the animals
        from dust and sand. All these capacities make camels uniquely suited to hot
        climates: in temperatures of 30-40 °C, they can spend up to 15 days without
        water. In addition, they are large animals, able to carry loads of up to 300kg,
        over long journeys across harsh environments. The pads on their feet have
        evolved so as to prevent them from sinking into the sand. It is not surprising
        that dromedaries are considered the ‘ships of the desert’, transporting people,
        commodities and goods through the vast territories of the Sahara.'

      body: As mentioned previously, camels came from the Arabian Peninsula through
        Egypt, where bone remains have been dated to the early 1st millennium BC.
        However, it took hundreds of years to move into the rest of North Africa due
        to the River Nile, which represented a major geographical and climatic barrier
        for these animals. The expansion began around the beginning of the Christian
        era, and probably took place both along the Mediterranean Sea and through
        the south of the Sahara. At this stage, it appears to have been very rapid,
        and during the following centuries camels became a key element in the North
        African societies. They were used mainly for riding, but also for transporting
        heavy goods and even for ploughing. Their milk, hair and meat were also used,
        improving the range of resources available to their herders. However, it seems
        that the large caravans that crossed the desert searching for gold, ivory
        or slaves came later, when the Muslim conquest of North Africa favoured the
        establishment of vast trade networks with the Sahel, the semi-arid region
        that lies south of the Sahara.

      body: Rock art can be extremely helpful in learning about the different ways
        in which camels were used in the first millennium AD. Images of camels are
        found in both engravings and paintings in red, white or – on rare occasions
        – black; sometimes the colours are combined to achieve a more impressive effect.
        They usually appear in groups, alongside humans, cattle and, occasionally,
        dogs and horses. Sometimes, even palm trees and houses are included to represent
        the oases where the animals were watered. Several of the scenes show female
        camels herded or taking care of their calves, showing the importance of camel-herding
        and breeding for the Libyan-Berber communities.

      body: |-
        That camels were used to transport goods is obvious, and depictions of long lines of animals are common, sometimes with saddles on which to place the packs and ropes to tie the animals together. However, if rock art depictions are some indication of camel use, it seems that until the Muslim conquest the main function of one-humped camels was as mounts, often linked to war. The Sahara desert contains dozens of astonishingly detailed images of warriors riding camels, armed with spears, long swords and shields, sometimes accompanied by infantry soldiers and horsemen. Although camels are not as good as horses for use as war mounts (they are too tall and make insecure platforms for shooting arrows), they were undoubtedly very useful in raids – the most common type of war activity in the desert – as well as being a symbol of prestige, wealth and authority among the desert warriors, much as they still are today.

        Moreover, the extraordinary detail of some of the rock art paintings has provided inestimable help in understanding how (and why) camels were ridden in the 1st millennium AD. Unlike horses, donkeys or mules, one-humped camels present a major problem for riders: where to put the saddle. Although it might be assumed that the saddle should be placed over the hump, they can, in fact, also be positioned behind or in front of the hump, depending on the activity. It seems that the first saddles were placed behind the hump, but that position was unsuitable for fighting, quite uncomfortable, and unstable. Subsequently, a new saddle was invented in North Arabia around the 5th century BC: a framework of wood that rested over the hump and provided a stable platform on which to ride and fight more effectively. The North Arabian saddle led to a revolution in the domestication of one-humped camels, allowed a faster expansion of the use of these animals, and it is probably still the most used type of saddle today.

      body: 'Although North Arabian saddles are found throughout North Africa and
        are often depicted in rock art paintings, at some point a new kind of saddle
        was designed in North Africa: one placed in front of the hump, with the weight
        over the shoulders of the camel. This type of shoulder saddle allows the rider
        to control the camel with the feet and legs, thus improving the ride. Moreover,
        the rider is seated in a lower position and thus needs shorter spears and
        swords that can be brandished more easily, making warriors more efficient.
        This new kind of saddle, which is still used throughout North Africa today,
        appears only in the western half of the Sahara and is well represented in
        the rock art of Algeria, Niger and Mauritania. And it is not only saddles
        that are recognizable in Saharan rock art: harnesses, reins, whips or blankets
        are identifiable in the paintings and show astonishing similarities to those
        still used today by desert peoples.'

      body: Since their introduction to the Sahara during the first centuries of the
        Christian era, camels have become indispensable for desert communities, providing
        a method of transport for people and commodities, but also for their milk,
        meat and hair for weaving. They allowed the improvement of wide cultural and
        economic networks, transforming the Sahara into a key node linking the Mediterranean
        Sea with Sub-Saharan Africa. A symbol of wealth and prestige, the Libyan-Berber
        peoples recognized camels’ importance and expressed it through paintings and
        engravings across the desert, leaving a wonderful document of their societies.
        The painted images of camel-riders crossing the desert not only have an evocative
        presence, they are also perfect snapshots of a history that started two thousand
        years ago and seems as eternal as the Sahara.

        Although the styles and subjects of north African rock art vary, there are commonalities: images are most often figurative and frequently depict animals, both wild and domestic. There are also many images of human figures, sometimes with accessories such as recognisable weaponry or clothing. These may be painted or engraved, with frequent occurrences of both, at times in the same context. Engravings are generally more common, although this may simply be a preservation bias due to their greater durability.

        The physical context of rock art sites varies depending on geographical and topographical factors – for example, Moroccan rock engravings are often found on open rocky outcrops, while Tunisia’s Djebibina rock art sites have all been found in rock shelters. Rock art in the vast and harsh environments of the Sahara is often inaccessible and hard to find, and there is probably a great deal of rock art that is yet to be seen by archaeologists; what is known has mostly been documented within the last century.

      body: Although the existence of rock art throughout the Sahara was known to
        local communities, it was not until the nineteenth century that it became
        known to Europeans, thanks to explorers such as Heinrich Barth, who crossed
        the Messak Plateau in Libya in 1850, first noting the existence of engravings.
        Further explorations in the early twentieth century by celebrated travellers,
        ethnographers and archaeologists such as Hassanein Bey, Abbé Breuil, László
        Almásy, Henri Lhote and Leo Frobenius brought the rock art of Sahara, and
        northern Africa in general, to the awareness of a European public.

      body: 'The investigations of these researchers and those who have followed them
        have sought to date and attribute these artworks, with varying measures of
        success. Rock art may be associated with certain cultures through known parallels
        with the imagery in other artefacts, such as Naqada Period designs in Egyptian
        rock art that mirror those on dateable pottery. Authorship may be also guessed
        at through corroborating evidence: for example, due to knowledge of their
        chariot use, and the location of rock art depicting chariots in the central
        Sahara, it has been suggested that it was produced by – or at the same time
        as – the height of the Garamantes culture, a historical ethnic group who formed
        a local power around what is now southern Libya from 500 BC–700 AD. However,
        opportunities to anchor rock art imagery in this way to known ancient cultures
        are few and far between, and rock art is generally ascribed to anonymous hunter-gatherers,
        nomadic peoples, or pastoralists, with occasional imagery-based comparisons
        made with contemporary groups, such as the Fulani peoples.'

        Occasionally, association with writing in the form of, for example, Libyan-Berber or Arabic graffiti can give a known dating margin, but in general, lack of contemporary writing and written sources (Herodotus wrote about the Garamantes) leaves much open to conjecture.

        Other forms of (rare) circumstantial evidence, such as rock art covered by a dateable stratigraphic layer, and (more common) stylistic image-based dating have been used instead to form a chronology of Saharan rock art periods that is widely agreed upon, although dates are contested. The first stage, known as the Early Hunter, Wild Fauna or Bubalus Period, is posited at about 12,000–6,000 years ago, and is typified by naturalistic engravings of wild animals, in particular an extinct form of buffalo identifiable by its long horns.

        Following this is the most widespread style, the Pastoral Period (around 7,500
        to 4,000 years ago), which is characterised by numerous paintings and engravings
        of cows, as well as occasional hunting scenes. The Horse Period (around 3,000
        to 2,000 years ago) features recognisable horses and chariots and the final
        Camel Period (around 2,000 years ago to present) features domestic dromedary
        camels, which we know to have been widely used across the Sahara from that
        time.

        The engravings of weaponry motifs from Morocco and the painted ‘swimming’
        figures of the Gilf Kebir Plateau in Egypt and Sudan are not only completely
        different, but unique to their areas. Being thousands of kilometres apart
        and so different in style and composition, they serve to illustrate the limitations
        inherent in examining northern African rock art as a unit. The contemporary
        political and environmental challenges to accessing rock art sites in countries
        across the Sahara serves as another limiting factor in their study, but as
        dating techniques improve and further discoveries are made, this is a field
        with the potential to help illuminate much of the prehistory of northern Africa.\n\n"

        In total Mauritania covers about 1,030,700 km², most of which forms part of the western portion of the Sahara desert. The southern part of Mauritania incorporates some of the more temperate Sahelian zone, forming part of the geographical and cultural border between Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa. The landscape of the country is generally characterised by its flatness, but the two major neighbouring plateaux in the East-Centre of the country – the Tagant in the South and the Adrar further North – are furnished with rock shelters, boulders and other surfaces upon which can be found abundant rock art, more often engraved than painted.

        The principal concentrations of rock art in Mauritania are located in these two areas, as well as in the North around Bir Moghreïn (in the Mauritanian extension of the Zemmur mountains), the Hank ridge near the borders of Algeria and Mali and the Tichitt-Walata area to the east of the Tagant plateau.

        __Adrar__

        There are about thirty known rock art sites in the Adrar region, although, as with most Mauritanian rock art, study has not been comprehensive and there may be many more as yet undocumented. Engraved rock art sites dominate along the northern edge of the massif, with some of the most significant to be found at the sites of El Beyyed and El Ghallaouiya. Rarer paintings of cattle are also to be found at El Ghallaouiya, as well as at the site of Amogjar.

        __Tagant__

        Less well studied than Adrar, the Tagant plateau contains several painting sites showing horses and riders such as those at the sites of Agneitir Dalma and Tinchmart. The archaeologically significant area of the Tichitt-Walata ridge, a chain of escarpments known for its Neolithic settlements, is largely located within the wider Tagant region to the east of the plateau, and also features many engravings and some paintings.

        Recording and research on Mauritanian rock art has been limited in comparison with other Saharan rock art traditions, and has mainly been undertaken by French scholars, as Mauritania was formerly part of French West Africa. The first major publications cataloguing rock art sites in the country were those of Théodore Monod (1937-8), based on recordings collected on expeditions made between 1934 and 1936 and covering the entire western Saharan region. Following this, the explorers Marion Senones and Odette du Puigaudeau published some paintings of the Tagant region in1939. A more comprehensive study of the paintings, engravings and inscriptions of West and North West Africa was made by Raymond Mauny (1954), and emphasised the importance of systematically recording and studying the images in their contexts. More recently (1993), Robert Vernet produced a synthesis of known Mauritanian rock art in his *Préhistoire de la Mauritanie*.

        Many individual Mauritanian rock art sites have also been recorded and published over the decades since the 1940s, particularly in the context of associated archaeological sites, such as those at Tegdaoust and in the Tichitt-Walata region.

        The range of subject matter in the rock art of Mauritania is similar to that of other Saharan countries, consisting primarily of images of domestic cattle, along with those of horses both mounted and unmounted, human figures and weaponry, wild fauna, hunting scenes, camels and Libyco-Berber/Tifinagh and Arabic script. Images of goats and sheep are extremely rare.

        Some general geographic tendencies in style and type can be made out, for example, deeply cut and polished naturalistic engravings of large wild animals are concentrated in the North of the country. There is an apparent North-South divide in engraving style, with images becoming more schematic further south. Rarer painting sites are clustered in certain areas such as north of Bir Moghreïn in the far north, and certain Adrar sites, with horse and rider paintings most common in the Tagant and Tichitt-Walata regions.

        Mauritanian rock art consists most commonly of similar-looking scenes of cattle, hunting tableaux, or camel depictions, but there are some exceptions of interest, for example: the monumental bull engraving from Akhrejit in the Dhar Tichitt, which is nearly 5 metres long; the unusually naturalistic paintings of cattle at Amogjar and Tenses in the Adrar; and the curiously shaped painted horses at Guilemsi in the Tagant-Titchitt region.

        In addition, although images of chariots apparently drawn by oxen are known elsewhere in the Sahara, chariots in Saharan rock art are normally associated with horses. In Mauritania, however, there are several images of ox chariots or carts – both painted and engraved – as well as depictions of cattle apparently bearing burdens/saddles, or mounted. Moreover, Mauritania has no known depictions of chariots where the draught animal is identifiably a horse, although there are many images of horses and riders. Sometimes chariots are depicted independent of any animals drawing them, and in all there are over 200 known images of chariots in the country.

        very difficult to date, especially absolutely. Monod remarked: ‘it is impossible
        to propose even approximate dates: no landmark pinpoints the end of the Neolithic
        and the arrival of Libyan (Berber) horsemen’ (Monod, 1938, p.128). Relative
        chronologies of rock art styles are easier to identify than specific dates,
        as they may be based on visible elements such as superimpositions in paintings,
        and the darkness level of accrued patina in engravings. In Mauritania, researchers
        have generally paid particular attention to patina as well as themes and styles
        in order to try and place a timeframe on different rock art traditions. Even
        this is an inexact science – however, Monod did propose a three-phase chronology,
        with 1) ‘Ancient’ prehistoric rock art showing large wild fauna and cattle,
        2) ‘Middle’ pre-Islamic art showing horses, camels, riders, arms and armour,
        hunting scenes and Libyco-Berber script and 3) ‘Modern’ Islamic-era art with
        modern Tifinagh and Arabic inscriptions.'

        a ‘naturalist’ period from 5,000–2,000 BC, a cattle pastoralist phase from
        2,500–1,000 BC, a horse period from 1,200 BC onwards, a ‘Libyco-Berber’ group
        from 200 BC–700 AD and a final ‘Arabo-Berber’ phase from 700 AD onwards (Mauny,
        1954). While the oldest rock art, such as the paintings at Amogjar, could
        be more than 5,000 years old, it appears that most Mauritanian rock art probably
        post-dates 2,000 BC, with some, particularly that involving camels, made within
        the last 2,000 years.

        a thousand years before, possibly by early Berber peoples from the North,
        who are thought to have made increased incursions from the 4th Millennium
        onwards, and with whom much of the rock art is usually associated. Chariot
        images can be reasonably assumed to date from the time we know chariots were
        in use in the Sahara – i.e. not earlier than 1,200 BC.

        are not usually associated with other archaeological materials, hinders effective
        attempts at interpretation or ascribing authorship, beyond basic ‘Neolithic’
        ‘pastoralist’, or ‘early Berber’. Even this may not be clear-cut or mutually
        exclusive: for example, incoming Berber peoples in the Adrar Plateau after
        2,000 BC are thought to have been cattle pastoralists, as their non-Berber
        predecessors probably were. In addition, while the desertification process
        was definitive from this time on, fluctuations and regional microclimates
        made pastoralism viable relatively recently in some areas – in the Adrar there
        is still evidence of cattle rearing as late as 1,000 BC or after, and some
        areas of the Tagant region may have been able to support cattle as late as
        the 18th century. Thus subject matter alone is not necessarily indicative
        of date or authorship: depictions of cattle may be Berber or non-Berber, as
        old as the 4th millennium BC or as recent as the 1st, if not later.'

        and some of the more geometric designs to others in Senegal and Mali. Links
        have also been suggested between some cattle and symbolic images and modern
        Fulani and Tuareg traditions and iconography. In terms of significance, changes
        to rock art style over time, from naturalistic to schematic, have been remarked
        upon as perhaps somehow reflecting environmental changes from savannah to
        steppe and desert. It has also been debated whether some of the geometric

        made by the victims of Berber invasions as catharsis or to ward off evil.
