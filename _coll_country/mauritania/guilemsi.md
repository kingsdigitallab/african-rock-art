    body: A significant concentration of rock art in Mauritania is in the region of
      Guilemsi, an 11-km long ridge, about 70 m high at its highest point. Guilemsi
      is located in the desert, around 50 km north of the town of Tidjika, and about
      200 km west of the renowned Neolithic sites at Dhar Tichitt. Guilemsi’s south
      face contains many ravines with rock shelters, and the rock painting sites scattered
      around the area are to be found in open shelters and ridges or boulders on the
      cliff faces, as well as on the stone banks of a dry river. These sites are notable
      both for the solely painted nature of the rock art, and the variety of its subject
      matter.

    body: There are many stone constructions at Guilemsi that have been known to archaeologists
      for decades, although they have not received the academic attention that those
      further to the East in the Tichitt-Walata region had. The Dhars Tagant, Tichitt,
      Walata and Néma form an enormous crescent-shaped chain of sandstone escarpments,
      enclosing much of southern Mauritania and associated with a Neolithic ‘Tichitt
      Tradition’, which is based on the remains of over 400 apparent settlements along
      the escarpment ridges. This culture is thought to have existed between about
      2,000 BC and 200 BC, based on pastoralism and the cultivation of millet, before
      declining due to the increasing aridity of the environment and possible incursion
      by other cultural groups from the North.

    body: The Tichitt Tradition is characterised by dry stonewall remains, and these
      are found at Guilemsi, although the extent of the connection with the Tichitt
      culture to the East is unclear. The ridge at Guilemsi contains many apparent
      funerary monuments consisting of rectangular stone platforms, as well as apparent
      dwelling structures. Some of the funerary monuments appear to be associated
      with rock shelters, but any connection of the stone structures to the rock art
      remains unknown.

    body: The rock art at Guilemsi appears to be all painted, which marks a contrast
      to Tichitt sites which more often feature engraved rock art. The only non-painted
      rock markings encountered at Guilemsi was several groups of cupules (round,
      man-made depressions in the rock) which were found in three rock shelters. Some
      of the paintings in the area are unusual in themselves- one of the most striking
      is a panel of handprints in red (Fig. 4.), as well as a couple of rare paintings
      appearing to be of big cats, and the heads and finely rendered horns of seven
      antelope, perhaps oryx (Fig. 5.).

    body: 'Cattle, perhaps the most common animal subject in Mauritanian rock art,
      are also depicted here, notably in another singular scene: one of an otherwise
      naturalistic cow with dramatically elongated legs, next to an artificially inflated-looking
      human figure (Fig. 8). Domestic cattle were present in the area from at least
      the second Millennium BC, so these paintings must post-date this, although whether
      they are associated with Tichitt-Tradition pastoralists or later groups is not
      known. The fact that even the more normally-proportioned cattle representations
      at Guilemsi are depicted in a variety of styles (Figs. 6 & 7) while in the same
      vicinity may suggest successive (or perhaps even contemporary) painting by peoples
      with different stylistic traditions.'

    body: 'Two of the most impressive panels of paintings from Guilemsi involve not
      cattle but another important domesticate: ridden horses. There is evidence of
      horses having reached the far West of North Africa by about 600 AD, but horses
      may have been used in the area much earlier, from the mid-1st Millennium BC,
      if not earlier. Although elsewhere in the Sahara the earliest horse images appear
      to show them used for draught purposes rather than riding, in Mauritania, almost
      all depictions of horses in rock art show them being ridden, often by apparently
      armed riders (eg. Fig. 11). At Guilemsi, there are several styles of paintings
      showing horses and riders: the ‘bi-triangular’ and stick-figure like styles
      (Figs. 10 & 11), which have been proposed to be associated with early Berber
      peoples, and another style, showing horses with elongated, stylised bodies and
      short necks (Fig. 9). These horse depictions appear to be of a form thus far
      unrecorded in the rock art of the area, and as such are an interesting addition
      to the known corpus, as Mauritanian rock art has not been as thoroughly studied
      as that of other Saharan countries.'

    body: Another very interesting tableau is that in Fig. 11, which is to the right
      of the panel in Fig. 9, but in executed in a very different style. It appears
      to depict a group of armed horsemen, and warriors on foot, vanquishing others
      who are unmounted, who lie, presumably dead, to the left of the horsemen, surrounded
      by spears. This is an unusually dynamic depiction of conflict, and it is not
      known whether it depicts an imagined or real confrontation, or, if real, whether
      it is the work of an artist from the culture of the horsemen or those opposing
      them.

      It has been suggested that the painting of the horse scenes, in line with similar images from other rock art traditions, may be a cathartic spiritual exercise made, possibly by victims of raids, in response to violent intercultural contact. However as with the other images, without an accurate way of scientifically dating such paintings, it is hard to know exactly when they were painted and therefore difficult to propose of or by whom, much less ascribe motivations. Stone tools and the remains of iron smelting activity at Guilemsi suggest successive occupations, possibly over a long period.

      Stylistic links to other sites may be made, however: despite the fact that some of the iconography at Guilemsi appears quite unique, other elements, such as the bichrome cow in Fig. 6, and other square figures at Guilemsi of a man and giraffe, have similar looking counterparts in the Tichitt region, while the “bi-triangular” horses are found elsewhere in the Tagant and Adrar regions of Mauritania, and even as far away as Chad. Understanding of these links is still nascent, as is the interpretation of most Mauritanian rock art, but the variety present at Guilemsi is a valuable addition to the record, and more such sites may remain to be brought to the notice of scholars.
