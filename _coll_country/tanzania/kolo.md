    body: The Kondoa rock art sites are located on the eastern slopes of the Maasai
      escarpment, which borders the western side of the Great Rift Valley in central
      Tanzania, covering an area of over 2,336 km². Stretching for around 18 km along
      the escarpment, the exact number of rock art sites in the Kondoa area is unknown
      but is estimated to be up to 450, the oldest of which are thought be more than
      2,000 years old. The extensive and spectacular collection of rock paintings
      are attributable to both hunter-gatherer and pastoralist communities and the
      images are testament to the changing socio-economic environment in the region.
      The hunter-gatherer rock paintings of Kondoa are dominated by human figures
      and animals. While a dark reddish brown predominates, other colours include
      yellow, orange, red and white.  Some of the shelters are still considered to
      have cultural associations with the people who live nearby, reflecting their
      beliefs, rituals and cosmological traditions. In 2006, Kondoa was nominated
      and listed as one of UNESCO’s World Heritage rock art sites in Africa.

    body: "The sites at Kolo are the most famous of the Kondoa paintings. Kolo comprises
      three rock art sites, known as Kolo 1, 2 and 3. The main site, Kolo 1 (known
      locally as Mongomi wa Kolo) is a large, imposing rock shelter that is only accessible
      by following a winding path at the end of a dirt road. This site contains many
      fine-line red paintings, some of which are very faded; but the site is still
      used by the local community for secret rituals. Kolo 2 is located south of the
      main site and includes human and animal figures, while Kolo 3 is north of Kolo1
      and is characterised by human, animal and geometric figures. The renowned palaeontologist
      Mary Leakey surveyed and documented many of the paintings at Kolo in the 1950s.
      \ The examples we see here are thought to have been made by early hunter-gatherer
      groups, ancestors of the modern Sandawe, one of the first cultural groups to
      inhabit Kondoa.   \n\n"

    body: "__Art__\n\nAmong the animals depicted are elephants, giraffes, antelopes,
      eland, rhinoceros and wildebeest; while human figures are represented as slender
      and elongated, often with elaborate hairstyles or headdresses, holding bows
      and arrows. Groups of figures are also shown bent at the waist, with some appearing
      to take on animal characteristics. These paintings have been associated with
      Sandawe cultural beliefs. \n\nThe Sandawe communicate with the spirits by taking
      on the power of an animal and some features at Mongomi wa Kolo can be understood
      by reference to the Sandawe traditional practice known as simbó (Ten Raa 1971,
      1974). Developing Ten Raa’s observations, Lewis-Williams (1986) proposed that
      simbó is the ritual of being a lion, and that simbó dancers are believed to
      turn into lions. Lim (1992, 1996) adopted a site-specific approach to the rock
      art and has suggested that the importance of place is as important as the images
      themselves. According to Lim the potency of a place is produced through ritual
      activities, so that meaning resides in the process of painting in a particular
      location, rather than in the painted image itself.  \n"

      Ritual Practices

      Ritual sites are generally located near fig and baobab trees, and springs. However, about 3 m south of the main Kolo shelter, a cavity underneath a huge boulder is used, even today, by local diviners, healers and rainmakers to invoke visions and communicate with the spirits. Oral traditions indicate that Mongomi wa Kolo is considered more powerful than other ritual places in Kondoa, and its unusual location may contribute to its efficacy.  The other two shelters of Kolo 2 and 3 are also used for ritual ceremonies.

      __Conservation__

      When Mary Leakey was surveying the Kondoa rock paintings in 1983 she predicted that if serious preservation and conservation measures were not put in place the paintings would be destroyed by 2020. Although inscribed onto the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2006, it has been noted paintings are being destroyed by the dust from the ground and in some cases rainwater is causing the paintings to deteriorate.

      Moreover, the documentation of paintings at Kondoa is incomplete, and some areas have not been surveyed at all. Bwasiri (2008) advocates an urgent need to collate all existing information in this region and implement a sites and monuments record that also takes into account living heritage values.
