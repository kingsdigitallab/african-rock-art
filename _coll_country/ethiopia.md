      body: The site of Shepe (also known as Chabbé, Šappe or Mancheti) is located
        in the Sidamo Zone of Oromia, about 250 km to the south of Addis Ababa. The
        region is a fertile, forest-mountainous area traditionally dedicated to the
        cultivation of coffee. The site is in a narrow gorge carved by the Shepe River
        at 1300 m above sea level, full of vegetation and therefore difficult to detect.
        Along this gorge there are several notable  engravings depicted in four panels,
        forming one of the most impressive – if secluded —  rock art sites in the
        Horn of Africa. The site was discovered in 1965 by Fitaorari Selechi Defabatchaw,
        governor of the Dilla district where the site is located, and was published
        by Francis Anfray two years later. Since that, the importance of Shepe has
        been widely recognized and some other sites with similar engravings have been
        documented in the surrounding area. This group (known generically as the Shepe-Galma
        group) constitutes one of the main areas of Ethiopian rock art, the other
        being the Laga Oda-Sourré group in the Harar region.

      body: 'The rock art of Shepe consists almost exclusively of engravings of humpless
        cows which follow very strict conventions: profile bodies, small heads with
        long horns seen from above, U-like bellies and udders very clearly depicted.
        Some of the cows have an unidentified, triangular object hanging from their
        left horn. In total, around 50 relatively large cows (40 to 70 cm in length)
        are depicted throughout the gorge walls, distributed in rows and groups to
        represent herds. The most original feature of these engravings is, however,
        the technique used to depict them: rather than carving the outline of the
        cows, the area around them has been lowered to provide a bas-relief effect
        which has no known parallels in the region. The surface of the cows has been
        polished to obtain a smooth appearance.'

      body: The chronology of the Shepe cows is difficult to determine, but stylistically
        they have been related to the Laga Oda paintings in the area of Harar and
        to other sites in Eritrea and Djibouti. According to most researchers, the
        Shepe figures have been ascribed to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabian style,
        with a generic chronology from the 3rd to the 1st millennia BC. Shepe engravings
        can be considered relatively naturalistic, and therefore should be among the
        oldest depictions of this style. Other interpretations, however, consider
        Shepe and the nearby sites a completely differentiated school whose chronology
        is still unclear but could be more recent.

      body: Regarding their meaning, only conjecture can be made at present, but it
        seems quite likely that they were made by pastoral communities to whom cattle
        were fundamental. The careful depiction of the udders, the repetition of this
        single motif and the effort paid to achieve the bas-relief effect imply a
        paramount importance of cattle in the economy and society of the group that
        engraved them. The fact that some of the cows have what seem to be adornments
        hanging from the horns (a feature documented in other rock art regions as
        the Libyan Messak) also points in that direction. Contemporary groups, such
        as the Nuer in nearby Sudan have similar traditions of horn adornments, and
        throughout the Omo river region different techniques of embellishment (ear
        cutting, horn shaping, modifications of the hump) have been documented, and
        in all of them cattle are a key cultural mark as well as an economic resource.  Of
        course, direct links cannot be established between these contemporary examples
        and the communities that made the engravings of Shepe, but the cattle depictions
        in the ravine are nevertheless a document of the importance and consideration
        given to cattle, an animal which was undoubtedly part of these groups’ identity.

      title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 1'
      body: Ethiopia is the biggest country of the Horn of Africa, a very diverse
        country which has traditionally been a melting pot of cultures, religions
        and ethnicities, acting as a crossroads between the Nile valley region, the
        Red Sea and East Africa. Most rock art is located in the southern part of
        the country, although smaller concentrations have been documented near the
        borders with Eritrea, Sudan and Kenya. Ethiopian rock art shows strong similarities
        with other countries in the Horn of Africa as well as Sudan and mostly consists
        of cow depictions dated from the 3rd millennium onwards, although other animals,
        anthropomorphic figures and geometric symbols are also fairly common.

      title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 2'
      body: The geography of Ethiopia is varied and ranges from high plateaus to savannahs
        and deserts.   The eastern part mostly consists of a range of plateaus and
        high mountains, which in some cases reach more than 4000m above sea level.
        To the north of these mountains is Lake Tana, the biggest lake in Ethiopia
        and the source of the Blue Nile, one of the two tributaries of the Nile. The
        mountains are divided in two by the Great Rift Valley, which runs north-east
        to south-west, - and is one of the most important areas for the study of human
        evolution. The highlands are surrounded by tropical savannah and grassland
        regions to the west and south-west, while to the east lays the Danakil desert,
        one of the most inhospitable regions on earth. The south-eastern corner of
        Ethiopia, which borders Somalia, is a semi-desert plateau ranging from 300-1500
        m above sea level.

      body: 'Ethiopian rock art is located around two main areas: around the city
        of Harar to the east and the Sidamo region to the south-west. The first group
        comprises mainly painted depictions, while the second one is characterized
        by a bas-relief technique specific only to this area. However, rock art has
        also been discovered in other areas, such as the border with Eritrea, the
        area near Kenya and the Benishangul-Gumuz region, a lowland area along the
        border with Sudan. As research increases, it is likely that more rock art
        sites will be discovered throughout the country. In addition to these engravings
        and paintings, Ethiopia is also known for its decorated stelae, tall stone
        obelisks that are usually engraved with culturally and religiously important
        symbols. One of these places is Tiya, a burial place declared a World Heritage
        Site which has 32 richly decorated stelae. Although not strictly rock art
        in the traditional sense, they nevertheless represent one of the most interesting
        group of archaeological remains in the south of Ethiopia and demonstrate similar
        techniques to some of the engraved depictions.'

      title: Research history
      title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 4'
      body: Ethiopian rock art has played a key role in the Horn of Africa research,
        and the studies undertaken in this country have structured the chronologies,
        styles and interpretations of the whole region. Research started as early
        as the mid-1930s when the Abbé Henri Breuil proposed a classification of Ethiopian
        rock art through the study of the Porc-Epic and Genda-Biftou sites. This proposal
        stated a progressive evolution in eight steps from naturalism to schematism,
        and set the interpretative framework for succeeding decades. Breuil’s ideas
        were generally followed by John Desmond Clark in his synthesis of the rock
        art in the Horn of Africa in 1954, and they also appear in the work of Paolo
        Graziosi (1964). During the 1960s, research was carried out by Francis Anfray
        in the Sidamo area and by Gerard Bailloud near Harar, where a report made
        for the Ethiopian government informed about the existence of around ten rock
        art sites in the same area.

      body: Rock art research in Ethiopia has traditionally included the term Ethiopian-Arabian
        style, coined in 1971 by Červiček to show the similarities between the depictions
        found in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The existence of this
        style is currently the paradigm used in most rock art interpretations of the
        region, although some concerns have been raised due to its too generic characteristics,
        which can be found in many other parts of Africa.  The 1990s and 2000s have
        seen a remarkable increase of rock art research in the country, with the renewal
        of studies in the main areas and the beginning of research in the regions
        of Tigray and Benishangul-Gumuz.

      body: Cattle and cattle-related depictions are the main subject of Ethiopian
        rock art, regardless of their relative chronology. The oldest depictions (based
        on Červiček’s works) are of humpless cows, while in the late stages of rock
        art humped cows and camels appear. Goats, sheep and dogs are very occasionally
        depicted, and unlike the Saharan rock art, wild animals such as giraffes and
        antelopes are scarce. Figures of cattle appear alone or in herds, and the
        depictions of cows with calves are a fairly common motif not only in Ethiopia
        but in the whole Horn of Africa.

      body: The other main group of depictions is of anthropomorphs, which are usually
        schematic and often distributed in rows. In some cases, the tendency to schematism
        is so pronounced that human figures are reduced to an H-like shape. Sometimes,
        human figures are represented as warriors, carrying weapons and on occasion
        fighting against other humans or big felines. Along with these figurative
        themes, geometric signs are very common in Ethiopian rock art, including groups
        of dots and other motifs that have been interpreted as symbols associated
        with groups that historically lived in the region.

        in the Harar region are mainly paintings, in Sidamo many figures are engraved
        in a very singular way, lowering the area around the figures to achieve a
        bas-relief effect. The clear differences between the Sidamo engravings (known

      title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 9'
      body: As is the case with most African rock art, absolute dates for depictions
        based on radiocarbon techniques are scarce, and therefore most of the chronological
        framework of Ethiopian rock art has to rely on the analysis of figures, superimpositions,
        parallels with depictions of better known areas and other indirect dating
        methods. In Ethiopian rock art it is generally assumed that the oldest depictions
        could be dated to the mid-third millennium BC, according to parallels with
        other Saharan rock art. As aforementioned, the so-called Ethiopian-Arabian
        style shows an evolution from naturalism to schematism, with an older group
        (Sourré-Hanakiya) showing strong similarities with rock art in Egypt, Sudan
        and Libya. A second, progressively schematic group (Dahtami) would last until
        the end of the first millennium BC. This date is supported by the appearance
        of camels and humped cows (zebus), which were introduced in the region at
        the end of the second half of the 1st millennium BC. The last stages of Ethiopian
        rock art relating to camel, warriors and geometric depictions can be considered
        to belong to the historical period, in some cases reaching very near to the
        present day.
