      body: The site of Shepe (also known as Chabbé, Šappe or Mancheti) is located
        in the Sidamo Zone of Oromia, about 250 km to the south of Addis Ababa. The
        region is a fertile, forest-mountainous area traditionally dedicated to the
        cultivation of coffee. The site is in a narrow gorge carved by the Shepe River
        at 1300 m above sea level, full of vegetation and therefore difficult to detect.
        Along this gorge there are several notable  engravings depicted in four panels,
        forming one of the most impressive – if secluded —  rock art sites in the
        Horn of Africa. The site was discovered in 1965 by Fitaorari Selechi Defabatchaw,
        governor of the Dilla district where the site is located, and was published
        by Francis Anfray two years later. Since that, the importance of Shepe has
        been widely recognized and some other sites with similar engravings have been
        documented in the surrounding area. This group (known generically as the Shepe-Galma
        group) constitutes one of the main areas of Ethiopian rock art, the other
        being the Laga Oda-Sourré group in the Harar region.

      body: 'The rock art of Shepe consists almost exclusively of engravings of humpless
        cows which follow very strict conventions: profile bodies, small heads with
        long horns seen from above, U-like bellies and udders very clearly depicted.
        Some of the cows have an unidentified, triangular object hanging from their
        left horn. In total, around 50 relatively large cows (40 to 70 cm in length)
        are depicted throughout the gorge walls, distributed in rows and groups to
        represent herds. The most original feature of these engravings is, however,
        the technique used to depict them: rather than carving the outline of the
        cows, the area around them has been lowered to provide a bas-relief effect
        which has no known parallels in the region. The surface of the cows has been
        polished to obtain a smooth appearance.'

      body: The chronology of the Shepe cows is difficult to determine, but stylistically
        they have been related to the Laga Oda paintings in the area of Harar and
        to other sites in Eritrea and Djibouti. According to most researchers, the
        Shepe figures have been ascribed to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabian style,
        with a generic chronology from the 3rd to the 1st millennia BC. Shepe engravings
        can be considered relatively naturalistic, and therefore should be among the
        oldest depictions of this style. Other interpretations, however, consider
        Shepe and the nearby sites a completely differentiated school whose chronology
        is still unclear but could be more recent.

      body: Regarding their meaning, only conjecture can be made at present, but it
        seems quite likely that they were made by pastoral communities to whom cattle
        were fundamental. The careful depiction of the udders, the repetition of this
        single motif and the effort paid to achieve the bas-relief effect imply a
        paramount importance of cattle in the economy and society of the group that
        engraved them. The fact that some of the cows have what seem to be adornments
        hanging from the horns (a feature documented in other rock art regions as
        the Libyan Messak) also points in that direction. Contemporary groups, such
        as the Nuer in nearby Sudan have similar traditions of horn adornments, and
        throughout the Omo river region different techniques of embellishment (ear
        cutting, horn shaping, modifications of the hump) have been documented, and
        in all of them cattle are a key cultural mark as well as an economic resource.  Of
        course, direct links cannot be established between these contemporary examples
        and the communities that made the engravings of Shepe, but the cattle depictions
        in the ravine are nevertheless a document of the importance and consideration
        given to cattle, an animal which was undoubtedly part of these groups’ identity.

      body: Ethiopia is home to some of the most impressive archaeological remains
        in Africa, such as the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela, the Axumite kingdom
        monoliths or the Gondar palaces. Most of these sites are located in northern
        Ethiopia, but to the south of the country there are also some remarkable archaeological
        remains, less well-known but which deserve attention. One of them is the dozens
        of graveyards located along the Rift Valley and marked by hundreds of stone
        stelae of different types, usually decorated. Ethiopia holds the biggest concentration
        of steale in all Africa, a testimony of the complexity of the societies which
        inhabited the Horn of Africa at the beginning of the second millennium AD.

      body: Although some of the most impressive stelae are located to the north-east
        of Ethiopia, in the region where the Axumite Kingdom flourished between the
        1st and the 10th centuries AD, the area with the highest concentration of
        stelae is to the south-west of the country, from the Manz region to the north
        of Addis Ababa to the border with Kenya. It is an extensive area which approximately
        follows the Rift Valley and the series of lakes that occupy its floor, and
        which roughly covers the Soddo, Wolayta and Sidamo regions. The region has
        a tropical climate and is fertile, with warm conditions being predominant
        and rainfall being quite abundant, with annual rates of 1200-1500 mm in the
        lower areas while in the highlands the rainfall reaches 2.000 mm per year.

      body: 'Ethiopian stelae have been known to western scholars since the end of
        the 19th century, with the first examples documented in 1885 to the north
        of Addis Ababa and the news about the main group to the south arriving in
        1905. The first archaeological works in the southern area took place in the
        1920’s carried out by French and German researchers. The work of Père Azaïs
        was especially remarkable, with four expeditions undertaken between 1922 and
        1926 which were partially published in 1931. Along with Azaïs, a German team
        from the Frobénius Institute started to study the site of Tuto Fela, a huge
        cemetery with hundreds of phallic and anthropomorphic stelae located in the
        Sidamo region. Since these early studies the archaeological remains were left
        unattended until the 1970’s, when Francis Anfray excavated the site of Gattira-Demma
        and organized a far more systematic survey in the area which documented dozens
        of stelae of different sizes and types. In the 1980’s, another French team
        started to study first Tiya and then Tuto Fela and another important site,
        Chelba-Tutitti, in a long-term project which has been going on for thirty
        years and has been paramount to understand the types, chronologies and distribution
        of these archaeological remains. The historical importance of these stelae
        was universally recognized in 1980, when Tiya was listed as a UNESCO World
        Heritage Site. '

      body: 'The Ethiopian stelae show a great variability in shapes and decorations,
        but at least three main groups could be defined. The first corresponds to
        the so-called phallic stelae, long cylindrical stones with a hemispherical
        top delimited by a groove or ring (Jossaume 2012: 97). The body of the stela
        is sometimes decorated with simple geometric patterns. A second type is known
        as anthropomorphic, with the top of the piece carved to represent a face and
        the rest of the piece decorated with crossed patterns. These two types are
        common to the east of the Rift Valley lakes, while to the south of Addis Ababa
        and to the west of these lakes several other types are present, most of them
        representing anthropomorphs but sometimes plain instead of cylindrical. These
        figures are usually classified depending on the shape and especially the features
        engraved on them –masks, pendants, swords- with the most lavishly carved considered
        the most recent. Probably the best known group is that with swords represented,
        such as those of Tiya, characterized by plain stones in which groups of swords
        (up to nineteen) are depicted along with dots and other unidentified symbols.
        Not all the stelae have these weapons, although those that don’t are otherwise
        identical in shape and have other common signs engraved on them.  Regarding
        their chronology the Ethiopian stela seem to be relatively new, dated from
        the 10th to the 13th centuries, sometimes with one type of stela superimposed
        on another and in other cases with old types being reused in later tombs.'

      body: 'Regardless of their chronology and shape, most of the stela seem to have
        a funerary function, marking the tombs of deceased which were buried in cemeteries
        sometimes reaching hundreds of graves. The information collected from sites
        of such as Tuto Fela show that not all the burials had an attached stela,
        and considering the amount of work necessary to prepare them those which had
        could be interpreted as belonging to high status people. In some cases, such
        as in Tiya, it seems evident that the stela marked the graves of important
        personalities within their communities. It is difficult to determine who the
        groups that carved these stelae were, but given their chronology it seems
        that they could have been Cushitic or Nilotic-speaking pastoralist communities
        absorbed by the Oromo expansion that took place in the sixteenth century.
        A lot of research has still to be done about these graveyards and their associated
        living spaces, and undoubtedly many groups of stelae are yet to be discovered.
        Those studied show, however, the potential interest of ancient communities
        still poorly known but which were able to develop complex societies and these
        material expressions of authority and power. '

        Central Africa is dominated by vast river systems and lakes, particularly the Congo River Basin. Characterised by hot and wet weather on both sides of the equator, central Africa has no regular dry season, but aridity increases in intensity both north and south of the equator. Covered with a forest of about 400,000 m² (1,035,920 km²), it is one of the greenest parts of the continent.  The rock art of central Africa stretches from the Zambezi River to the Angolan Atlantic coast and reaches as far north as Cameroon and Uganda. Termed the ‘schematic rock art zone’ by Desmond Clark (1959), it is dominated by finger-painted geometric motifs and designs, thought to extend back many thousands of years.

        Eastern Africa, from the Zambezi River Valley to Lake Turkana, consists largely of a vast inland plateau with the highest elevations on the continent, such as Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m above sea level) and Mount Kenya (5,199 m above sea level). Twin parallel rift valleys run through the region, which includes the world’s second largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria. The climate is atypical of an equatorial region, being cool and dry due to the high altitude and monsoon winds created by the Ethiopian Highlands. The rock art of eastern Africa is concentrated on this plateau and consists mainly of paintings that include animal and human representations. Found mostly in central Tanzania, eastern Zambia and Malawi; in comparison to the widespread distribution of geometric rock art, this figurative tradition is much more localised, and found at just a few hundred sites in a region of less than 100km in diameter.

        The rock art of East Africa, in particular the red paintings from Tanzania, was extensively studied by Mary and Louis Leakey in the 1930s and 1950s. Eric Ten Raa observed Sandawe people of Tanzania making rock paintings in the mid-20th century, and on the basis of oral traditions argued that the rock art was made for three main purposes: casual art; magic art (for hunting purposes or connected to health and fertility) and sacrificial art (to appease ancestral spirits). Subsequently, during the 1970s Fidelis Masao and Emmanuel Anati recorded numerous sites, classifying the art in broad chronological and stylistic categories, proposing tentative interpretations with regard to meaning.

        There has much debate and uncertainty about Central African rock art.  The history of the region has seen much mobility and interaction of cultural groups and understanding how the rock art relates to particular groups has been problematic. Pioneering work in this region was undertaken by Margaret Metcalfe in central Malawi in the early 1920s, Clarence van Riet Lowe visited Zambia in 1936 and attempted to provide a chronological sequence and some insight into the meaning of the rock art. Since the 1950s (Clarke, 1959), archaeologists have attempted to situate rock art within broader archaeological frameworks in order to resolve chronologies, and to categorise the art with reference to style, colour, superimposition, subject matter, weathering, and positioning of depictions within the panel (Phillipson, 1976). Building on this work, our current understanding of rock in this region has been advanced by Benjamin Smith (1995, 1997, 2001) with his work in Zambia and Malawi.

      body: "Rock art of East Africa consists mainly of paintings, most of which are
        found in central Tanzania, and are fewer in number in eastern Zambia and Malawi;
        scholars have categorised them as follows:\n\n*__Red Paintings__*:  \nRed
        paintings can be sub-divided into those found in central Tanzania and those
        found stretching from Zambia to the Indian Ocean.\nTanzanian red paintings
        include large, naturalistic animals with occasional geometric motifs. The
        giraffe is the most frequently painted animal, but antelope, zebra, elephant,
        rhino, felines and ostrich are also depicted. Later images show figures with
        highly distinctive stylised human head forms or hairstyles and body decoration,
        sometimes in apparent hunting and domestic scenes. The Sandawe and Hadza,
        hunter-gatherer groups, indigenous to north-central and central Tanzania respectively,
        claim their ancestors were responsible for some of the later art.\n\nThe area
        in which Sandawe rock art is found is less than 100km in diameter and occurs
        at just a few hundred sites, but corresponds closely to the known distribution
        of this group. There have been some suggestions that Sandawe were making rock
        art early into the 20th century, linking the art to particular rituals, in
        particular simbo; a trance dance in which the Sandawe communicate with the
        spirit world by taking on the power of an animal. The art displays a range
        of motifs and postures, features that can be understood by reference to simbo
        and to trance experiences; such as groups of human figures bending at the
        waist (which occurs during the *simbo* dance), taking on animal features such
        as ears and tails, and floating or flying; reflecting the experiences of those
        possessed in the dance."

      body: "Zambian rock art does not share any similarities with Tanzanian rock
        art and can be divided into two categories; animals (with a few depictions
        of humans), and geometric motifs. Animals are often highly stylised and superimposed
        with rows of dots. Geometric designs include, circles, some of which have
        radiating lines, concentric circles, parallel lines and ladder shapes. Predominantly
        painted in red, the remains of white pigment is still often visible. David
        Phillipson (1976) proposed that the naturalistic animals were earlier in date
        than geometric designs. Building on Phillipson’s work, Benjamin Smith studied
        ethnographic records and demonstrated that geometric motifs were made by women
        or controlling the weather.\n\n*__Pastoralist paintings__*: \nPastoralist
        paintings are rare, with only a few known sites in Kenya and other possible
        sites in Malawi. Usually painted in black, white and grey, but also in other
        colours, they include small outlines, often infilled, of cattle and are occasional
        accompanied by geometric motifs. Made during the period from 3,200 to 1,800
        years ago the practice ceased after Bantu language speaking people had settled
        in eastern Africa. Similar paintings are found in Ethiopia but not in southern
        Africa, and it has been assumed that these were made by Cushitic or Nilotic
        speaking groups, but their precise attribution remains unclear (Smith, 2013:154).\n"

        *__Late White Paintings__*:
        Commonly painted in white, or off-white with the fingers, so-called ‘Late White’ depictions include quite large crudely rendered representations of wild animals, mythical animals, human figures and numerous geometric motifs. These paintings are attributed to Bantu language speaking, iron-working farmers who entered eastern Africa about 2,000 years ago from the west on the border of Nigeria and Cameroon. Moving through areas occupied by the Batwa it is thought they learned the use of symbols painted on rock, skin, bark cloth and in sand. Chewa peoples, Bantu language speakers who live in modern day Zambia and Malawi claim their ancestors made many of the more recent paintings which they used in rites of passage ceremonies.

        *__Meat-feasting paintings__*:
        Meat-feasting shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle. The term Maa relates to a group of closely related Eastern Nilotic languages, which historically dominated the east African hinterland; and today is spoken by around a million people. During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners, but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease. Different symbols may be used for male and female animals. Over the centuries, because the depictions are on the ceiling of meat feasting rock shelters, and because sites are used even today, a build-up of soot has obscured or obliterated the paintings. Unfortunately, few have been recorded or mapped.

      title: 'Categories: CENTRAL AFRICA'
      title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 7'
      body: The rock art of central Africa is attributed to hunter-gatherers known
        as Batwa. This term is used widely in eastern central and southern Africa
        to denote any autochthonous hunter-gatherer people. The rock art of the Batwa
        can be divided into two categories which are quite distinctive stylistically
        from the Tanzanian depictions of the Sandawe and Hadza. Nearly 3,000 sites
        are currently known from within this area. The vast majority, around 90%,
        consist of finger-painted geometric designs; the remaining 10% include highly
        stylised animal forms (with a few human figures) and rows of finger dots.
        Both types are thought to date back many thousands of years. The two traditions
        co-occur over a vast area of eastern and central Africa and while often found
        in close proximity to each other are only found together at a few sites. However,
        it is the dominance of geometric motifs that make this rock art tradition
        very distinctive from other regions in Africa.

      title: Rock art in the Horn of Africa
      title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 10'
      body: "The Horn of Africa has historically been a crossroads area between the
        Eastern Sahara, the Subtropical regions to the South and the Arabic Peninsula.
        These mixed influences can be seen in many archaeological and historical features
        throughout the region, the rock art being no exception. Since the early stages
        of research in the 1930s, a strong relationship between the rock art in Ethiopia
        and the Arabian Peninsula was detected, leading to the establishment of the
        term *Ethiopian-Arabian* rock art by Pavel Červiček in 1971. This research
        thread proposes a progressive evolution from naturalism to schematism, ranging
        from the 4th-3rd millennium BC to the near past. Although the *Ethiopian-Arabian*
        proposal is still widely accepted and stylistic similarities between the rock
        art of Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen or Saudi Arabia are undeniable, recent voices
        have been raised against the term because of its excessive generalisation
        and lack of operability. In addition, recent research to the south of Ethiopia
        have started to discover new rock art sites related to those found in Uganda
        and Kenya.\n\nRegarding the main themes of the Horn of Africa rock art, cattle
        depictions seem to have been paramount, with cows and bulls depicted either
        isolated or in herds, frequently associated with ritual scenes which show
        their importance in these communities. Other animals – zebus, camels, felines,
        dogs, etc. –  are also represented, as well as rows of human figures, and
        fighting scenes between warriors or against lions. Geometric symbols are also
        common, usually associated with other depictions; and in some places they
        have been interpreted as tribal or clan marks. Both engraving and painting
        is common in most regions, with many regional variations. \n"

        Rock art in the Horn of Africa faces several challenges. One of them is the lack of consolidated chronologies and absolute dating for the paintings and engravings. Another is the uneven knowledge of rock art throughout the region, with research often affected by political unrest. Therefore, distributions of rock art in the region are steadily growing as research is undertaken in one of the most interactive areas in East Africa.

        The rock art of Central and East Africa is one of the least documented and well understood of the corpus of African rock art. However, in recent years scholars have undertaken some comprehensive reviews of existing sites and surveys of new sites to open up the debates and more fully understand the complexities of this region.

      title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 1'
      body: Ethiopia is the biggest country of the Horn of Africa, a very diverse
        country which has traditionally been a melting pot of cultures, religions
        and ethnicities, acting as a crossroads between the Nile valley region, the
        Red Sea and East Africa. Most rock art is located in the southern part of
        the country, although smaller concentrations have been documented near the
        borders with Eritrea, Sudan and Kenya. Ethiopian rock art shows strong similarities
        with other countries in the Horn of Africa as well as Sudan and mostly consists
        of cow depictions dated from the 3rd millennium onwards, although other animals,
        anthropomorphic figures and geometric symbols are also fairly common.

      title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 2'
      body: The geography of Ethiopia is varied and ranges from high plateaus to savannahs
        and deserts.   The eastern part mostly consists of a range of plateaus and
        high mountains, which in some cases reach more than 4000m above sea level.
        To the north of these mountains is Lake Tana, the biggest lake in Ethiopia
        and the source of the Blue Nile, one of the two tributaries of the Nile. The
        mountains are divided in two by the Great Rift Valley, which runs north-east

        evolution. The highlands are surrounded by tropical savannah and grassland
        regions to the west and south-west, while to the east lays the Danakil desert,
        one of the most inhospitable regions on earth. The south-eastern corner of
        Ethiopia, which borders Somalia, is a semi-desert plateau ranging from 300-1500
        m above sea level.

      body: 'Ethiopian rock art is located around two main areas: around the city
        of Harar to the east and the Sidamo region to the south-west. The first group
        comprises mainly painted depictions, while the second one is characterized
        by a bas-relief technique specific only to this area. However, rock art has
        also been discovered in other areas, such as the border with Eritrea, the
        area near Kenya and the Benishangul-Gumuz region, a lowland area along the
        border with Sudan. As research increases, it is likely that more rock art
        sites will be discovered throughout the country. In addition to these engravings
        and paintings, Ethiopia is also known for its decorated stelae, tall stone
        obelisks that are usually engraved with culturally and religiously important
        symbols. One of these places is Tiya, a burial place declared a World Heritage
        Site which has 32 richly decorated stelae. Although not strictly rock art
        in the traditional sense, they nevertheless represent one of the most interesting
        group of archaeological remains in the south of Ethiopia and demonstrate similar
        techniques to some of the engraved depictions.'

      body: Ethiopian rock art has played a key role in the Horn of Africa research,
        and the studies undertaken in this country have structured the chronologies,
        styles and interpretations of the whole region. Research started as early
        as the mid-1930s when the Abbé Henri Breuil proposed a classification of Ethiopian
        rock art through the study of the Porc-Epic and Genda-Biftou sites. This proposal
        stated a progressive evolution in eight steps from naturalism to schematism,
        and set the interpretative framework for succeeding decades. Breuil’s ideas
        were generally followed by John Desmond Clark in his synthesis of the rock
        art in the Horn of Africa in 1954, and they also appear in the work of Paolo
        Graziosi (1964). During the 1960s, research was carried out by Francis Anfray
        in the Sidamo area and by Gerard Bailloud near Harar, where a report made
        for the Ethiopian government informed about the existence of around ten rock
        art sites in the same area.

      body: Rock art research in Ethiopia has traditionally included the term Ethiopian-Arabian
        style, coined in 1971 by Červiček to show the similarities between the depictions
        found in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The existence of this
        style is currently the paradigm used in most rock art interpretations of the
        region, although some concerns have been raised due to its too generic characteristics,
        which can be found in many other parts of Africa.  The 1990s and 2000s have
        seen a remarkable increase of rock art research in the country, with the renewal
        of studies in the main areas and the beginning of research in the regions
        of Tigray and Benishangul-Gumuz.

        art humped cows and camels appear. Goats, sheep and dogs are very occasionally
        depicted, and unlike the Saharan rock art, wild animals such as giraffes and
        antelopes are scarce. Figures of cattle appear alone or in herds, and the
        depictions of cows with calves are a fairly common motif not only in Ethiopia
        but in the whole Horn of Africa.

        schematic and often distributed in rows. In some cases, the tendency to schematism
        is so pronounced that human figures are reduced to an H-like shape. Sometimes,
        human figures are represented as warriors, carrying weapons and on occasion
        fighting against other humans or big felines. Along with these figurative
        themes, geometric signs are very common in Ethiopian rock art, including groups
        of dots and other motifs that have been interpreted as symbols associated
        with groups that historically lived in the region.

        in the Harar region are mainly paintings, in Sidamo many figures are engraved
        in a very singular way, lowering the area around the figures to achieve a
        bas-relief effect. The clear differences between the Sidamo engravings (known
        as the Chabbé-Galma group) and those of the Harar (the Laga Oda-Sourré group)
        have led to criticisms about the perceived uniformity of the *Ethiopian-Arabian*

      title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 9'
      body: As is the case with most African rock art, absolute dates for depictions
        based on radiocarbon techniques are scarce, and therefore most of the chronological
        framework of Ethiopian rock art has to rely on the analysis of figures, superimpositions,
        parallels with depictions of better known areas and other indirect dating
        methods. In Ethiopian rock art it is generally assumed that the oldest depictions
        could be dated to the mid-third millennium BC, according to parallels with
        other Saharan rock art. As aforementioned, the so-called Ethiopian-Arabian
        style shows an evolution from naturalism to schematism, with an older group
        (Sourré-Hanakiya) showing strong similarities with rock art in Egypt, Sudan
        and Libya. A second, progressively schematic group (Dahtami) would last until
        the end of the first millennium BC. This date is supported by the appearance
        of camels and humped cows (zebus), which were introduced in the region at
        the end of the second half of the 1st millennium BC. The last stages of Ethiopian
        rock art relating to camel, warriors and geometric depictions can be considered
        to belong to the historical period, in some cases reaching very near to the
        present day.
