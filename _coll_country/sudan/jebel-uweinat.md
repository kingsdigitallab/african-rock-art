    body: At the nexus of Sudan, Libya and Egypt, where the borders meet at a point
      in the Eastern Sahara, a large rocky outcrop known as Jebel Uweinat peaks at
      an elevation of nearly 2,000 metres. The massif consists of a large, ring-shaped
      granite mass in the west, with sandstone plateaus in the east divided by deep
      valleys. Jebel Uweinat is so isolated that, until 1923, the proliferation of
      rock art around it had never been documented.

    title_internal: 'Sudan: featured site, chapter 2'
    body: This rock art comes in the form of paintings and engravings, commonly of
      animals and overwhelmingly of domestic cattle – 337 painted sites out of 414
      that have been counted contain depictions of cattle and cattle herds, and there
      are many further engravings of them. There is a disparity in the spread of each
      artwork technique – the engravings are predominantly at lower levels than the
      paintings, near the base of the mountain and valley floors, with the paintings
      at greater altitude. The images shown here come from Karkur Talh, the largest
      of these valleys, which lies mostly in Sudan.

    body: While cattle are ubiquitous, there are also frequent depictions of humans
      in various styles, as well as other domesticates, including goats and dogs.
      The herds of cattle clearly reflect a pastoralist existence for the artists,
      but there are also indications of hunting taking place, through engravings of
      wild antelope and dog figures, as well as many engravings of camels.

    title_internal: 'Sudan: featured site, chapter 4'
    body: This variety, and similarities to rock art sites elsewhere in the eastern
      Sahara, has led to conjecture and debate regarding the date and authorship of
      these depictions. Were the engravings and paintings made by the same people?
      Does the difference in drawing styles signify authorship by different cultures
      and at different times? The difficulties in objective dating of rock art make
      these questions difficult to answer, but it seems likely that there was a long
      tradition of painting and engraving here, with much of the ‘pastoralist’ rock
      art with cattle probably made between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago, some earlier
      styles possibly as much as 8,500 years ago, and other images such as camels
      made only about 2,000 years ago or less.

    title_internal: 'Sudan: featured site, chapter 5'
    body: Other than giraffes, the lack of large wild animals depicted (e.g. elephants)
      may indicate the climate to have been too dry for them, as during this time
      the area fluctuated in aridity, eventually becoming desert. There are, however,
      permanent springs at Jebel Uweinat and a more temperate microclimate here may
      have allowed pastoralists to subsist while the surrounding area became inhospitable.
      Indeed, despite its present remoteness, evidence suggests millennia of successive
      human presence, and as recently as the early 20th century, herders of the Toubou
      peoples were reported to be still living in the area. The camel engravings cannot
      be much older than 2,000 years, because camels were unknown in Africa before
      that, and the recent discovery of an ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription
      from the Early Middle Kingdom serves to confirm that Jebel Uweinat has never
      really been ‘undiscovered’, despite having been unknown to Western geographers
      prior to the 20th century.
