      body: The Ikom Monoliths, originally consisting of around 400-450 engraved standing
        stones and distributed around thirty communities in the Ikom area of Cross
        River State, Nigeria, are thought to be up to 1500 years old.  In more recent
        years, threatened by fire, theft, vandalism and neglect, there are now estimated
        to be less than 250.

        basaltic rock, with a few carved in sandstone and shelly limestone. Varying
        in height from 0.91-1.83m (3-6 feet) and sculpted into a phallus-shape, the
        stones share common decorative features. They depict stylised human features
        comprising two eyes, an open mouth, a head crowned with rings, a pointed beard,
        an elaborately marked navel, two hands with five fingers, a nose and a variety
        of facial markings. Emphasis is placed on the head while the rest of the body
        tapers into the base of the phallus’ shaped monolith, with limbs and legs
        suggested. They are also linearly inscribed with complex geometric motifs,
        which have been compared to the rock arts of Tanzania in that the meanings
        of the symbols are known to only the artists (UNESCO, 2007). '

        the monoliths can be found in the centre of the village or in the central
        meeting place of the village elders, but also in the uncultivated forest outside
        the villages. In each village in which they are found, the upright stones
        are positioned in circles, sometimes perfect circles, facing each other.  Some
        are slightly carved as very low reliefs, while others are inscribed engravings.

        traditional design configuration” (UNESCO 2007).

      body: |
        Local ethnographies about the Ikom monoliths are based in oral traditions and as such there are numerous meanings associated with the stones. For example, stone circles are used as places of sacrifice and community meeting places. They were created as memorials of departed heroes or beloved family members and represent powerful ancestral spirits to whom offerings are still made (Esu and Ukata, 2012:112). In addition local community leaders also ascribed religious significance of the stones whereby particular stone are dedicated to the god of harvest, the god of fertility and the god of war (Esu and Ukata, 2012:113).

        The local communities in the area value the monoliths in their traditional practices, beliefs and rituals, such as being ceremonially painted at the time of the [Yam festival](http://africanrockart.org/news/monoliths-cross-river-state-nigeria "monoliths cross river state").

      title_internal: 'Nigeria: country, chapter 1'
      body: In general, West Africa is not well known for its painted or engraved
        rock art and does not have a long history of rock art research. The scarcity
        of paintings may be predicated on the topography and more humid conditions
        of the climate, but the shortage of discovered sites to date may indicate
        that the paucity of evidence is genuine. Painted rock art occurs in the north
        of the country and comprises humpless cattle, monkeys, antelope and human
        figures, mainly painted in red. More unique sculptural forms include standing
        stones engraved with stylised faces and codified motifs, found to the south,
        and are reminiscent of the burial stelae at [Tuto Fela in Ethiopia](http://africanrockart.britishmuseum.org/#/article/country-of-standing-stones
        "Standing Stones of Ethiopia").

      body: Located in West Africa, the Federal Republic of Nigeria shares land borders
        with Benin in the west, Chad and Cameroon in the east, and Niger in the north.
        Its coastline lies in the south on the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean.
        The Niger and Benue River valleys make up Nigeria's most extensive region,
        merging into each other to form a distinctive 'Y' shape confluence.

      title: History of the research
      title_internal: 'Nigeria: country, chapter 4'
      body: |
        The existence of carved standing stones in Cross River State was first reported by an Officer of the British Administration in 1905 (Allison, 1967). In the 1960s, Philip Allison undertook extensive surveying in the area, resulting in a major publication by the Nigerian Department of Antiquities in 1968.  Research was undertaken in the run up to the Nigerian Civil War (also known as the Biafran War 1967-1970), during the course of which many of the monoliths were stolen and made their way on the international antiquities market. Today a number of these monoliths can be found in American and European museums, including [an example](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=611818&partId=1&searchText=ikom&images=on&page=1) from the British Museum.

        The painted rock art found in the northeastern region of the country was first systematically studied and documented in the late 1950s. In 1964, the site of Birnin Kudu, in present-day Jigawa State was declared a National Historical Monument, as a means to promote tourism in the country. Unfortunately, criticism that the site has not been well-maintained or managed has impeded tourism development (Mangut and Mangut, 2012:37).

      title: Themes
      title_internal: 'Nigeria: country, chapter 5'
      body: "Painted rock art sites in northern Nigeria are often located adjacent
        to lithophones, also known as rock gongs - these are rocks and boulders that
        were used as percussion instruments. Painted rock art and lithophones occur
        systematically at Birnin Kudu, “where the lithophones produce eleven different
        notes“ and are associated with female rituals that precede marriage (Le Quellec,
        2004:74). Depictions consist of humpless cattle and sheep as well as geometric
        signs. Although the original artists and meaning of the rock art are not known,
        local communities recognise them today as sacred sites and the images are
        thought to be associated with [shamanic activities](http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/africa/nigeria/birnin_kudu/index.php
        \"Documenting Rock Art in Nigeria Bradshaw Foundation\"). \n\nIn northern
        Nigeria, the painted rock art at Shira in Bauchi State consists of two traditions:
        naturalistic, consisting of humans and cattle with suckling calves, and anthropomorphic
        images. Paintings are usually executed in dark red on steep rock faces or
        overhangs (Mangut and Mangut, 2012:36). Anthropomorphic images have been found
        nearby at Geji and Birnin Kudu, and are associated with marriage and initiation
        (Vaughan, 1962). Also at Geji, subject matter is quite varied including humpless
        long-horned cattle, monkeys, horse, human figures and antelope. These are
        painted in three different styles, as solid figures, in outline, and outline
        and stripe (Mangut and Mangut, 2012:37).\n"

        In the Marghi region, paintings are made with reddish clay that is found at the bottom of the river during the dry season. Cooked to enhance the brightness of the pigment it is mixed with karite butter. The clay is however rare and as such expensive, so poorer families replace the clay with charcoal ashes, resulting in black pigments. Thus, the differences seen in the colours used for rock paintings are “not related to chronology or symbolism but only to social status” (Le Quellec, 2004:77).

        Near Geji, there is a rock shelter known as Dutzen Zane, that is visited by Fulani herders during the rainy season who peck the existing rock paintings to retrieve the pigment. The pigment is mixed with food for both humans and cattle and is consumed to protect “the fertility of the herd and the prosperity of the herders” (Le Quellec, 2004:77).  The villagers of Geji did not presume these paintings had been made by humans but had appeared naturally from the rock, and if damaged or destroyed by pecking would reappear the next day (Le Quellec, 2004:79).  Unfortunately, such practices have resulted in permanent damage or destruction of rock art.

      title_internal: 'Nigeria: country, chapter 7'
      body: Based on the depictions of both long and short-horned humpless cattle
        at Birnin Kudu, it has been suggested that paintings predate the introduction
        of humped cattle into northern Nigeria, and may be at least a thousand years
        old (Shaw 1978). However, depictions of horse at Geji have been used to suggest
        that painted rock art in Nigeria are no earlier than the 15th century BC (Mangut
        and Mangut, 2012:38). The engraved standing stones at Cross River are thought
        to be up to 1500 years old.
