    body: The Ikom Monoliths, originally consisting of around 400-450 engraved standing
      stones and distributed around thirty communities in the Ikom area of Cross River
      State, Nigeria, are thought to be up to 1500 years old.  In more recent years,
      threatened by fire, theft, vandalism and neglect, there are now estimated to
      be less than 250.

    body: 'The majority of the stones are skilfully carved in hard, medium-textured
      basaltic rock, with a few carved in sandstone and shelly limestone. Varying
      in height from 0.91-1.83m (3-6 feet) and sculpted into a phallus-shape, the
      stones share common decorative features. They depict stylised human features
      comprising two eyes, an open mouth, a head crowned with rings, a pointed beard,
      an elaborately marked navel, two hands with five fingers, a nose and a variety
      of facial markings. Emphasis is placed on the head while the rest of the body
      tapers into the base of the phallus’ shaped monolith, with limbs and legs suggested.
      They are also linearly inscribed with complex geometric motifs, which have been
      compared to the rock arts of Tanzania in that the meanings of the symbols are
      known to only the artists (UNESCO, 2007). '

    body: Known as Akwasnshi or Atal among the local Ejagham people of Cross River,
      the monoliths can be found in the centre of the village or in the central meeting
      place of the village elders, but also in the uncultivated forest outside the
      villages. In each village in which they are found, the upright stones are positioned
      in circles, sometimes perfect circles, facing each other.  Some are slightly
      carved as very low reliefs, while others are inscribed engravings.

    body: Whilst the stones seem to share common features, each monolith is unique
      in its design and execution, and are thought to “bear a complex codified iconography
      and an ancient writing, communication and graphic system composed in a complex
      traditional design configuration” (UNESCO 2007).

    title_internal: 'Nigeria: featured site, chapter 6'
    body: |
      Local ethnographies about the Ikom monoliths are based in oral traditions and as such there are numerous meanings associated with the stones. For example, stone circles are used as places of sacrifice and community meeting places. They were created as memorials of departed heroes or beloved family members and represent powerful ancestral spirits to whom offerings are still made (Esu and Ukata, 2012:112). In addition local community leaders also ascribed religious significance of the stones whereby particular stone are dedicated to the god of harvest, the god of fertility and the god of war (Esu and Ukata, 2012:113).

      The local communities in the area value the monoliths in their traditional practices, beliefs and rituals, such as being ceremonially painted at the time of the [Yam festival](http://africanrockart.org/news/monoliths-cross-river-state-nigeria "monoliths cross river state").
