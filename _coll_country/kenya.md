      body: 'Lake Victoria is the largest lake in Africa, and at 69,484km², the second
        largest in the world by surface area.   Sitting in a depression in the plateau
        between the eastern and western valley branches of the geological East African
        Rift System, its shores are in Uganda, Tanzania, and to the south-east, in
        Kenya.   Mfangano Island, rising 300m out of the lake near the Kenyan shore,
        is home to some of the most prominent rock painting sites in the country,
        featuring abstract patterned paintings thought to have been created between
        1,000 and 4,000 years ago by  hunter-gatherers.   The rock paintings on Mfangano
        Island are found at two principal sites:  in a cave near the sea known as
        Mawanga, and at a rock shelter further inland called Kwitone.'

      body: Mawanga is a roughly triangular limestone cavern, about 18m wide across
        the mouth and 12m deep.  The roof slopes sharply to the back towards a raised
        platform against the rear of the left wall, on which 12 images of concentric
        circles and spirals in white and red have been painted. Kwitone has similar
        paintings, situated at one end of a long overhang in a sandstone cliff, below
        the shoulder of a ridge.  The rock art at Kwitone is at the far end on the
        shelter wall, several metres above a cleared floor section. The paintings
        here feature 11 distinct shapes including concentric circles and oblongs.
        One of these is a prominent sunburst pattern in brown, with rays emanating
        from the outermost band. The images are larger than those at Mawanga, averaging
        around 40cm in diameter, and less faded, exhibiting more brown pigment, although
        both sites appear to reflect the same artistic tradition. These are finger
        paintings, with pigment probably made of haematite or white clay mixed with
        a natural binder such as egg white or urine. There is evidence that the surface
        may also have also been prepared prior to painting, by polishing, and that
        some of the images may have reapplied or retouched over time.

      body: The circular shapes seen here are typical of an apparent wider East and
        Central African rock art tradition featuring a preponderance of circular motifs,
        usually attributed to people known as the Batwa, a Bantu-origin name for  a
        series of culturally related groups historically living around Africa’s Great
        Lakes region and more widely throughout Central Africa.  Like the San people,
        who are known to have been the creators of most of the famous rock art of
        Southern Africa, Batwa were traditionally hunter-gatherers, and are considered
        the most ancient indigenous populations of the area. In the early 20th century,
        it was proposed that East African rock art of this tradition could have been
        the work of ancestral San people, but it is now generally assumed to be of
        Batwa origin with, for example, possible parallels to be seen in the symbolic
        iconography with contemporary barkcloth designs of the related Mbuti people
        from the Democratic Republic of Congo (Namono, 2010).

      body: 'Further examples of apparently Batwa origin rock art can be seen in neighbouring
        Uganda and Tanzania, a reminder that contemporary political borders do not
        reflect physical partitions in the spatial coverage of rock art traditions.  Lolui
        Island, about 50km north west of Mfangano Island and  in Ugandan waters, is
        another important Lake Victoria rock art environment, featuring both painting
        sites and rock gongs (sonorous natural percussive instruments with the wear
        of use) which seem to be associated with the painting sites. There are also
        numerous sets of cupules—ground circular depressions in the rocks.  Some of
        these are referred to locally as Omweso, due to their bearing some resemblance
        to  the depressions used for holding gaming pieces in the so-named local variant
        of the Mancala-type board games played widely throughout eastern Africa.  However,
        their original significance and use is unknown.   Cupule sites are also found
        on the Kenyan mainland and on Mfangano island.  Many of these are clearly
        anthropogenic, however an unusual phenomenon is to be noted in the spectacular
        array of naturally formed cupule-like depressions in the limestone of Mawanga
        cave. This may remind us to exercise caution in ascribing ‘rock art’ status
        to all apparently patterned rock formations. The cause of these multitudinous
        small depressions is so far unknown. '

      body: 'The rock art sites of the eastern Lake Victoria region retain spiritual
        connotations for the communities living around them, even if their denoted
        modern significance differs from that envisioned by the original artists.
        The modern inhabitants of Mfangano Island are the Abasuba people, a Bantu
        language-speaking group unrelated to the Batwa who have nevertheless appropriated
        the sites as arenas of spiritual importance.  Members of the Wasamo clan in
        the area around Mawanga remember their having used the site for rain making
        rituals until a few decades ago, with red and white pigment apparently representing
        the moon and sun respectively.  Soot on the cave roof may indicate other recent
        human activity there. When the archaeologist James Chaplin—who first investigated
        the Kwitone site in the 1960s—visited it later, he was told by local Wagimbe
        clan people that they also held the paintings there to be associated with
        some taboos, and connected it with ancestor worship. These beliefs reflect
        events of the recent past, as the Abasuba only moved into the area in the
        last 400 years.  This followed an earlier occupation by Luo peoples, prior
        to which habitation by the Batwa is assumed. The local importance of the sites
        is highlighted in their stewardship by the Abasuba Peace Museum, which fosters
        a continuing relationship with the sites and those who live around them. '

        The rock art of eastern Africa is characterised by a wide range of non-figurative images, broadly defined as geometric. Occurring in a number of different patterns or designs, they are thought to have been in existence in this region for thousands of years, although often it is difficult to attribute the art to particular cultural groups. Geometric rock art is difficult to interpret, and designs have been variously associated with sympathetic magic, symbols of climate or fertility and altered states of consciousness (Coulson and Campbell, 2010:220). However, in some cases the motifs painted or engraved on the rock face resemble the same designs used for branding livestock and are intimately related to people’s lives and world views in this region.

        First observed in Kenya in the 1970s with the work of Gramly (1975) at Lukenya Hill and Lynch and Robbins (1977) at Namoratung’a, some geometric motifs seen in the rock art of the region were observed to have had their counterparts on the hides of cattle of local communities. Although cattle branding is known to be  practised by several Kenyan groups, Gramly concluded that  “drawing cattle brands on the walls of rock shelters appears to be confined to the regions formerly inhabited by the Maa-speaking pastoralists or presently occupied by them”&dagger;(Gramly, 1977:117).

      body: In the case of Lukenya Hill, the rock shelters on whose walls these geometric
        symbols occur are associated with meat-feasting ceremonies. Meat-feasting
        shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are
        places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat
        in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle.
        During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were
        painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand
        their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners,
        but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease.
        Different symbols may be used for male and female animals.

      body: The sites of Namoratung’a near Lake Turkana in northern Kenya showed a
        similar visible relationship. The southernmost site is well known for its
        167 megalithic stones marking male burials on which are engraved hundreds
        of geometric motifs. Some of these motifs bear a striking resemblance to the
        brand marks that the Turkana mark on their cattle, camels, donkeys and other
        livestock in the area, although local people claim no authorship for the funerary
        engravings (Russell, 2013:4).

      body: Recent research (Russell, 2013) has shown that at Namoratung’a the branding
        of animals signifies a sense of belonging rather than a mark of ownership
        as we understand it in a modern farming context; all livestock, cattle, camel,
        goats, sheep and donkeys are branded according to species and sex (Russell,
        2013:7). Ethnographic accounts document that clan membership can only be determined
        by observing someone with their livestock (Russell, 2013:9). The symbol itself
        is not as important as the act of placing it on the animal’s skin, and local
        people have confirmed that they never mark rock with brand marks. Thus, the
        geometric motifs on the grave markers may have been borrowed by local Turkana
        to serve as identity markers, but in a different context. In the Horn of Africa,
        some geometric rock art is located in the open landscape and on graves. It
        has been suggested that these too are brand or clan marks, possibly made by
        camel keeping pastoralists to mark achievement, territory or ownership (Russell,
        2013:18). Some nomadic pastoralists, further afield, such as the Tuareg, place
        their clan marks along the routes they travel, carved onto salt blocks, trees
        and wells (Mohamed, 1990; Landais, 2001).

      body: "However, not all pastoralist geometric motifs can be associated with
        meat-feasting or livestock branding; they may have wider symbolism or be symbolic
        of something else (Russell, 2013:17).  For example, informants from the Samburu
        people reported that while some of the painted motifs found at Samburu meat-feasting
        shelters were of cattle brands, others represented female headdresses or were
        made to mark an initiation, and in some Masai shelters there are also clear
        representations of warriors’ shields.  In Uganda, a ceremonial rock in Karamoja,
        shows a dung painting consisting of large circles bisected by a cross which
        is said to represent cattle enclosures (Robbins, 1972). Geometric symbols,
        painted in fat and red ochre, on large phallic-shaped fertility stones on
        the Mesakin and Korongo Hills in south Sudan indicate the sex of the child
        to whom prayers are offered (Bell, 1936). A circle bisected by a line or circles
        bisected by two crosses represent boys. Girls are represented by a cross (drawn
        diagonally) or a slanting line (like a forward slash)(Russell, 2013: 17).\n\nAlthough
        pastoralist geometric motifs are widespread in the rock art of eastern Africa,
        attempting to find the meaning behind geometric designs is problematic. The
        examples discussed here demonstrate that motifs can have multiple authors,
        even in the same location, and that identical symbols can be the products
        of very different behaviours. \n"

        Central Africa is dominated by vast river systems and lakes, particularly the Congo River Basin. Characterised by hot and wet weather on both sides of the equator, central Africa has no regular dry season, but aridity increases in intensity both north and south of the equator. Covered with a forest of about 400,000 m² (1,035,920 km²), it is one of the greenest parts of the continent.  The rock art of central Africa stretches from the Zambezi River to the Angolan Atlantic coast and reaches as far north as Cameroon and Uganda. Termed the ‘schematic rock art zone’ by Desmond Clark (1959), it is dominated by finger-painted geometric motifs and designs, thought to extend back many thousands of years.

        Eastern Africa, from the Zambezi River Valley to Lake Turkana, consists largely of a vast inland plateau with the highest elevations on the continent, such as Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m above sea level) and Mount Kenya (5,199 m above sea level). Twin parallel rift valleys run through the region, which includes the world’s second largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria. The climate is atypical of an equatorial region, being cool and dry due to the high altitude and monsoon winds created by the Ethiopian Highlands. The rock art of eastern Africa is concentrated on this plateau and consists mainly of paintings that include animal and human representations. Found mostly in central Tanzania, eastern Zambia and Malawi; in comparison to the widespread distribution of geometric rock art, this figurative tradition is much more localised, and found at just a few hundred sites in a region of less than 100km in diameter.

        The rock art of East Africa, in particular the red paintings from Tanzania, was extensively studied by Mary and Louis Leakey in the 1930s and 1950s. Eric Ten Raa observed Sandawe people of Tanzania making rock paintings in the mid-20th century, and on the basis of oral traditions argued that the rock art was made for three main purposes: casual art; magic art (for hunting purposes or connected to health and fertility) and sacrificial art (to appease ancestral spirits). Subsequently, during the 1970s Fidelis Masao and Emmanuel Anati recorded numerous sites, classifying the art in broad chronological and stylistic categories, proposing tentative interpretations with regard to meaning.

        There has much debate and uncertainty about Central African rock art.  The history of the region has seen much mobility and interaction of cultural groups and understanding how the rock art relates to particular groups has been problematic. Pioneering work in this region was undertaken by Margaret Metcalfe in central Malawi in the early 1920s, Clarence van Riet Lowe visited Zambia in 1936 and attempted to provide a chronological sequence and some insight into the meaning of the rock art. Since the 1950s (Clarke, 1959), archaeologists have attempted to situate rock art within broader archaeological frameworks in order to resolve chronologies, and to categorise the art with reference to style, colour, superimposition, subject matter, weathering, and positioning of depictions within the panel (Phillipson, 1976). Building on this work, our current understanding of rock in this region has been advanced by Benjamin Smith (1995, 1997, 2001) with his work in Zambia and Malawi.

      body: "Rock art of East Africa consists mainly of paintings, most of which are
        found in central Tanzania, and are fewer in number in eastern Zambia and Malawi;
        scholars have categorised them as follows:\n\n*__Red Paintings__*:  \nRed
        paintings can be sub-divided into those found in central Tanzania and those
        found stretching from Zambia to the Indian Ocean.\nTanzanian red paintings
        include large, naturalistic animals with occasional geometric motifs. The
        giraffe is the most frequently painted animal, but antelope, zebra, elephant,
        rhino, felines and ostrich are also depicted. Later images show figures with
        highly distinctive stylised human head forms or hairstyles and body decoration,
        sometimes in apparent hunting and domestic scenes. The Sandawe and Hadza,
        hunter-gatherer groups, indigenous to north-central and central Tanzania respectively,
        claim their ancestors were responsible for some of the later art.\n\nThe area
        in which Sandawe rock art is found is less than 100km in diameter and occurs
        at just a few hundred sites, but corresponds closely to the known distribution
        of this group. There have been some suggestions that Sandawe were making rock
        art early into the 20th century, linking the art to particular rituals, in
        particular simbo; a trance dance in which the Sandawe communicate with the
        spirit world by taking on the power of an animal. The art displays a range
        of motifs and postures, features that can be understood by reference to simbo
        and to trance experiences; such as groups of human figures bending at the
        waist (which occurs during the *simbo* dance), taking on animal features such
        as ears and tails, and floating or flying; reflecting the experiences of those
        possessed in the dance."

      body: "Zambian rock art does not share any similarities with Tanzanian rock
        art and can be divided into two categories; animals (with a few depictions
        of humans), and geometric motifs. Animals are often highly stylised and superimposed
        with rows of dots. Geometric designs include, circles, some of which have
        radiating lines, concentric circles, parallel lines and ladder shapes. Predominantly
        painted in red, the remains of white pigment is still often visible. David
        Phillipson (1976) proposed that the naturalistic animals were earlier in date
        than geometric designs. Building on Phillipson’s work, Benjamin Smith studied
        ethnographic records and demonstrated that geometric motifs were made by women
        or controlling the weather.\n\n*__Pastoralist paintings__*: \nPastoralist
        paintings are rare, with only a few known sites in Kenya and other possible
        sites in Malawi. Usually painted in black, white and grey, but also in other
        colours, they include small outlines, often infilled, of cattle and are occasional
        accompanied by geometric motifs. Made during the period from 3,200 to 1,800
        years ago the practice ceased after Bantu language speaking people had settled
        in eastern Africa. Similar paintings are found in Ethiopia but not in southern
        Africa, and it has been assumed that these were made by Cushitic or Nilotic
        speaking groups, but their precise attribution remains unclear (Smith, 2013:154).\n"

        *__Late White Paintings__*:
        Commonly painted in white, or off-white with the fingers, so-called ‘Late White’ depictions include quite large crudely rendered representations of wild animals, mythical animals, human figures and numerous geometric motifs. These paintings are attributed to Bantu language speaking, iron-working farmers who entered eastern Africa about 2,000 years ago from the west on the border of Nigeria and Cameroon. Moving through areas occupied by the Batwa it is thought they learned the use of symbols painted on rock, skin, bark cloth and in sand. Chewa peoples, Bantu language speakers who live in modern day Zambia and Malawi claim their ancestors made many of the more recent paintings which they used in rites of passage ceremonies.

        *__Meat-feasting paintings__*:
        Meat-feasting shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle. The term Maa relates to a group of closely related Eastern Nilotic languages, which historically dominated the east African hinterland; and today is spoken by around a million people. During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners, but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease. Different symbols may be used for male and female animals. Over the centuries, because the depictions are on the ceiling of meat feasting rock shelters, and because sites are used even today, a build-up of soot has obscured or obliterated the paintings. Unfortunately, few have been recorded or mapped.

      body: The rock art of central Africa is attributed to hunter-gatherers known
        as Batwa. This term is used widely in eastern central and southern Africa
        to denote any autochthonous hunter-gatherer people. The rock art of the Batwa
        can be divided into two categories which are quite distinctive stylistically
        from the Tanzanian depictions of the Sandawe and Hadza. Nearly 3,000 sites
        are currently known from within this area. The vast majority, around 90%,
        consist of finger-painted geometric designs; the remaining 10% include highly
        stylised animal forms (with a few human figures) and rows of finger dots.
        Both types are thought to date back many thousands of years. The two traditions
        co-occur over a vast area of eastern and central Africa and while often found
        in close proximity to each other are only found together at a few sites. However,
        it is the dominance of geometric motifs that make this rock art tradition
        very distinctive from other regions in Africa.

      body: "The Horn of Africa has historically been a crossroads area between the
        Eastern Sahara, the Subtropical regions to the South and the Arabic Peninsula.
        These mixed influences can be seen in many archaeological and historical features
        throughout the region, the rock art being no exception. Since the early stages
        of research in the 1930s, a strong relationship between the rock art in Ethiopia
        and the Arabian Peninsula was detected, leading to the establishment of the
        term *Ethiopian-Arabian* rock art by Pavel Červiček in 1971. This research
        thread proposes a progressive evolution from naturalism to schematism, ranging
        from the 4th-3rd millennium BC to the near past. Although the *Ethiopian-Arabian*
        proposal is still widely accepted and stylistic similarities between the rock
        art of Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen or Saudi Arabia are undeniable, recent voices
        have been raised against the term because of its excessive generalisation
        and lack of operability. In addition, recent research to the south of Ethiopia
        have started to discover new rock art sites related to those found in Uganda
        and Kenya.\n\nRegarding the main themes of the Horn of Africa rock art, cattle
        depictions seem to have been paramount, with cows and bulls depicted either
        isolated or in herds, frequently associated with ritual scenes which show
        their importance in these communities. Other animals – zebus, camels, felines,
        dogs, etc. –  are also represented, as well as rows of human figures, and
        fighting scenes between warriors or against lions. Geometric symbols are also
        common, usually associated with other depictions; and in some places they
        have been interpreted as tribal or clan marks. Both engraving and painting
        is common in most regions, with many regional variations. \n"

        Rock art in the Horn of Africa faces several challenges. One of them is the lack of consolidated chronologies and absolute dating for the paintings and engravings. Another is the uneven knowledge of rock art throughout the region, with research often affected by political unrest. Therefore, distributions of rock art in the region are steadily growing as research is undertaken in one of the most interactive areas in East Africa.

        The rock art of Central and East Africa is one of the least documented and well understood of the corpus of African rock art. However, in recent years scholars have undertaken some comprehensive reviews of existing sites and surveys of new sites to open up the debates and more fully understand the complexities of this region.

      body: Rock art is distributed widely throughout Kenya, although historically
        rock art research has not been as extensive as in neighbouring countries such
        as Tanzania. Some of Kenya's various rock art traditions are attributed to
        or associated with the ancestors of modern regional cultural groups, and as
        such sites sometimes retain local religious importance. Both painted and engraved
        imagery tends towards the symbolic and geometric, with occasional depictions
        of schematic animals and people. It must be noted that there are still probably
        many Kenyan rock art sites which have not yet become known outside of their
        local communities, if they are known at all.

        and east and Tanzania and Uganda in the south and west. The country stretches
        from a low-lying eastern coastal strip, inland to highland regions in the
        west of the country. Kenya's western half is divided by the eastern section
        of the East African Rift, the long area of tectonic divergence which runs
        from the coasts of Djibouti, Eritrea and Somalia down through Ethiopia and
        Kenya and into Uganda, curving around the eastern edge of the Lake Victoria
        basin. There are a significant number of painted rock art sites throughout
        west-central and southern Kenya.

      body: 'Although researchers had been noting and investigating rock art in the
        neighbouring countries of Tanzania and Uganda from the early years of the
        20th Century, the first published mention of Kenyan rock art appeared only
        in 1946, with Joy Adamson''s descriptions of engravings at Surima, in the
        northern Turkana region. It was in the 1960s that sustained academic attention
        began to be paid to other sites in the country. In 1961 Richard Wright published
        an account of a rock shelter (now known as Kiptogot Cave) with painted images
        of cattle on the slopes of Mount Elgon near Kitale. Wright suggested potential
        parallels in style with some Ethiopian pastoralist rock art. In 1968 Robert
        Soper was the first archaeologist to investigate the unique Namoratung’a burial
        sites to the east of Lake Turkana, with their engraved standing stones, the
        interpretation of which would be continued with the work of Mark Lynch and
        Lawrence Robbins in the 1970s. In the same decade significant painting sites
        at Lake Victoria, north of the lake near the Ugandan border, and in the far
        south were also reported on by James Chaplin, Osaga Odak and Richard Gramly.
        Research and discovery has continued and is likely that many rock art sites
        in Kenya remain to be documented. As recently as 2005, 21 previously unknown
        rock art sites in the Samburu area of central Kenya were recorded during dedicated
        survey work organised by the British Institute in East Africa.    '

      title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 4'
      body: "Figurative imagery only features prominently in about 10% of the known
        rock art sites of Kenya.  That which exists tends to consist of very schematic
        images of cattle, wild animals and people. The majority of both painted and
        engraved rock art iconography throughout Kenya comprises symbols, with common
        patterns including circles, sometimes concentric or containing crosses, spirals,
        parallel or cross-hatched lines and curvilinear shapes.  Circular ground  depressions
        in the rock surface, known as cupules, are also a common variant of rock art
        in Kenya, along with rock gongs, which show evidence of the use of natural
        rock formations as percussive instruments.\n\nInterpretation, cultural attribution
        and proposed dates for these works vary widely across technique and area,
        although there are common themes.  It has been suggested that the schematic
        nature and similarities in the art may point to shared East African symbolic
        understandings common to different cultural groups, for example equating circular
        shapes (some of the most popular motifs in Eastern and Central African rock
        art in general) with chieftainship or the sun, or acting as navigation devices.\n\nGiven
        the variations in distance, age and nature of the sites, there is a danger
        of generalising, but there are factors which may contribute to more incisive
        interpretations of specific sites and symbols.  One set of interpretations
        for geometric shapes in Kenyan rock art points to the similarities of certain
        of these symbols to cattle brands used by Nilotic peoples throughout Kenya,
        including the Turkana, Samburu and Masai groups.  Although the engravings
        at Namoratung'a are not thought to have been made by ancestral Turkana people,
        Lynch and Robbins noted the similarities of some of the symbols found there
        to contemporary local Turkana cattle brands.  These symbols are pecked on
        stones at graves containing mens’ remains and have been proposed to represent
        male lineages, as animal brands traditionally do in contemporary Nilotic ethnic
        groups. Further south, it is known that some more recent rock paintings representing
        brand and shield patterns were made by  Masai and Samburu men, in shelters
        used for meat-feasting—a  practice forbidden in their home compounds after
        their formal initiation as warriors—or as initiation sites. Actual representations
        of cattle are rare, with the vibrant paintings at Kakapel near the Ugandan
        border the most reknowned. Their creators are unknown although Masai and Samburu
        have been known to paint occasional schematic cattle in the past.    \n"

      body: Not all of Kenya's rock art is associated with pastoralists. Much of the
        symbolic art, particularly to the south and west, is attributed to the ’Batwa’,
        ancestors of modern Batwa and related, traditionally hunter-gatherer cultural
        groups living around the Great Lakes Region of East and Central Africa.  Circular
        designs and “Sunburst” symbols are some of the most common motifs usually  associated
        with the Batwa rock art tradition; it has been proposed that they may have
        been associated  with fertility or rainmaking. Some rock art on Mfangano Island,
        in the Kenyan portion of Lake Victoria, has retained the latter association,
        having been used until the recent past by local Abasuba people for rainmaking
        purposes, despite their not having produced it originally. This re-use of
        symbolic sites in Kenya and the difficulty of dating further confuses the
        question of attribution for the art. The same rock art sites used by different
        cultural groups at different times and for different reasons. Such is the
        case at Kakapel for example, where it is posited that the earliest paintings
        may be hunter-gatherer in origin, with more recent cattle images added later,
        and Namoratung’a, with some engravings apparently hundreds of years old and
        others made within the last century.

      title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 6'
      body: It is instructive to consider the use of rock art sites within their physical
        contexts as well as the rock art motifs themselves.  Locality and landscape
        are significant, for example at Namoratung’a, where the engraved basalt pillars
        at a related nearby site have been posited to be positioned according to astronomical
        calculations, based on an ancient Cushitic calendar.  There are various ways
        in which the creation and continued use of sites in Kenya may have been significantly
        interactive, such as in the ritual playing of rock gongs, or in the potential
        use of rows of cupules as gaming boards for forms of Mancala, a token game
        common through central and Southern Africa which was originally introduced
        to Kenya via Indian Ocean trade.  It is not known if cupules were actually
        created for this purpose—it has been suggested for example that  in some areas,
        cupules were formed for purely practical purposes, in the pulverising of food
        or materials for smelting activities. In Kenya, as elsewhere, what actually
        constitutes rock art is not always easy to identify.

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 7'
      body: "Rock art ascribed to Batwa peoples could be anywhere between 15,000-1,000
        years old, while pastoralist art is more recent.  Radiocarbon dating of rock
        art is difficult unless it is buried and associated with other uncontaminated
        organic remains and as such, scientifically dated rock art from Kenya is rare.
        \ Radiocarbon dates from human remains in graves at Namoratung’a South date
        from the mid-1st Century BC to the mid-1st Millennium AD, but as dates like
        these are not directly relatable to the rock art, researchers have tended
        to concentrate on assigning chronologies based on varying levels of patination
        and style, without being able to ascribe more than estimated production dates.
        \ \n\nThere are occasionally defining limits which aid in dating  specific
        sites, for example, cattle did not arrive in Eastern Africa until about 2,000
        BC, so representations of cattle must postdate this.  In addition, in some
        cases, artworks known to have been associated with certain groups cannot have
        been produced prior to, or post, certain dates for political reasons. For
        example, Masai paintings at Lukenya Hill are known to have been painted prior
        to 1915, as Masai people were displaced from this area by European settlers
        after this date.  \n\nThe diversity of Kenyan rock art in motif, distribution
        and cultural context so far frustrates any attempts for a cohesive chronology,
        but the continuing local engagement with rock art sites in Kenya can potentially
        serve as a useful dating and interpretive resource for researchers alongside
        continuing archaeological research."
