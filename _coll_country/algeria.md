        These skilfully engraved images depict long-horned cattle with their heads bowed. Thought to date between 7,000 and 8,000 years ago, today these images stand alone in a vast wilderness of sand and rock. However, this environment was once wetter and more fertile, and this site may have been close to a local watering hole where animals regularly drank and bathed. Indeed, even today during the rains, the depression in the sand at the base of the inselberg fills up with water, which gives the appearance that the cows are bending their heads to drink.

        These engravings are incorporated in a local myth that tells of a shepherd who engraved the crying cows after travelling night and day with his herd to a spring he thought would quench their thirst. Finding it dry, he captured in stone his cattle’s grief as he watched them die one by one. Climatic data has shown a number of significant cooling events in the North Atlantic, one of which – dating to around eight thousand years ago – resulted in a period of aridity lasting a number of centuries across the Sahara, and may coincide with these engravings and of the associated myth.

      body: In artistic terms, the execution of this panel of engraved cows is extremely
        accomplished and testifies to someone who was not only a skilful carver but
        who we might even regard as a sculptor in the modern sense, who understood
        both materials and the interplay of light and shade in the reductive process
        of carving. But even more than this, the artist understood the environmental
        conditions in which he was working. It has been observed that the depth and
        thickness of the engraved lines has been carefully calculated to ensure that
        as the sun travels across them during the day, they appear to move. This sense
        of movement is made most acute as the evening shadows, falling into each groove,
        give the cattle a sense of mass and movement. Other artistic devices, such
        as double lines with recessed areas and internal polishing, evoke a perception
        of depth and density. The interplay of light and shade is consummately adept
        and dynamic, and the sculptural quality of the image sensorially evocative.
        This is the work of a practised craftsman, who demonstrates a deep of understanding
        of materials, techniques and the natural environment.

      title: Types of rock art and distribution
      title_internal: 'North Africa: regional, chapter 2'
      body: |+
        Although the styles and subjects of north African rock art vary, there are commonalities: images are most often figurative and frequently depict animals, both wild and domestic. There are also many images of human figures, sometimes with accessories such as recognisable weaponry or clothing. These may be painted or engraved, with frequent occurrences of both, at times in the same context. Engravings are generally more common, although this may simply be a preservation bias due to their greater durability.

        The physical context of rock art sites varies depending on geographical and topographical factors – for example, Moroccan rock engravings are often found on open rocky outcrops, while Tunisia’s Djebibina rock art sites have all been found in rock shelters. Rock art in the vast and harsh environments of the Sahara is often inaccessible and hard to find, and there is probably a great deal of rock art that is yet to be seen by archaeologists; what is known has mostly been documented within the last century.

      body: Although the existence of rock art throughout the Sahara was known to
        local communities, it was not until the nineteenth century that it became
        known to Europeans, thanks to explorers such as Heinrich Barth, who crossed
        the Messak Plateau in Libya in 1850, first noting the existence of engravings.
        Further explorations in the early twentieth century by celebrated travellers,
        ethnographers and archaeologists such as Hassanein Bey, Abbé Breuil, László
        Almásy, Henri Lhote and Leo Frobenius brought the rock art of Sahara, and
        northern Africa in general, to the awareness of a European public.

      body: 'The investigations of these researchers and those who have followed them
        have sought to date and attribute these artworks, with varying measures of
        success. Rock art may be associated with certain cultures through known parallels
        with the imagery in other artefacts, such as Naqada Period designs in Egyptian
        rock art that mirror those on dateable pottery. Authorship may be also guessed
        at through corroborating evidence: for example, due to knowledge of their
        chariot use, and the location of rock art depicting chariots in the central
        Sahara, it has been suggested that it was produced by – or at the same time
        as – the height of the Garamantes culture, a historical ethnic group who formed
        a local power around what is now southern Libya from 500 BC–700 AD. However,
        opportunities to anchor rock art imagery in this way to known ancient cultures
        are few and far between, and rock art is generally ascribed to anonymous hunter-gatherers,
        nomadic peoples, or pastoralists, with occasional imagery-based comparisons
        made with contemporary groups, such as the Fulani peoples.'

        Occasionally, association with writing in the form of, for example, Libyan-Berber or Arabic graffiti can give a known dating margin, but in general, lack of contemporary writing and written sources (Herodotus wrote about the Garamantes) leaves much open to conjecture.

        Other forms of (rare) circumstantial evidence, such as rock art covered by a dateable stratigraphic layer, and (more common) stylistic image-based dating have been used instead to form a chronology of Saharan rock art periods that is widely agreed upon, although dates are contested. The first stage, known as the Early Hunter, Wild Fauna or Bubalus Period, is posited at about 12,000–6,000 years ago, and is typified by naturalistic engravings of wild animals, in particular an extinct form of buffalo identifiable by its long horns.

        to 8,000 years ago) due to the large discoid heads of the painted human figures.
        Following this is the most widespread style, the Pastoral Period (around 7,500
        to 4,000 years ago), which is characterised by numerous paintings and engravings
        of cows, as well as occasional hunting scenes. The Horse Period (around 3,000
        to 2,000 years ago) features recognisable horses and chariots and the final
        Camel Period (around 2,000 years ago to present) features domestic dromedary
        camels, which we know to have been widely used across the Sahara from that
        time.

        that the area – and the time period in which rock art was produced – is extensive
        and there is significant temporal and spatial variability within and across
        sites. There are some commonalities in rock art styles and themes across the
        Sahara, but there are also regional variations and idiosyncrasies, and a lack
        of evidence that any of these were directly, or even indirectly, related.
        The engravings of weaponry motifs from Morocco and the painted ‘swimming’
        figures of the Gilf Kebir Plateau in Egypt and Sudan are not only completely
        different, but unique to their areas. Being thousands of kilometres apart
        and so different in style and composition, they serve to illustrate the limitations
        inherent in examining northern African rock art as a unit. The contemporary
        political and environmental challenges to accessing rock art sites in countries
        across the Sahara serves as another limiting factor in their study, but as
        dating techniques improve and further discoveries are made, this is a field
        with the potential to help illuminate much of the prehistory of northern Africa.\n\n"

        Historically, much of the rock art from across northern Africa has been classified according to a particular style or ‘school’ of depictions. One such category of images, known as the Libyan Warrior School or Libyan Warrior style is found predominantly in Niger. Typically, this style

        “…commonly depicts human figures, mainly armed warriors; women are very rare. The style is fairly crude and the technique unsophisticated, almost invariably a rather careless pecking. The figures, almost always presented frontally with their heads quite circular, with added lobes, or mushroom-shaped, are shown according to a symmetrical schema. Various garment decorations and feathers in the hair are common, and the warrior often holds one or two throwing-spears – the bow is almost lacking – and frequently also holds by the leading rein a typical horse; foreshortened with large hindquarters” (Muzzolini, 2001:614)

        Termed *Libyan Warriors* by French ethnographer Henri Lhote, these representations have been associated with Garamantes’ raids, possibly 2,500 years ago. Thought to be descended from Berbers and Saharan pastoralists who settled in central Libya from around 1500 BC, the Garamantes developed a thriving urban centre, with flourishing trade networks from Libya to Niger. In contrast, Francis Rodd, a military man who led two big expeditions to the Sahara in the 1920s, proposed that these figures represent Tuareg; a people reputedly of Berber descent who live a nomadic pastoralist lifestyle. They have their own script known as Tifinagh, which is thought to have Libyan roots and which is engraved onto rocks alongside other rock art depictions.

        Libyan Warrior figures are almost exclusively located in the Aïr Mountains of Niger although can also be found in the Adrar des Iforas, north-east Mali extending into Algeria.  Defining the Libyan Warrior Period chronologically is a challenge and dates are fairly fluid; the earliest dates suggested start from 5,200 years ago; it certainly coincides with the Horse period between 3,000-2,000 years ago but has also been proposed to continue throughout the Camel Period, from 2,000 years ago to present.

        From the sample of images we have as part of this collection it is clear that not all figures designated as falling under the umbrella term of Libyan Warrior style all share the same characteristics; there are similarities, differences and adjacencies even between what we may term a ‘typical’ representation. Of course, if these images span a period of 5,000 years then this may account for the variability in the depictions.

      body: However, for the majority of figures their posture is remarkably similar
        even though objects of material culture and the types of garments they wear
        may show more diversity. The overriding feature is that figures are positioned
        frontally with arms bent and raised, often displaying splayed fingers. In
        some cases figures hold weapons and shields, but some do not. Some wear obviously
        elaborate headdresses, but in others the features look more coiffure-like.
        Selected garments are decorated with geometric patterns, others are plain;
        not all wear items of personal ornamentation. Certainly, not all figures are
        associated with horses, as typically characterised. Moreover, rather than
        all being described as unsophisticated or careless, many are executed showing
        great technique and skill. So how do we start to make sense of this contradiction
        between consistency and variation?

      body: A criticism of Saharan rock art research, in comparison to that which
        has focused on other parts of Africa, is an under-theorisation of how the
        art links to past ethnic, archaeological or other identities (Smith,2013:156).
        This is tricky when dealing with past societies which were potentially nomadic,
        and where their archaeological remains are scarce. However, recent anthropological
        research may inform our thinking in this area. A member of the Wodaabe cultural
        group (nomadic cattle-herders and traders in the Sahel) on seeing a photograph
        of a Libyan-Warrior engraving and noting the dress and earrings told photographer
        Carol Beckwith that it represents a woman performing a traditional greeting
        dance with arms outstretched and about to clap (Coulson and Campbell,2001:210).

      body: "Such a comment suggests that local ethnographies might assist in an understanding
        of more recent rock art, that not all figures described as Libyan-Warrior
        may necessarily be the same; and indeed that women may not be as rare as previously
        documented. In fact, the Wodaabe have been noted to resemble figures in other
        Saharan rock art contexts (see article on Hairdressing in the Acacus).\n\nIf
        we accept that some of these representations share affinities with the Wodaabe
        then thinking about this category of images from an ethnographic perspective
        may prove productive. Moreover, the British Museum’s existing ethnographic
        collections are simultaneously a useful resource by which we can potentially
        add more meaning to the rock art images.\n\nThe Wodaabe belong to the Fulani
        people, numbering 20 million and currently living across eighteen countries.
        The Wodaabe comprise 2-3% of the Fulani cultural group, still live as true
        nomads and are considered to have the most traditional culture of all the
        Fulani (Bovin,2001:13).\t\n"

      body: "The Wodaabe have become particularly well-known in the West through visual
        anthropology, because of their emphasis on cultivating male personal beauty
        and adornment. Men invest enormous amounts of time in personal artistic expression;
        much more so than women. Anthropologists have documented the constant checking
        of Wodaabe men in their mirrors; a Wodaabe man will not even go out among
        the cows in the morning until he has checked and tidied himself. They spend
        hours every day on their appearance and have been described as styling themselves
        like “living paintings” and “living statues” (Bovin, 2001:72). Symmetry plays
        a particularly significant part in Wodaabe culture and is reflected in all
        their artistic expressions. Symmetry stands for culture, asymmetry stands
        for nature. Culture is order and nature is disorder (Bovin,2001:17). Everyday
        Wodaabe life is imbued with artistic expression, whereby “every individual
        is an active creator, decorator and performer (Bovin, 2001:15).\n\nSo, how
        might we see Wodaabe cultural traits reflected in the Libyan-Warrior figures?\n\nPlumage
        is often depicted on these Warrior figures and for the most part is assumed
        to simply be part of the warrior regalia. The ostrich feather, a phallic symbol
        in Wodaabe culture, is an important element in male adornment and is carefully
        placed in the axis of symmetry in the middle of a man’s turban, worn during
        dancing ceremonies (Bovin, 2001:41). Music and dancing are typical of Fulani
        traditions, characterized by group singing and accompanied by clapping, stomping
        and bells. The feathers in the British Museum’s collections are known to be
        dance ornaments, worn during particular ceremonies. \n"

        There is also a consensus within Wodaabe society about beauty and ugliness; what makes something beautiful or indeed ugly generally is agreed upon, there is a commonality of taste. This may account for the paradox of why there is individuality within a corpus of images that inherently are comparable (Bovin,2001:16).

        As nomads, Wodaabe do not identify themselves by place or territory as such, but a Wodaabe’s body is a repository of culture to mark them out against nature. Culture is not seen as an unessential indulgence but as an imperative necessity, it is part of one’s survival and existence in an inhospitable environment. We may speculate that rock art images may be seen as a way of stamping culture on nature; markers of socialised space.

      body: This brief review was motivated, in part, by the underlying problems inherent
        in the categorisation of visual culture. Historically assigned classifications
        are not fixed and armed with current knowledge across a range of resources
        we may provide further insights into these enigmatic representations. Obviously,
        a much more systematic study of this category known as Libyan-Warrior figures
        needs to be undertaken to determine their distribution and the similarities
        and differences between depictions across sites. Additionally, care must be
        taken making connections with a cultural group whose material culture has
        changed over the course of the twentieth century. Nevertheless, it seems the
        category of Libyan-Warrior figures is an area that is ripe for more intensive
        investigation.

      body: Libyco-Berber characters were identified as written language as early
        as the 17th century, when some inscriptions in the language were documented
        in the Roman city of Dougga (Tunisia). They were deciphered by F. de Saulcy
        in 1843 through the comparison of personal names with equivalent Punic names
        in bilingual scenes, although a few characters still remain uncertain. Since
        the beginning of the 19th century onwards different many proposals have been
        made to explain the origin, expansion and translation of these alphabets.
        There are three main explanations of its origin; the most accepted theory
        considers that the Libyco-Berber alphabet and principles of writing were borrowed
        from the Phoenician script, with other symbols added locally.

      body: A second, recent proposal has defended an indigenous (autochthonous) origin
        deriving from a stock of ancient signs –tribal tattoos, marks of ownership,
        or even geometric rock art- which could have resulted in the creation of the
        alphabet. Finally, a mixture of both theories accepts the borrowing of the
        idea of script and some Phoenician signs, which would be complemented with
        indigenous symbols. Although none of these theories can be fully accepted
        or refuted at the present moment, the proposal of a Phoenician borrowing has
        a wider support among linguistics and archaeologists.

      body: 'The study of Libyco-Berber script faces some huge challenges. In addition
        to its aforementioned variability, it is necessary to differentiate the ancient
        languages spoken and written in North Africa during the Classical Antiquity
        for which a generic term of Libyco-Berber is used. Furthermore, Tifinagh script,
        the modern script of Tuareg people shares some symbols with the Libyco-Berber
        alphabet, but otherwise is a quite different language. Contemporary Tuareg
        cannot understand the old Libyco-Berber inscriptions although they recognize
        some symbols. Chronology represents another challenge: although the first
        dated inscription on a *stela* is from 138 BC, some pottery sherds with Libyco-Berber
        symbols could date from the 3rd century BC. For some researchers the oldest
        date (as old as the 7th century BC) is believed to correspond to an engraving
        located in the Moroccan High Atlas, although that theory is still under discussion.
        Finally, the characteristics of the scripts present some problems: they are
        usually short, repetitive and in many cases incomplete. Moreover, Libyco-Berber
        can be written in different directions (from right to left, bottom to top),
        complicating the identification, transcription and translation of the inscriptions. '

      title_internal: 'Libyco-Berber: thematic, chapter 6'
      body: Considering all these problems, what do we know about Libyco-Berber scripts?
        First of all, they normally used only consonants, although due to the influence
        of Punic (the language used in areas controlled or influenced by Carthage)
        and Latin, vowels were added in some alphabet variants. The translation of
        Libyco-Berber scripts is complicated, since the existing texts are very short
        and can only be translated through comparison with equivalent texts in Punic
        or Latin. Most of the translated scripts are very simple and correspond to
        personal and site names, or fixed formulations as “X son of Y”, characteristics
        of funerary epigraphy, or others such as, “It’s me, X”.  Perhaps surprisingly,
        some of the translated inscriptions have an amorous meaning, with expressions
        as “I, X, love Y”. As the known Libyco-Berber corpus of inscriptions grows,
        it seems possible that more and more inscriptions will be translated, leading
        to a better understanding of the languages.

      body: Of course, the Libyco-Berber scripts evolved through time, although discussion
        is still going on about the chronologies and rhythms of this process. After
        the adoption and development of the alphabet, the Libyco-Berber reached a
        consideration of “official language” in the Numidian kingdom, which flourished
        in the north-western coast of Africa during the two latest centuries BC. The
        kingdom was highly influenced by Carthage and Rome, resulting in the existence
        of bilingual inscriptions that were the key to the translation of Libyco-Berber
        scripts. After Roman conquest, Libyco-Berber was progressively abandoned as
        a written language in the area, but inscriptions in the Sahara were still
        common until an unknown moment in the first millennium BC (the scripts sometimes
        receiving the name of Tifinagh). The Berber language, however, has been preserved
        and a new alphabet was developed in the 1960s to be used by Berber people.

      body: The many challenges that surround the study of Libyco-Berber scripts have
        led to a complex crossroads of terms, chronologies and theories which sometimes
        are contradictory and confusing.  For the Rock Art Image Project, a decision
        had to be made to define the painted or engraved scripts in the collection
        and the chosen term was Libyco-Berber, as most of the images are associated
        with paintings of the Horse and Camel periods and thus considered to be up
        to 3,000 years old. Using the term Tifinagh could lead to misunderstandings
        with more modern scripts and the alphabet currently used by Berber peoples
        throughout North Africa.

      body: Undoubtedly, the deciphering of forgotten languages captures the imagination
        and is one of the most exciting challenges in the study of ancient cultures.
        However, it is usually a difficult enterprise, as extraordinary finds which
        aid translation such as the Rosetta Stone are fairly exceptional and most
        of the time the transcription and translation of these languages is a long
        and difficult process in which the meaning of words and grammar rules is slowly
        unravelled. Although there are no shortcuts to this method, there are some
        initiatives that help to ease the task. One of them is making available catalogues
        of high quality images of inscriptions which can be studied and analysed by
        specialists. In that sense, the Libyco-Berber inscriptions present in the
        Rock Art Image Project catalogue can be truly helpful for all those interested
        in one of the most fascinating languages in the world; a language, which albeit
        modified  has endured in different forms for hundreds of years.

      title: Horses and chariots
      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 2'
      body: The first introduction of the domestic horse to Ancient Egypt- and thereby
        to Africa- is usually cited at around 1,600 BC, linked with the arrival in
        Egypt of the Hyksos, a group from the Levant who ruled much of Northern Egypt
        during the Second Intermediate Period. By this point, horses had probably
        only been domesticated for about 2,000 years, but with the advent of the chariot
        after the 3rd millennium BC in Mesopotamia, the horse proved to be a valuable
        martial asset in the ancient world. One of the first clear records of the
        use of horses and chariots in battle in Africa is found in depictions from
        the mortuary complex of the Pharaoh Ahmose at Abydos from around 1,525 BC,
        showing their use by Egyptians in defeating the Hyksos, and horses feature
        prominently in later Egyptian art.

      body: 'Some of the most renowned images of horses in Saharan rock art are also
        those of chariot teams: in particular, those of the so-called ‘flying gallop’
        style chariot pictures, from the Tassili n’Ajjer and Acacus mountains in modern
        Algeria and Libya. These distinctive images are characterised by depictions
        of one or more horses pulling a chariot with their legs outstretched in a
        stylised manner and are sometimes attributed to the Garamantes, a group who
        were a local power in the central Sahara from about 500 BC-700 AD. But the
        Ajjer Plateau is over a thousand miles from the Nile- how and when did the
        horse and chariot first make their way across the Western Desert to the rest
        of North Africa in the first place? Egyptian accounts indicate that by the
        11th century BC Libyans (people living on the north African coast around the
        border of modern Egypt and Libya) were using chariots in war. Classical sources
        later write about the chariots of the Garamantes and of chariot use by peoples
        of the far western Sahara continuing into the 1st century BC, by which time
        the chariot horse had largely been eclipsed in war by the cavalry mount.'

      title: Horse Riding
      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 4'
      body: As well as the unique iconography of rock art chariot depictions, there
        are also numerous paintings and engravings across northern Africa of people
        riding horses. Riding may have been practiced since the earliest times of
        horse domestication, though the earliest definitive depictions of horses being
        ridden come from the Middle East in the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia BC.
        Images of horses and riders in rock art occur in various areas of Morocco,
        Egypt and Sudan and are particularly notable in the Ennedi region of Chad
        and the Adrar and Tagant plateaus in Mauritania (interestingly, however, no
        definite images of horses are known in the Gilf Kebir/Jebel Uweinat area at
        the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya).

      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 5'
      body: Traditional chronologies for Saharan rock art areas tend to place depictions
        of ridden horses chronologically after those of horses and chariots, and in
        general use horse depictions to categorise regional stylistic periods of rock
        art according to broad date boundaries. As such, in most places, the ‘horse’
        rock art period is usually said to cover about a thousand years from the end
        of the 2nd millennium BC. It is then considered to be succeeded by a ‘camel’
        period, where the appearance of images of dromedaries – known only to have
        been introduced to the eastern Sahara from Arabia at the end of the 1st century
        BC – reflects the next momentous influx of a beast of burden to the area and
        thus a new dating parameter (read more about depictions of camels in the Sahara).
        However, such simplistic categorisation can be misleading. For one thing,
        although mounting horses certainly gained popularity over driving them, it
        is not always clear that depictions of ridden horses are not contemporary
        with those of chariots. Further, the horse remained an important martial tool
        after the use of war-chariots declined. Even after the introduction of the
        camel, there are several apparently contemporary depictions featuring both
        horse and camel riders.

      title: Berber Horses
      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 6'
      body: As the more manoeuvrable rider rose in popularity against the chariot
        as a weapon of war, historical reports from classical authors like Strabo
        tell us of the prowess of African horsemen such as the cavalry of the Numidians,
        a Berber group that allied with Carthage against the Romans in the 3rd century
        BC. Berber peoples would remain heavily associated with horse breeding and
        riding, and the later rock art of Mauritania has been attributed to Berber
        horsemen, or the sight of them. Although horses may already have reached the
        areas of modern Mauritania and Mali by this point, archaeological evidence
        does not confirm their presence in these south-westerly regions of the Sahara
        until much later, in the mid-1st millennium AD, and it has been suggested
        that some of the horse paintings in Mauritania may be as recent as 16th century.

        trans-Saharan trade routes and became items of great military value in West
        Africa following the introduction of equipment such as saddles with structured

        more recent.'

      body: 'Another intriguing possibility is that of gaining clues on the origins
        of modern horse breeds from rock art, in particular the ancient Barb breed
        native to the Maghreb, where it is still bred. Ancient Mesopotamian horses
        were generally depicted as heavily-built, and It has been suggested that the
        basic type for the delicate Arabian horse, with its dished (concave) facial
        profile and high-set tail, may have been developed in north-east Africa prior
        to its subsequent appearance and cultivation in Arabia, and that these features
        may be observed in Ancient Egyptian images from the New Kingdom. Likewise,
        there is the possibility that some of the more naturalistic paintings from
        the central Sahara show the similarly gracile features of the progenitors
        of the Barb, distinguishable from the Arab by its straight profile and low-set
        tail. Like the Arab, the Barb is a desert horse: hardy, sure-footed and able
        to withstand great heat; it is recognised as an ancient breed with an important
        genetic legacy, both in the ancestry of the Iberian horses later used throughout
        the Americas, and that of the modern racing thoroughbred.'

        alone, especially given the gulf of time that has elapsed and the relative
        paucity of ‘naturalistic’ rock art images. Indeed, there is huge diversity
        of horse depictions throughout northern Africa, with some forms highly schematic.
        This variation is not only in style – and, as previously noted, in time period
        and geography – but also in context, as of course images of one subject cannot
        be divorced from the other images around them, on whichever surface has been

      body: The nature of the depictions in this sense speaks intriguingly of the
        apparent symbolism and implied value of the horse image in different cultural
        contexts. Where some Tassilian horses are delicately painted in lifelike detail,
        the stockier images of horses associated with the so-called ‘Libyan Warrior’
        style petroglyphs of the Aïr mountains and Adrar des Ifoghas in Niger and
        Mali appear more as symbolic accoutrements to the central human figures and
        tend not to be shown as ridden. By contrast, there are paintings in the Ennedi
        plateau of Chad where galloping horse figures have clearly been painted over
        existing walking human figures to make them appear as if riding.

        In each of these cases, the original symbolic intent of the artists have been lost to time, but with these horse depictions, as with so much African rock art imagery, there is great scope for further future analysis. Particularly intriguing, for example, are the striking stylistic similarities in horse depictions across great distances, such the horse depictions with bi-triangular bodies (e.g. figs 5 &13), or with fishbone-style tails which may be found almost two thousand miles apart in Chad and Mauritania.

        Whatever the myriad circumstances and significances of the images, it is clear that following its introduction to the continent, the hardy and surefooted desert horse’s usefulness for draught, transport and fighting purposes transformed the societies which used it and gave it a powerful symbolic value.

      body: Fishing is an ancient practice in Africa, dating back 100,000 years, when
        modern humans started moving into coastal environments. The remains of thousands
        of fish bones and shellfish from sites on the southern African coastline dating
        to the Middle Stone Age testify to its antiquity. At the same time that human
        populations in Africa were developing more sophisticated terrestrial hunting
        technologies, they were also acquiring innovative and productive fishing and
        riverine hunting skills. Concomitantly, marine shells were being collected
        to thread on to twine, probably for use as items of personal ornamentation.
        Archaeological research has shown that aquatic environments have been exploited
        for both subsistence and cultural purposes for tens of thousands of years.

      body: |-
        We rarely consider the Sahara as the optimum environment for fishing. Seeing painted and engraved images of fish located in these waterless and unfavourable landscapes therefore seems at odds with our present-day knowledge of this vast desert. However, as we have noted before in these project pages (see introductions to Libya and Algeria), water-dependent animals such as crocodile and hippo have regularly been depicted in Saharan rock art, illustrating a once wetter and more fertile landscape. To date, the African rock art image project has catalogued representations of aquatic species in Libya, Algeria and Morocco, depicted with varying degrees of proficiency and ease of identification. This has been an insightful encounter, because it not only informs our thinking about the nature of the environment in the past and the way people were using their available resources, but also allows us to think about the cultural importance of water-based species.

        The rock art in these places is a glimpse into an aquatic past that is now supported by environmental evidence. In a recent collaborative project mapping ancient watercourses in the Sahara, it has been shown that during the Holocene (a period which started around 11,700 years ago), this now arid landscape was once covered by a dense interconnected river system, as well as large bodies of water known as ‘megalakes’. When these lakes overflowed, they linked catchment areas, resulting in a dense palaeoriver network that allowed water-dependent life (fish, molluscs and amphibians) to migrate and disperse across an extensive landscape. This interlinked waterway of the Sahara formed a single and vast biogeographic area. Perhaps not surprisingly, rock art sites appear to be clustered around inland deltas where resources would have been most plentiful.

        Across the Sahara, at least twenty-three species of fish have been identified in archaeological deposits from the Holocene, the most common being Tilapia, Catfish, African jewelfish, Silver fish and Nile perch. But can we go as far as to correlate the archaeological record with the rock art to species level?

        of fish are no exception. While the representations in Figs. 1 and 2 are clearly
        identifiable (and may depict a Nile perch in the former), that in Fig. 3 is
        more difficult to identify. The vertical red dots on the left of the photograph
        are arranged in a fish-like shape that converges at the top and bottom. Additionally
        it has been deliberately placed on a section of the rock face where there
        is water seepage, blending the art with the natural environment. The dotted
        pattern is reminiscent of the African jewelfish (*Hemichromis letourneauxi*)
        (Fig. 4) or even the Redbelly Tilapia (*Tilapia zillii*) (Fig. 5), both shown
        to be species of fish found throughout much of the Sahara during the Holocene.

      title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 4'
      body: Figs. 6 and 8 show engravings of fish that bear close morphological resemblances
        to Catfish, with even the barbels depicted. Catfish seem to occur more regularly
        in rock art than other species of fish, possibly due to their physical characteristics.
        They possess an auxiliary breathing organ which allows them to inhabit extremely
        de-oxygenated water; in fact, when necessary they can obtain up to 50% of
        their total oxygen requirements from the air. In some cases they will leave
        the water and crawl on dry ground to escape drying pools. This capacity to
        live in very shallow waters and to occupy the liminal spaces between land
        and water has elevated them to more than a simple food source and given them
        a place of cultural significance in many African societies.

      title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 5'
      body: In arid ecosystems, bodies of water are characterised by daily and seasonal
        fluctuations in water temperature, evaporation and other natural phenomena,
        and some fish species have adapted well to cope with these extreme changes
        in water chemistry. Catfish and Tilapia in particular are able to survive
        high salinity, which occurs through evaporation, while Redbelly Tilapia can
        also tolerate temperatures above 35° C. Both Sharptooth Catfish and Tilapia
        are floodplain dwellers and possess the ability to live and spawn in shallow
        waters, making them easily susceptible to predation. Catfish spines were also
        used to decorate Saharan pottery with dotted wavy-line patterns. These biological
        characteristics, which meant they could be easily hunted, may explain their
        frequent depiction in rock art. Perhaps their value was also reinforced by
        their being (possibly) the last fish species to survive once aridification
        had taken hold in the Sahara.

      title: Fishing
      title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 6'
      body: Fish are likely to have been caught in a variety of ways, but in the Sahara
        the most common technique was to use barbed bone point and/or fish hook technology,
        with the former being the most archaeologically visible. Barbed points may
        either be fixed – that is permanently attached to a spear or arrow shaft –
        or used as ‘harpoons’, when they separate from a shaft on impact and remain
        attached by a line. Barbed points can actually be used to catch multiple types
        of prey, but the primary use across Africa was for fish.

        in the Upper Semliki Valley in modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo,
        dating to 80,000 – 90,000 years ago. Here people were catching Catfish weighing
        up to 68 kg (150 lb), sufficient to feed eighty people for two days. Research
        has noted the distribution of barbed bone points across the Sahara, and the
        correlation between these locations and the distribution of species requiring
        deep water. It is clear that there is continuity in sophisticated fishing
        technology and practice that has lasted tens of thousands of years.

      title: Other aquatic species
      title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 8'
      body: Other aquatic species are more difficult to identify and are much rarer.
        For example, Fig 12a has been interpreted as a jelly-fish like creature. The
        photograph here has been digitally manipulated to enhance the image and on
        closer inspection However, by manipulating the colour and lighting as in Fig.
        12b, the image is a little clearer and appears to share morphological characteristics
        with a turtle rather than a jellyfish – such as the rounded carapace and small
        flippers – with a turtle rather than a jellyfish. Furthermore, we know that
        softshell turtles (*Trionyx triunguis*) have been found in archaeological
        deposits in the Sahara dating to the Holocene. The vertical and wavy strands
        hanging down underneath could represent the pattern made in the sand by turtles
        when walking rather than being the tendrils of a jellyfish. Moreover, Fig
        13 appears to resemble a snail and would be consistent with what we know about
        the Capsian culture who inhabited modern Tunisia and Algeria and parts of
        Libya during the early Holocene (10,000–6,000 BC). Their distinguishing culinary
        feature was a fondness for escargots – edible land snails.

      title: Case study – Gobero
      title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 9'
      body: A recently excavated cemetery site called Gobero (Fig. 14) (see citation),
        situated on the western edge of the Ténéré desert in Niger, provides a uniquely
        preserved record of human occupation in the Sahara during the Holocene and
        puts into context some of the examples of rock art we have looked at here.
        Pollen analysis has indicated that during the Holocene, Gobero was situated
        in an open savannah landscape of grasses and sedges, with fig trees and tamarisk,
        where permanent water and marshy habitats were present.

        Approximately 200 burials, ranging over a 5000-year period, were found on the edge of an ancient lake. Grave goods include bones or tusks from wild fauna, ceramics, lithic projectile points, and bone, ivory and shell ornaments. One adult male was buried in a recumbent pose seated on the carapace of a mud turtle. Microliths, bone harpoon points and hooks, and ceramics with dotted wavy-line and zigzag impressed motifs were found in the burial fill, in an associated midden area, and in nearby paleolake deposits. Nile perch (*Lates niloticus*), large catfish, and tilapia dominate the midden fauna, which also includes bones and teeth from hippos, several bovids, small carnivores, softshell turtles and crocodiles.

        The early Holocene occupants at Gobero (7700–6300 BC.) were largely sedentary hunter-fisher-gatherers with lakeside funerary sites. Across the ‘green’ Sahara, Catfish, Tilapia and turtles played important roles socially, economically and culturally. We can see this most explicitly in the burial within a turtle carapace in Gobero, but the representation of aquatic animals in rock art is a significant testament to their value.

      body: Yet, surprising as it seems, the camel is a relative newcomer to the Sahara
        – at least when compared to other domestic animals such as cattle, sheep,
        horses and donkeys. Although the process is not yet fully known, camels were
        domesticated in the Arabian Peninsula around the third millennium BC, and
        spread from there to the Middle East, North Africa and Somalia from the 1st
        century AD onwards. The steps of this process from Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean
        have been documented through many different historical sources, from Roman
        texts to sculptures or coins, but it is especially relevant in Saharan rock
        art, where camels became so abundant that they have given their name to a
        whole period. The depictions of camels provide an incredible amount of information
        about the life, culture and economy of the Berber and other nomadic communities
        from the beginnings of the Christian era to the Muslim conquest in the late
        years of the 7th century.

      body: 'What is it that makes camels so suited to deserts? It is not only their
        ability to transform the fat stored in their hump into water and energy, or
        their capacity to eat thorny bushes, acacia leaves and even fish and bones.
        Camels are also able to avoid perspiration by manipulating their core temperature,
        enduring fluctuations of up to six degrees that could be fatal for other mammals.
        They rehydrate very quickly, and some of their physical features (nostrils,
        eyebrows) have adapted to increase water conservation and protect the animals
        from dust and sand. All these capacities make camels uniquely suited to hot
        climates: in temperatures of 30-40 °C, they can spend up to 15 days without
        water. In addition, they are large animals, able to carry loads of up to 300kg,
        over long journeys across harsh environments. The pads on their feet have
        evolved so as to prevent them from sinking into the sand. It is not surprising
        that dromedaries are considered the ‘ships of the desert’, transporting people,
        commodities and goods through the vast territories of the Sahara.'

      body: As mentioned previously, camels came from the Arabian Peninsula through
        Egypt, where bone remains have been dated to the early 1st millennium BC.
        However, it took hundreds of years to move into the rest of North Africa due
        to the River Nile, which represented a major geographical and climatic barrier
        for these animals. The expansion began around the beginning of the Christian
        era, and probably took place both along the Mediterranean Sea and through
        the south of the Sahara. At this stage, it appears to have been very rapid,
        and during the following centuries camels became a key element in the North
        African societies. They were used mainly for riding, but also for transporting
        heavy goods and even for ploughing. Their milk, hair and meat were also used,
        improving the range of resources available to their herders. However, it seems
        that the large caravans that crossed the desert searching for gold, ivory
        or slaves came later, when the Muslim conquest of North Africa favoured the
        establishment of vast trade networks with the Sahel, the semi-arid region
        that lies south of the Sahara.

      body: Rock art can be extremely helpful in learning about the different ways
        in which camels were used in the first millennium AD. Images of camels are
        found in both engravings and paintings in red, white or – on rare occasions
        – black; sometimes the colours are combined to achieve a more impressive effect.
        They usually appear in groups, alongside humans, cattle and, occasionally,
        dogs and horses. Sometimes, even palm trees and houses are included to represent
        the oases where the animals were watered. Several of the scenes show female
        camels herded or taking care of their calves, showing the importance of camel-herding
        and breeding for the Libyan-Berber communities.

        That camels were used to transport goods is obvious, and depictions of long lines of animals are common, sometimes with saddles on which to place the packs and ropes to tie the animals together. However, if rock art depictions are some indication of camel use, it seems that until the Muslim conquest the main function of one-humped camels was as mounts, often linked to war. The Sahara desert contains dozens of astonishingly detailed images of warriors riding camels, armed with spears, long swords and shields, sometimes accompanied by infantry soldiers and horsemen. Although camels are not as good as horses for use as war mounts (they are too tall and make insecure platforms for shooting arrows), they were undoubtedly very useful in raids – the most common type of war activity in the desert – as well as being a symbol of prestige, wealth and authority among the desert warriors, much as they still are today.

        Moreover, the extraordinary detail of some of the rock art paintings has provided inestimable help in understanding how (and why) camels were ridden in the 1st millennium AD. Unlike horses, donkeys or mules, one-humped camels present a major problem for riders: where to put the saddle. Although it might be assumed that the saddle should be placed over the hump, they can, in fact, also be positioned behind or in front of the hump, depending on the activity. It seems that the first saddles were placed behind the hump, but that position was unsuitable for fighting, quite uncomfortable, and unstable. Subsequently, a new saddle was invented in North Arabia around the 5th century BC: a framework of wood that rested over the hump and provided a stable platform on which to ride and fight more effectively. The North Arabian saddle led to a revolution in the domestication of one-humped camels, allowed a faster expansion of the use of these animals, and it is probably still the most used type of saddle today.

      body: 'Although North Arabian saddles are found throughout North Africa and
        are often depicted in rock art paintings, at some point a new kind of saddle
        was designed in North Africa: one placed in front of the hump, with the weight
        over the shoulders of the camel. This type of shoulder saddle allows the rider
        to control the camel with the feet and legs, thus improving the ride. Moreover,
        the rider is seated in a lower position and thus needs shorter spears and
        swords that can be brandished more easily, making warriors more efficient.
        This new kind of saddle, which is still used throughout North Africa today,
        appears only in the western half of the Sahara and is well represented in
        the rock art of Algeria, Niger and Mauritania. And it is not only saddles
        that are recognizable in Saharan rock art: harnesses, reins, whips or blankets
        are identifiable in the paintings and show astonishing similarities to those
        still used today by desert peoples.'

      body: Since their introduction to the Sahara during the first centuries of the
        Christian era, camels have become indispensable for desert communities, providing
        a method of transport for people and commodities, but also for their milk,
        meat and hair for weaving. They allowed the improvement of wide cultural and
        economic networks, transforming the Sahara into a key node linking the Mediterranean
        Sea with Sub-Saharan Africa. A symbol of wealth and prestige, the Libyan-Berber
        peoples recognized camels’ importance and expressed it through paintings and
        engravings across the desert, leaving a wonderful document of their societies.
        The painted images of camel-riders crossing the desert not only have an evocative
        presence, they are also perfect snapshots of a history that started two thousand
        years ago and seems as eternal as the Sahara.

        for its rich concentrations of rock art, particularly in the Tassili n’Ajjer,
        inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. More than 15,000 paintings
        and engravings, some of which date back up to 12,000 years, provide unique
        insights into the environmental, social, cultural and economic changes in
        the country across a period of 10,000 or more years. The area is particularly
        famous for its Round Head paintings, first described and published in the
        1930s by French archaeologist Henry Lhote.

      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 2'
      body: Algeria is situated in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered on
        the west by Morocco and on the east by Tunisia and Libya, with a long Mediterranean
        coastline to the north. The Atlas Mountains cross Algeria east to west along
        the Mediterranean coast. The northern portion of the country is an area of
        mountains, valleys, and plateaus, but more than 80% of the country falls within
        the Sahara Desert. Rock art is located in the Algerian Maghreb and the Hoggar
        Mountains but the richest zone of rock art is located in the mountain range
        of Tassili n'Ajjer, a vast plateau in the south-east of the country. Water
        and sand erosion have carved out a landscape of thin passageways, large arches,
        and high-pillared rocks, described by Lhote as 'forests of stone'.

      title: Research history
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 3'
      body: |-
        Rock art in Algeria, notably the engravings in South Oran, has been the subject of European study since 1863. Notable surveys were made by A. Pomel (1893-1898), Stéphane Gsell (1901-1927), G. B. M. Flamand (1892-1921), Leo Frobenius and Hugo Obermaier (1925), Henri Breuil (1931-1957), L. Joleaud (1918-1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (1935-1955). Henri Lhote visited the area in 1955 and 1964, completing previous research and adding new descriptions included in a major publication on the area in 1970.

        The rock art of the Tassili region was introduced to Western eyes as a result of visits and sketches made by French legionnaires, in particular a Lt. Brenans during the 1930s. On several of his expeditions, Lt. Brenans took French archaeologist Henri Lhote who went on to revisit sites in Algeria between 1956-1970 documenting and recording the images he found. Regrettably, some previous methods of recording and/or documenting have caused damage to the vibrancy and integrity of the images.

      title: Early rock art
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 4'
      body: The earliest pieces of rock art are engraved images reflecting a past
        vibrant fertile environment teeming with life and includes elephant, rhinoceros,
        hippopotamus and fish as well as numerous predators, giraffe, and plains animals
        such as antelope and gazelle. When human figures are depicted in this period
        they are very small in stature and hold throwing sticks or axes. More than
        simply hunting scenes, they are likely to reflect people’s own place within
        their environment and their relationship with it.

      title: Round Head Period
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 5'
      body: The area is especially famous for its Round Head paintings. Thought to
        be up to 9,000 years old, some of these paintings are the largest found on
        the African continent, measuring up to 13 feet in height. The Round Head period
        comprises depictions of figures with round, featureless heads and formless
        bodies, often appearing to be ‘floating’. Some features or characteristics
        of Round Head paintings found on the Tassili plateau are unique to the area,
        and the depiction of certain motifs may have held special significance locally,
        making particular sites where they occur the locus of rites, ritual or ceremonial
        activity. The majority of animal depictions are mouflon (wild mountain sheep)
        and antelope, but they are represented only in static positions and not as
        part of a hunting scene.

      title: Pastoral Period
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 6'
      body: The subsequent Pastoral Period, from around 7,500-4,000 years ago, portrays
        a very different world to the preceding ethereal Round Head period and coincides
        with the transition from a temperate Sahara towards aridification. Images
        are stylistically varied, which may attest to the movement of different cultural
        groups. Depictions now include domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep,
        goats and dogs; scenes portray herders, men hunting with bows, and representations
        of camp life with women and children – in essence, scenes that reference more
        settled communities.

      title: Horse Period
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 7'
      body: |-
        Desertification across the Sahara required new methods of traversing and utilising the landscape; depictions of horses (often with riders) and of chariots indicate this change. Horse-drawn chariots are often depicted at a ‘flying’ gallop and are likely to have been used for hunting rather than warfare.

        Libyan-Berber script, used by ancestral Berber peoples, started to appear in association with images. However, the meaning of this juxtaposition of text and image remains an enigma, as it is indecipherable to modern day Tuareg.
