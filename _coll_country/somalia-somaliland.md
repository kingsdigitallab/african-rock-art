      body: Laas Geel, one of the most important rock art sites in the region, is
        located in the north-western part of the Horn of Africa, in Somaliland, in
        the road that links Hargeisa and Berbera. The site is placed on a granite
        outcrop that rises from a plateau at an altitude of 950 meters above sea level,
        at the confluence of two seasonal rivers, a key fact to explain the existence
        of rock art in the outcrop. Even today, the name of the site (“the camel’s
        well” in Somali) makes reference to the availability of water near the surface
        of the wadis. The panels are placed at three different levels and distributed
        mostly throughout the eastern flank of the outcrop, although isolated depictions
        can be found in other slopes.

      body: The site was discovered in 2002 by a French team led by Xavier Gutherz
        which studied the beginning of Pastoralism in the Horn of Africa. Along with
        the paintings, lithic tools were found scattered throughout the site, and
        tombs marked with stelae and mounds can be seen in the neighbourhood. The
        paintings are distributed along 20 rock shelters, the biggest being around
        10 meters long. Most of them correspond to humpless cows with curved or lyre-like
        white horns (sometimes with reddish tips) and marked udders. Paintings are
        enormously colourful, including red, white, black, violet, brown and yellow
        both isolated and combined. However, the most distinctive feature of these
        cows is their necks, depicted rectangular, abnormally wide and either blank
        or infilled with red and white stripes, either straight or wavy. These strange
        necks have been interpreted as mats hanging from the actual neck, in what
        could be interpreted as a ceremonial ornament.

        representation of herds can be made out, and they are often associated with
        human figures with a very standardized shape: frontally depicted with arms
        outstretched to the sides, and wearing a kind of shirt, usually white. Heads
        are small and sometimes surrounded by a halo of radial dashes as a crown.
        These figures always appear related to the cows, either under the neck, between
        the legs or behind the hindquarters. In some cases they carry a bow, a stick
        or a shield. Along with humans and cows, dogs are well represented too, usually
        positioned near the human figures. Other animals are much scarcer: there are
        some figures that could correspond to antelopes, monkeys and two lonely depictions
        of a giraffe. Throughout most of the panels, geometric symbols are also represented,
        often surrounding the cows.'

      body: Unlike many other rock art sites, Laas Geel has been dated quite precisely
        thanks to the excavations carried out in one of the shelters by the French
        team that documented the site. During the excavation parts of the painted
        rock wall were recovered, and therefore the archaeologists have proposed a
        chronology of mid-4th to mid-3rd millennia, being one of the oldest evidences
        of cattle domestication in the Horn of Africa and the oldest known rock art
        site in this region. Unfortunately, although bovine bones were recovered from
        the excavation, they were too poorly preserved to determine whether they correspond
        to domestic or wild animals.

      body: When discovered, Laas Geel was considered a unique site, and although
        its general characteristics corresponded to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabic
        style, its specific stylistic features had no parallels in the rock art of
        the region. As research has increased, some other sites, such as Dhaga Koure,
        Dhambalin and Karin Hagane, have provided similar depictions to those of Laas
        Geel, thus reinforcing the idea of a distinctive “Laas Geel” style which nevertheless
        must be interpreted within the broader regional context.

      body: Yet, surprising as it seems, the camel is a relative newcomer to the Sahara
        – at least when compared to other domestic animals such as cattle, sheep,
        horses and donkeys. Although the process is not yet fully known, camels were
        domesticated in the Arabian Peninsula around the third millennium BC, and
        spread from there to the Middle East, North Africa and Somalia from the 1st
        century AD onwards. The steps of this process from Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean
        have been documented through many different historical sources, from Roman
        texts to sculptures or coins, but it is especially relevant in Saharan rock
        art, where camels became so abundant that they have given their name to a
        whole period. The depictions of camels provide an incredible amount of information
        about the life, culture and economy of the Berber and other nomadic communities
        from the beginnings of the Christian era to the Muslim conquest in the late
        years of the 7th century.

      body: 'What is it that makes camels so suited to deserts? It is not only their
        ability to transform the fat stored in their hump into water and energy, or
        their capacity to eat thorny bushes, acacia leaves and even fish and bones.
        Camels are also able to avoid perspiration by manipulating their core temperature,
        enduring fluctuations of up to six degrees that could be fatal for other mammals.
        They rehydrate very quickly, and some of their physical features (nostrils,
        eyebrows) have adapted to increase water conservation and protect the animals
        from dust and sand. All these capacities make camels uniquely suited to hot
        climates: in temperatures of 30-40 °C, they can spend up to 15 days without
        water. In addition, they are large animals, able to carry loads of up to 300kg,
        over long journeys across harsh environments. The pads on their feet have
        evolved so as to prevent them from sinking into the sand. It is not surprising
        that dromedaries are considered the ‘ships of the desert’, transporting people,
        commodities and goods through the vast territories of the Sahara.'

      body: As mentioned previously, camels came from the Arabian Peninsula through
        Egypt, where bone remains have been dated to the early 1st millennium BC.
        However, it took hundreds of years to move into the rest of North Africa due
        to the River Nile, which represented a major geographical and climatic barrier
        for these animals. The expansion began around the beginning of the Christian
        era, and probably took place both along the Mediterranean Sea and through
        the south of the Sahara. At this stage, it appears to have been very rapid,
        and during the following centuries camels became a key element in the North
        African societies. They were used mainly for riding, but also for transporting
        heavy goods and even for ploughing. Their milk, hair and meat were also used,
        improving the range of resources available to their herders. However, it seems
        that the large caravans that crossed the desert searching for gold, ivory
        or slaves came later, when the Muslim conquest of North Africa favoured the
        establishment of vast trade networks with the Sahel, the semi-arid region
        that lies south of the Sahara.

      body: Rock art can be extremely helpful in learning about the different ways
        in which camels were used in the first millennium AD. Images of camels are
        found in both engravings and paintings in red, white or – on rare occasions
        – black; sometimes the colours are combined to achieve a more impressive effect.
        They usually appear in groups, alongside humans, cattle and, occasionally,
        dogs and horses. Sometimes, even palm trees and houses are included to represent
        the oases where the animals were watered. Several of the scenes show female
        camels herded or taking care of their calves, showing the importance of camel-herding
        and breeding for the Libyan-Berber communities.

        That camels were used to transport goods is obvious, and depictions of long lines of animals are common, sometimes with saddles on which to place the packs and ropes to tie the animals together. However, if rock art depictions are some indication of camel use, it seems that until the Muslim conquest the main function of one-humped camels was as mounts, often linked to war. The Sahara desert contains dozens of astonishingly detailed images of warriors riding camels, armed with spears, long swords and shields, sometimes accompanied by infantry soldiers and horsemen. Although camels are not as good as horses for use as war mounts (they are too tall and make insecure platforms for shooting arrows), they were undoubtedly very useful in raids – the most common type of war activity in the desert – as well as being a symbol of prestige, wealth and authority among the desert warriors, much as they still are today.

        Moreover, the extraordinary detail of some of the rock art paintings has provided inestimable help in understanding how (and why) camels were ridden in the 1st millennium AD. Unlike horses, donkeys or mules, one-humped camels present a major problem for riders: where to put the saddle. Although it might be assumed that the saddle should be placed over the hump, they can, in fact, also be positioned behind or in front of the hump, depending on the activity. It seems that the first saddles were placed behind the hump, but that position was unsuitable for fighting, quite uncomfortable, and unstable. Subsequently, a new saddle was invented in North Arabia around the 5th century BC: a framework of wood that rested over the hump and provided a stable platform on which to ride and fight more effectively. The North Arabian saddle led to a revolution in the domestication of one-humped camels, allowed a faster expansion of the use of these animals, and it is probably still the most used type of saddle today.

      body: 'Although North Arabian saddles are found throughout North Africa and
        are often depicted in rock art paintings, at some point a new kind of saddle
        was designed in North Africa: one placed in front of the hump, with the weight
        over the shoulders of the camel. This type of shoulder saddle allows the rider
        to control the camel with the feet and legs, thus improving the ride. Moreover,
        the rider is seated in a lower position and thus needs shorter spears and
        swords that can be brandished more easily, making warriors more efficient.
        This new kind of saddle, which is still used throughout North Africa today,
        appears only in the western half of the Sahara and is well represented in
        the rock art of Algeria, Niger and Mauritania. And it is not only saddles
        that are recognizable in Saharan rock art: harnesses, reins, whips or blankets
        are identifiable in the paintings and show astonishing similarities to those
        still used today by desert peoples.'

      body: Since their introduction to the Sahara during the first centuries of the
        Christian era, camels have become indispensable for desert communities, providing
        a method of transport for people and commodities, but also for their milk,
        meat and hair for weaving. They allowed the improvement of wide cultural and
        economic networks, transforming the Sahara into a key node linking the Mediterranean
        Sea with Sub-Saharan Africa. A symbol of wealth and prestige, the Libyan-Berber
        peoples recognized camels’ importance and expressed it through paintings and
        engravings across the desert, leaving a wonderful document of their societies.
        The painted images of camel-riders crossing the desert not only have an evocative
        presence, they are also perfect snapshots of a history that started two thousand
        years ago and seems as eternal as the Sahara.

      body: |-
        The rock art of eastern Africa is characterised by a wide range of non-figurative images, broadly defined as geometric. Occurring in a number of different patterns or designs, they are thought to have been in existence in this region for thousands of years, although often it is difficult to attribute the art to particular cultural groups. Geometric rock art is difficult to interpret, and designs have been variously associated with sympathetic magic, symbols of climate or fertility and altered states of consciousness (Coulson and Campbell, 2010:220). However, in some cases the motifs painted or engraved on the rock face resemble the same designs used for branding livestock and are intimately related to people’s lives and world views in this region.

        First observed in Kenya in the 1970s with the work of Gramly (1975) at Lukenya Hill and Lynch and Robbins (1977) at Namoratung’a, some geometric motifs seen in the rock art of the region were observed to have had their counterparts on the hides of cattle of local communities. Although cattle branding is known to be  practised by several Kenyan groups, Gramly concluded that  “drawing cattle brands on the walls of rock shelters appears to be confined to the regions formerly inhabited by the Maa-speaking pastoralists or presently occupied by them”&dagger;(Gramly, 1977:117).

      body: In the case of Lukenya Hill, the rock shelters on whose walls these geometric
        symbols occur are associated with meat-feasting ceremonies. Meat-feasting
        shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are
        places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat
        in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle.
        During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were
        painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand
        their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners,
        but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease.
        Different symbols may be used for male and female animals.

      body: The sites of Namoratung’a near Lake Turkana in northern Kenya showed a
        similar visible relationship. The southernmost site is well known for its
        167 megalithic stones marking male burials on which are engraved hundreds
        of geometric motifs. Some of these motifs bear a striking resemblance to the
        brand marks that the Turkana mark on their cattle, camels, donkeys and other
        livestock in the area, although local people claim no authorship for the funerary
        engravings (Russell, 2013:4).

      body: Recent research (Russell, 2013) has shown that at Namoratung’a the branding
        of animals signifies a sense of belonging rather than a mark of ownership
        as we understand it in a modern farming context; all livestock, cattle, camel,
        goats, sheep and donkeys are branded according to species and sex (Russell,
        2013:7). Ethnographic accounts document that clan membership can only be determined
        by observing someone with their livestock (Russell, 2013:9). The symbol itself
        is not as important as the act of placing it on the animal’s skin, and local
        people have confirmed that they never mark rock with brand marks. Thus, the
        geometric motifs on the grave markers may have been borrowed by local Turkana
        to serve as identity markers, but in a different context. In the Horn of Africa,
        some geometric rock art is located in the open landscape and on graves. It
        has been suggested that these too are brand or clan marks, possibly made by
        camel keeping pastoralists to mark achievement, territory or ownership (Russell,
        2013:18). Some nomadic pastoralists, further afield, such as the Tuareg, place
        their clan marks along the routes they travel, carved onto salt blocks, trees
        and wells (Mohamed, 1990; Landais, 2001).

      body: "However, not all pastoralist geometric motifs can be associated with
        meat-feasting or livestock branding; they may have wider symbolism or be symbolic
        of something else (Russell, 2013:17).  For example, informants from the Samburu
        people reported that while some of the painted motifs found at Samburu meat-feasting
        shelters were of cattle brands, others represented female headdresses or were
        made to mark an initiation, and in some Masai shelters there are also clear
        representations of warriors’ shields.  In Uganda, a ceremonial rock in Karamoja,
        shows a dung painting consisting of large circles bisected by a cross which
        is said to represent cattle enclosures (Robbins, 1972). Geometric symbols,
        painted in fat and red ochre, on large phallic-shaped fertility stones on
        the Mesakin and Korongo Hills in south Sudan indicate the sex of the child
        to whom prayers are offered (Bell, 1936). A circle bisected by a line or circles
        bisected by two crosses represent boys. Girls are represented by a cross (drawn
        diagonally) or a slanting line (like a forward slash)(Russell, 2013: 17).\n\nAlthough
        pastoralist geometric motifs are widespread in the rock art of eastern Africa,
        attempting to find the meaning behind geometric designs is problematic. The
        examples discussed here demonstrate that motifs can have multiple authors,
        even in the same location, and that identical symbols can be the products
        of very different behaviours. \n"

        Central Africa is dominated by vast river systems and lakes, particularly the Congo River Basin. Characterised by hot and wet weather on both sides of the equator, central Africa has no regular dry season, but aridity increases in intensity both north and south of the equator. Covered with a forest of about 400,000 m² (1,035,920 km²), it is one of the greenest parts of the continent.  The rock art of central Africa stretches from the Zambezi River to the Angolan Atlantic coast and reaches as far north as Cameroon and Uganda. Termed the ‘schematic rock art zone’ by Desmond Clark (1959), it is dominated by finger-painted geometric motifs and designs, thought to extend back many thousands of years.

        Eastern Africa, from the Zambezi River Valley to Lake Turkana, consists largely of a vast inland plateau with the highest elevations on the continent, such as Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m above sea level) and Mount Kenya (5,199 m above sea level). Twin parallel rift valleys run through the region, which includes the world’s second largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria. The climate is atypical of an equatorial region, being cool and dry due to the high altitude and monsoon winds created by the Ethiopian Highlands. The rock art of eastern Africa is concentrated on this plateau and consists mainly of paintings that include animal and human representations. Found mostly in central Tanzania, eastern Zambia and Malawi; in comparison to the widespread distribution of geometric rock art, this figurative tradition is much more localised, and found at just a few hundred sites in a region of less than 100km in diameter.

        The rock art of East Africa, in particular the red paintings from Tanzania, was extensively studied by Mary and Louis Leakey in the 1930s and 1950s. Eric Ten Raa observed Sandawe people of Tanzania making rock paintings in the mid-20th century, and on the basis of oral traditions argued that the rock art was made for three main purposes: casual art; magic art (for hunting purposes or connected to health and fertility) and sacrificial art (to appease ancestral spirits). Subsequently, during the 1970s Fidelis Masao and Emmanuel Anati recorded numerous sites, classifying the art in broad chronological and stylistic categories, proposing tentative interpretations with regard to meaning.

        There has much debate and uncertainty about Central African rock art.  The history of the region has seen much mobility and interaction of cultural groups and understanding how the rock art relates to particular groups has been problematic. Pioneering work in this region was undertaken by Margaret Metcalfe in central Malawi in the early 1920s, Clarence van Riet Lowe visited Zambia in 1936 and attempted to provide a chronological sequence and some insight into the meaning of the rock art. Since the 1950s (Clarke, 1959), archaeologists have attempted to situate rock art within broader archaeological frameworks in order to resolve chronologies, and to categorise the art with reference to style, colour, superimposition, subject matter, weathering, and positioning of depictions within the panel (Phillipson, 1976). Building on this work, our current understanding of rock in this region has been advanced by Benjamin Smith (1995, 1997, 2001) with his work in Zambia and Malawi.

        paintings can be sub-divided into those found in central Tanzania and those
        found stretching from Zambia to the Indian Ocean.\nTanzanian red paintings
        include large, naturalistic animals with occasional geometric motifs. The
        giraffe is the most frequently painted animal, but antelope, zebra, elephant,
        rhino, felines and ostrich are also depicted. Later images show figures with
        highly distinctive stylised human head forms or hairstyles and body decoration,
        sometimes in apparent hunting and domestic scenes. The Sandawe and Hadza,
        hunter-gatherer groups, indigenous to north-central and central Tanzania respectively,
        claim their ancestors were responsible for some of the later art.\n\nThe area
        in which Sandawe rock art is found is less than 100km in diameter and occurs
        at just a few hundred sites, but corresponds closely to the known distribution
        of this group. There have been some suggestions that Sandawe were making rock
        art early into the 20th century, linking the art to particular rituals, in
        particular simbo; a trance dance in which the Sandawe communicate with the
        spirit world by taking on the power of an animal. The art displays a range
        of motifs and postures, features that can be understood by reference to simbo
        and to trance experiences; such as groups of human figures bending at the
        waist (which occurs during the *simbo* dance), taking on animal features such
        as ears and tails, and floating or flying; reflecting the experiences of those
        possessed in the dance."

      body: "Zambian rock art does not share any similarities with Tanzanian rock
        art and can be divided into two categories; animals (with a few depictions
        of humans), and geometric motifs. Animals are often highly stylised and superimposed
        with rows of dots. Geometric designs include, circles, some of which have
        radiating lines, concentric circles, parallel lines and ladder shapes. Predominantly
        painted in red, the remains of white pigment is still often visible. David
        Phillipson (1976) proposed that the naturalistic animals were earlier in date
        than geometric designs. Building on Phillipson’s work, Benjamin Smith studied
        ethnographic records and demonstrated that geometric motifs were made by women
        or controlling the weather.\n\n*__Pastoralist paintings__*: \nPastoralist
        paintings are rare, with only a few known sites in Kenya and other possible
        sites in Malawi. Usually painted in black, white and grey, but also in other
        colours, they include small outlines, often infilled, of cattle and are occasional
        accompanied by geometric motifs. Made during the period from 3,200 to 1,800
        years ago the practice ceased after Bantu language speaking people had settled
        in eastern Africa. Similar paintings are found in Ethiopia but not in southern
        Africa, and it has been assumed that these were made by Cushitic or Nilotic
        speaking groups, but their precise attribution remains unclear (Smith, 2013:154).\n"

        *__Late White Paintings__*:
        Commonly painted in white, or off-white with the fingers, so-called ‘Late White’ depictions include quite large crudely rendered representations of wild animals, mythical animals, human figures and numerous geometric motifs. These paintings are attributed to Bantu language speaking, iron-working farmers who entered eastern Africa about 2,000 years ago from the west on the border of Nigeria and Cameroon. Moving through areas occupied by the Batwa it is thought they learned the use of symbols painted on rock, skin, bark cloth and in sand. Chewa peoples, Bantu language speakers who live in modern day Zambia and Malawi claim their ancestors made many of the more recent paintings which they used in rites of passage ceremonies.

        *__Meat-feasting paintings__*:
        Meat-feasting shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle. The term Maa relates to a group of closely related Eastern Nilotic languages, which historically dominated the east African hinterland; and today is spoken by around a million people. During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners, but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease. Different symbols may be used for male and female animals. Over the centuries, because the depictions are on the ceiling of meat feasting rock shelters, and because sites are used even today, a build-up of soot has obscured or obliterated the paintings. Unfortunately, few have been recorded or mapped.

      body: The rock art of central Africa is attributed to hunter-gatherers known
        as Batwa. This term is used widely in eastern central and southern Africa
        to denote any autochthonous hunter-gatherer people. The rock art of the Batwa
        can be divided into two categories which are quite distinctive stylistically
        from the Tanzanian depictions of the Sandawe and Hadza. Nearly 3,000 sites
        are currently known from within this area. The vast majority, around 90%,
        consist of finger-painted geometric designs; the remaining 10% include highly
        stylised animal forms (with a few human figures) and rows of finger dots.
        Both types are thought to date back many thousands of years. The two traditions
        co-occur over a vast area of eastern and central Africa and while often found
        in close proximity to each other are only found together at a few sites. However,
        it is the dominance of geometric motifs that make this rock art tradition
        very distinctive from other regions in Africa.

      title: Rock art in the Horn of Africa
      title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 10'
      body: "The Horn of Africa has historically been a crossroads area between the
        Eastern Sahara, the Subtropical regions to the South and the Arabic Peninsula.
        These mixed influences can be seen in many archaeological and historical features
        throughout the region, the rock art being no exception. Since the early stages
        of research in the 1930s, a strong relationship between the rock art in Ethiopia
        and the Arabian Peninsula was detected, leading to the establishment of the
        term *Ethiopian-Arabian* rock art by Pavel Červiček in 1971. This research
        thread proposes a progressive evolution from naturalism to schematism, ranging
        from the 4th-3rd millennium BC to the near past. Although the *Ethiopian-Arabian*
        proposal is still widely accepted and stylistic similarities between the rock
        art of Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen or Saudi Arabia are undeniable, recent voices
        have been raised against the term because of its excessive generalisation
        and lack of operability. In addition, recent research to the south of Ethiopia
        have started to discover new rock art sites related to those found in Uganda
        and Kenya.\n\nRegarding the main themes of the Horn of Africa rock art, cattle
        depictions seem to have been paramount, with cows and bulls depicted either
        isolated or in herds, frequently associated with ritual scenes which show
        their importance in these communities. Other animals – zebus, camels, felines,
        dogs, etc. –  are also represented, as well as rows of human figures, and
        fighting scenes between warriors or against lions. Geometric symbols are also
        common, usually associated with other depictions; and in some places they
        have been interpreted as tribal or clan marks. Both engraving and painting
        is common in most regions, with many regional variations. \n"

        Rock art in the Horn of Africa faces several challenges. One of them is the lack of consolidated chronologies and absolute dating for the paintings and engravings. Another is the uneven knowledge of rock art throughout the region, with research often affected by political unrest. Therefore, distributions of rock art in the region are steadily growing as research is undertaken in one of the most interactive areas in East Africa.

        The rock art of Central and East Africa is one of the least documented and well understood of the corpus of African rock art. However, in recent years scholars have undertaken some comprehensive reviews of existing sites and surveys of new sites to open up the debates and more fully understand the complexities of this region.

      body: Ethiopia is home to some of the most impressive archaeological remains
        in Africa, such as the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela, the Axumite kingdom
        monoliths or the Gondar palaces. Most of these sites are located in northern
        Ethiopia, but to the south of the country there are also some remarkable archaeological
        remains, less well-known but which deserve attention. One of them is the dozens
        of graveyards located along the Rift Valley and marked by hundreds of stone
        stelae of different types, usually decorated. Ethiopia holds the biggest concentration
        of steale in all Africa, a testimony of the complexity of the societies which
        inhabited the Horn of Africa at the beginning of the second millennium AD.

        of Ethiopia, in the region where the Axumite Kingdom flourished between the
        1st and the 10th centuries AD, the area with the highest concentration of
        stelae is to the south-west of the country, from the Manz region to the north
        of Addis Ababa to the border with Kenya. It is an extensive area which approximately
        follows the Rift Valley and the series of lakes that occupy its floor, and
        which roughly covers the Soddo, Wolayta and Sidamo regions. The region has
        a tropical climate and is fertile, with warm conditions being predominant
        and rainfall being quite abundant, with annual rates of 1200-1500 mm in the
        lower areas while in the highlands the rainfall reaches 2.000 mm per year.

      body: 'Ethiopian stelae have been known to western scholars since the end of
        the 19th century, with the first examples documented in 1885 to the north
        of Addis Ababa and the news about the main group to the south arriving in
        1905. The first archaeological works in the southern area took place in the
        1920’s carried out by French and German researchers. The work of Père Azaïs
        was especially remarkable, with four expeditions undertaken between 1922 and
        1926 which were partially published in 1931. Along with Azaïs, a German team
        from the Frobénius Institute started to study the site of Tuto Fela, a huge
        cemetery with hundreds of phallic and anthropomorphic stelae located in the
        Sidamo region. Since these early studies the archaeological remains were left
        unattended until the 1970’s, when Francis Anfray excavated the site of Gattira-Demma
        and organized a far more systematic survey in the area which documented dozens
        of stelae of different sizes and types. In the 1980’s, another French team
        started to study first Tiya and then Tuto Fela and another important site,
        Chelba-Tutitti, in a long-term project which has been going on for thirty
        years and has been paramount to understand the types, chronologies and distribution
        of these archaeological remains. The historical importance of these stelae
        was universally recognized in 1980, when Tiya was listed as a UNESCO World
        Heritage Site. '

        top delimited by a groove or ring (Jossaume 2012: 97). The body of the stela
        is sometimes decorated with simple geometric patterns. A second type is known

        common to the east of the Rift Valley lakes, while to the south of Addis Ababa
        and to the west of these lakes several other types are present, most of them
        representing anthropomorphs but sometimes plain instead of cylindrical. These
        figures are usually classified depending on the shape and especially the features
        engraved on them –masks, pendants, swords- with the most lavishly carved considered
        the most recent. Probably the best known group is that with swords represented,
        such as those of Tiya, characterized by plain stones in which groups of swords
        (up to nineteen) are depicted along with dots and other unidentified symbols.
        Not all the stelae have these weapons, although those that don’t are otherwise
        identical in shape and have other common signs engraved on them.  Regarding
        their chronology the Ethiopian stela seem to be relatively new, dated from
        the 10th to the 13th centuries, sometimes with one type of stela superimposed
        on another and in other cases with old types being reused in later tombs.'

      body: 'Regardless of their chronology and shape, most of the stela seem to have
        a funerary function, marking the tombs of deceased which were buried in cemeteries
        sometimes reaching hundreds of graves. The information collected from sites
        of such as Tuto Fela show that not all the burials had an attached stela,
        and considering the amount of work necessary to prepare them those which had
        could be interpreted as belonging to high status people. In some cases, such
        as in Tiya, it seems evident that the stela marked the graves of important
        personalities within their communities. It is difficult to determine who the
        groups that carved these stelae were, but given their chronology it seems
        that they could have been Cushitic or Nilotic-speaking pastoralist communities
        absorbed by the Oromo expansion that took place in the sixteenth century.
        A lot of research has still to be done about these graveyards and their associated
        living spaces, and undoubtedly many groups of stelae are yet to be discovered.
        Those studied show, however, the potential interest of ancient communities
        still poorly known but which were able to develop complex societies and these
        material expressions of authority and power. '

      title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 1'
      body: Somalia is a country located at the corner of the Horn of Africa, bordered
        by Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya. Somaliland self-declared independence from
        Somalia in 1991 although the government of Somalia has not recognised this
        and views it as an autonomous region. A cultural and economic crossroads between
        Middle East, Africa and Asia, this area has historically been the centre of
        trade routes that linked these regions. It also has a very rich rock art heritage
        which has only recently been started to be studied in depth. Most of the known
        depictions correspond to painted or engraved cattle scenes, often accompanied
        by human figures, dogs and other domestic animals, although some warriors,
        camels and geometric symbols (sometimes interpreted as tribal marks) are common
        too.

      body: 'The geography of Somaliland is characterized by a coastal semi-desert
        plain which runs parallel to the Gulf of Aden coast, crossed by seasonal rivers
        (wadis) which make possible some grazing during the rainy season. Farther
        to the south, this semi-desert plain gives rise to the Karkaar Mountains.
        These mountains, which run from Somaliland into the region of Puntland in
        Somalia, have an average height of 1800 meters above sea level and run west
        to east until Ras Caseyr (Cape Guardafui) where the north and east coasts
        of the Horn of Africa meet. Southward to the mountains there is a big, dry
        plateau known as the Ogo, whose western part (the Haud) is one of the few
        good grazing areas in the country. The Ogo plateau occupies much of central
        and eastern Somalia, which to the south is characterized by the two only permanent
        rivers in the country, the Jubba and the Shabeele, born in the Ethiopian highlands
        and running to the south. Regarding rock art, the distribution of the known
        rock art sites shows a high concentration in Somaliland, with only some sites
        located to the south in the Gobolka Hiiraan region. However, this distribution
        could be a result of lack of research in other areas. '

      title: Research history
      title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 3'
      body: A reconstruction of rock art research history is challenging due to its
        contemporary history. To begin with, during the colonial period the country
        was divided in three different territories (British, Italian and French) with
        very different trajectories, until 1960 when the British and Italian territories
        joined to create Somalia. In British Somaliland the first studies of rock
        art were carried out by Miles Burkitt and P.E. Glover in the 1940s, and the
        first general overview was published in 1954 by J.D. Clark, as a part of a
        regional synthesis of the Horn of Africa prehistory, followed by limited research
        done by Italians in the north-east region in the late 1950s. Since then, research
        has been limited, with some general catalogues published in the 1980s and
        1990s, although political instability has often prevented research, especially
        in the south-eastern region of Somalia. In fact, most rock art information
        comes from wider regional syntheses dedicated to the Horn of Africa.  In the
        early 2000’s the discovery of the Laas Geel site led to a renewed interest
        in rock art in Somaliland, which has allowed a more systematic study of archaeological
        sites. Nowadays, about 70 of these sites have been located only in this area,
        something which shows the enormous potential of rock art studies in the Horn
        of Africa.

      title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 4'
      body: The rock art has traditionally been ascribed to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabican
        style, a term coined by Pavel Červiček in 1971 to remark the strong stylistic
        relationship between the rock art found in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian
        Peninsula. According to this proposal, there was a progressive evolution from
        naturalism to schematism, perceptible in the animal depictions throughout
        the region. Wild animals seem to be largely absent but for Djibouti, while
        cattle depictions seem to have been fundamental elsewhere, either isolated
        or in herds. Such is the case with rock art in this region, where cows and
        bulls are the most common depictions, in many cases associated to human figures
        in what seems to be reverential or ritual scenes. In some of the sites, such
        as Laas Geel, the necks of the cows have been decorated with complex geometric
        patterns interpreted as a kind of mat used in special occasions to adorn them.

        dogs, sheep, dromedaries), although to a much lesser extent. Wild animals
        are very rare, but giraffes have been documented in Laas Geel and elephants
        and antelopes in Tug Gerbakele, and lions are relatively common in the schematic,
        more modern depictions. Human figures also appear, either distributed in rows
        or isolated, sometimes holding weapons. Geometric symbols are also common,
        usually associated with other depictions. In Somalia, these symbols have often
        been interpreted as tribal or clan marks. With respect to techniques, both
        engraving and painting are common, although paintings seem to be predominant.

      body: As in many other places, the establishment of accurate chronologies for
        Somaliland rock art is challenging. In this case, the lack of long term research
        has made things more difficult, and most hypotheses have been based in stylistic
        approaches, analysis of depictions and a small set of radiocarbon data and
        archaeological excavations. According to this, the oldest depictions could
        be dated to between the mid-3rd and the 2rd millennium BC, although older
        dates have been proposed for Laas Geel. This phase would be characterized
        by humpless cows, sheep and goats as well as wild animals. These sites would
        indicate the beginning of domestication in this region, the cattle being as
        a fundamental pillar of these communities. From this starting point the relative
        antiquity of the depictions would be marked by a tendency to schematism, visible
        in the superimpositions of several rock art sites. The introduction of camels
        would mark a chronology of the end of the first millennium BC, while the date
        proposed for the introduction of zebus (humped cows) should be placed at between
        the 1st Centuries BC and AD.

      body: Since the 1st millennium BC human figures armed with lances, bows and
        shields start to appear alongside the cattle, in some cases distributed in
        rows and depicting fighting scenes against other warriors or lions. The moment
        when this last period of rock art ended is unknown, but in nearby Eritrea
        some of these figures were depicted with firearms, thus implying that they
        could have reached a relatively modern date.
