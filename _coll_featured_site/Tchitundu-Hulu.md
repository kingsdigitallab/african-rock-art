    body: 'Tchitundu-Hulu is the generic name for a group of four rock art sites located
      in the Namibe province on the south-west corner of Angola, by the edge of the
      Namib desert, about 120 km from the sea.  It is a semi-arid plain characterized
      by the presence of several inselbergs (isolated hills rising from the plain),
      the most important of which is Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume.  The group of rock art
      sites are surrounded by several seasonal rivers, within a maximum distance of
      1 km.  Tchitundu-Hulu was first documented by José Camarate Andrade França in
      1953, and since then it has become one of the most studied rock art sites in
      Angola, attracting the interest of renowned researchers such as  Abbé Breuil,
      J.  Desmond Clark and Santos Junior.  In 2014 one of the sites was the subject
      of a Masters dissertation (Caema 2014), the latest addition to the long term
      research on the site.  '

      Mulume, Tchitundu-Hulu Mucai, Pedra das Zebras and Pedra da Lagoa.  The  first
      two  combine paintings and engravings, while the latter only have engravings.  Pedra
      das Zebras and Pedra da Lagoa are Portuguese names which can be translated as
      the Rock of the Zebras and the Rock of the Pond, but the name of Tchitundu-Hulu
      has different interpretations in the local languages –the hill of heaven, the
      hill of the souls or the sacred hill- while Mulume and Mucai are translated
      as man and woman, respectively.  Therefore, the local names of the site point
      to a deep meaning within the communities that inhabited the region.  '

      by large engravings, most of them consisting of circle-like shapes (simple or
      concentric circles, solar-like images), although some depictions of human figures
      or animals are also present.  On a shelter on the top of the outcrop more than
      180 images can be found painted in red or white, with geometric shapes being
      again widely predominant.  The depictions have abundant superimpositions and
      cover the walls, roof and base of the shelter.  '

    body: 'In comparison, Tchitundu-Hulu Mucai is situated on the plain around 1,000
      m from the inselberg, in a rock outcrop containing engravings on the top and
      a shelter at its base covered by painted rock art.  The characteristics of both
      engravings and paintings are similar to those of Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume, although
      some black figures are present, too.  Paintings often combine two, three or
      even more colours, and consist mainly of geometric signs, although there are
      anthropomorphs and zoomorphs, in some cases grouped in what seem hunting scenes.  The
      other two sites (the Rock of the Zebras and the Rock of the Pond) consist of
      engravings similar to those of Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume, and in some cases their
      different patinas show that they were made in different periods.  '

    body: 'The chronology of the Tchitundu-Hulu rock art is difficult to establish,
      and it is unclear if the four sites are of the same period at all.  Theories
      based on the lithic tools dispersed throughout the area ascribed the paintings
      to an ancient time period, possibly  tens of thousands of years old.  Radiocarbon
      samples coming from the excavation of Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume showed a date in
      the early 1st millennium BC, although the relation of the archaeological remains
      and the paintings has not been proved and archaeological materials of a more
      modern period were also located.  A sample taken from the pigments at the site
      rendered a date of the beginning of the first centuries of the 1st millennium
      AD.  In any case, Tchitundu-Hulu hosts some of the oldest examples of rock art
      in the country, and it has been linked to the schematic traditions that characterize
      the rock art of Central Africa, more abundant in central Mozambique and Malawi.  '

    body: The question of who made the engravings or paintings is another complex
      issue for the interpretation of the Tchitundu-Hulu depictions.  The harsh conditions
      of this semi-desert area probably favoured a seasonal occupation of the region
      during the rainy season.  The location of Tchitundu-Hulu at the edge of the
      desert could also have made this place a strategic site for the communities
      living in the region.  Several local groups - Kwisi, Kuvale - have traditionally
      inhabited the area, but the authorship of these engravings and paintings and
      the motives for creating them remains obscure, as does the purpose and cultural
      context of the complex images of Tchitundu-Hulu.
