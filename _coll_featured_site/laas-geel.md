    body: Laas Geel, one of the most important rock art sites in the region, is located
      in the north-western part of the Horn of Africa, in Somaliland, in the road
      that links Hargeisa and Berbera. The site is placed on a granite outcrop that
      rises from a plateau at an altitude of 950 meters above sea level, at the confluence
      of two seasonal rivers, a key fact to explain the existence of rock art in the
      outcrop. Even today, the name of the site (“the camel’s well” in Somali) makes
      reference to the availability of water near the surface of the wadis. The panels
      are placed at three different levels and distributed mostly throughout the eastern
      flank of the outcrop, although isolated depictions can be found in other slopes.

    body: The site was discovered in 2002 by a French team led by Xavier Gutherz which
      studied the beginning of Pastoralism in the Horn of Africa. Along with the paintings,
      lithic tools were found scattered throughout the site, and tombs marked with
      stelae and mounds can be seen in the neighbourhood. The paintings are distributed
      along 20 rock shelters, the biggest being around 10 meters long. Most of them
      correspond to humpless cows with curved or lyre-like white horns (sometimes
      with reddish tips) and marked udders. Paintings are enormously colourful, including
      red, white, black, violet, brown and yellow both isolated and combined. However,
      the most distinctive feature of these cows is their necks, depicted rectangular,
      abnormally wide and either blank or infilled with red and white stripes, either
      straight or wavy. These strange necks have been interpreted as mats hanging
      from the actual neck, in what could be interpreted as a ceremonial ornament.

    body: 'Cows appear isolated or in groups of up to fifteen, although no clear representation
      of herds can be made out, and they are often associated with human figures with
      a very standardized shape: frontally depicted with arms outstretched to the
      sides, and wearing a kind of shirt, usually white. Heads are small and sometimes
      surrounded by a halo of radial dashes as a crown. These figures always appear
      related to the cows, either under the neck, between the legs or behind the hindquarters.
      In some cases they carry a bow, a stick or a shield. Along with humans and cows,
      dogs are well represented too, usually positioned near the human figures. Other
      animals are much scarcer: there are some figures that could correspond to antelopes,
      monkeys and two lonely depictions of a giraffe. Throughout most of the panels,
      geometric symbols are also represented, often surrounding the cows.'

    body: Unlike many other rock art sites, Laas Geel has been dated quite precisely
      thanks to the excavations carried out in one of the shelters by the French team
      that documented the site. During the excavation parts of the painted rock wall
      were recovered, and therefore the archaeologists have proposed a chronology
      of mid-4th to mid-3rd millennia, being one of the oldest evidences of cattle
      domestication in the Horn of Africa and the oldest known rock art site in this
      region. Unfortunately, although bovine bones were recovered from the excavation,
      they were too poorly preserved to determine whether they correspond to domestic
      or wild animals.

    body: When discovered, Laas Geel was considered a unique site, and although its
      general characteristics corresponded to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabic style,
      its specific stylistic features had no parallels in the rock art of the region.
      As research has increased, some other sites, such as Dhaga Koure, Dhambalin
      and Karin Hagane, have provided similar depictions to those of Laas Geel, thus
      reinforcing the idea of a distinctive “Laas Geel” style which nevertheless must
      be interpreted within the broader regional context.

      still waiting to be discovered and studied. Not only the quality of the images
      depicted is astonishing, but the archaeological data associated with the site
      and the landscape itself help to reconstruct a key episode in human history
      elsewhere: the moment in which animals started to be domesticated. The strong
      symbolism which surrounds the figures of cows and humans is a permanent testimony
      of the reverence these communities paid to the animals that provided their sustenance.'
