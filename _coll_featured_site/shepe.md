    body: The site of Shepe (also known as Chabbé, Šappe or Mancheti) is located in
      the Sidamo Zone of Oromia, about 250 km to the south of Addis Ababa. The region
      is a fertile, forest-mountainous area traditionally dedicated to the cultivation
      of coffee. The site is in a narrow gorge carved by the Shepe River at 1300 m
      above sea level, full of vegetation and therefore difficult to detect. Along
      this gorge there are several notable  engravings depicted in four panels, forming
      one of the most impressive – if secluded —  rock art sites in the Horn of Africa.
      The site was discovered in 1965 by Fitaorari Selechi Defabatchaw, governor of
      the Dilla district where the site is located, and was published by Francis Anfray
      two years later. Since that, the importance of Shepe has been widely recognized
      and some other sites with similar engravings have been documented in the surrounding
      area. This group (known generically as the Shepe-Galma group) constitutes one
      of the main areas of Ethiopian rock art, the other being the Laga Oda-Sourré
      group in the Harar region.

    body: 'The rock art of Shepe consists almost exclusively of engravings of humpless
      cows which follow very strict conventions: profile bodies, small heads with
      long horns seen from above, U-like bellies and udders very clearly depicted.
      Some of the cows have an unidentified, triangular object hanging from their
      left horn. In total, around 50 relatively large cows (40 to 70 cm in length)
      are depicted throughout the gorge walls, distributed in rows and groups to represent
      herds. The most original feature of these engravings is, however, the technique
      used to depict them: rather than carving the outline of the cows, the area around
      them has been lowered to provide a bas-relief effect which has no known parallels
      in the region. The surface of the cows has been polished to obtain a smooth
      appearance.'

    body: The chronology of the Shepe cows is difficult to determine, but stylistically
      they have been related to the Laga Oda paintings in the area of Harar and to
      other sites in Eritrea and Djibouti. According to most researchers, the Shepe
      figures have been ascribed to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabian style, with a
      generic chronology from the 3rd to the 1st millennia BC. Shepe engravings can
      be considered relatively naturalistic, and therefore should be among the oldest
      depictions of this style. Other interpretations, however, consider Shepe and
      the nearby sites a completely differentiated school whose chronology is still
      unclear but could be more recent.

    body: Regarding their meaning, only conjecture can be made at present, but it
      seems quite likely that they were made by pastoral communities to whom cattle
      were fundamental. The careful depiction of the udders, the repetition of this
      single motif and the effort paid to achieve the bas-relief effect imply a paramount
      importance of cattle in the economy and society of the group that engraved them.
      The fact that some of the cows have what seem to be adornments hanging from
      the horns (a feature documented in other rock art regions as the Libyan Messak)
      also points in that direction. Contemporary groups, such as the Nuer in nearby
      Sudan have similar traditions of horn adornments, and throughout the Omo river
      region different techniques of embellishment (ear cutting, horn shaping, modifications
      of the hump) have been documented, and in all of them cattle are a key cultural
      mark as well as an economic resource.  Of course, direct links cannot be established
      between these contemporary examples and the communities that made the engravings
      of Shepe, but the cattle depictions in the ravine are nevertheless a document
      of the importance and consideration given to cattle, an animal which was undoubtedly
      part of these groups’ identity.
