    body: 'The proliferation of rock engravings at Twyfelfontein | /Ui-//aes in the
      north-west of central Namibia, forms the largest single grouping of ancient
      engraved images in southern Africa.  Covering about 57 hectares in the core
      area and home to over 2,000 engravings, the rock art sites are situated near
      a small but permanent spring. The site was first formally noted by Reinhard
      Maack in a 1921 report to the Administrator of South West Africa, following
      a report to him from a surveyor named Volkmann mentioning the engravings, near
      a spring Volkmann named as Uais (/Ui-//aes= place among rocks or jumping waterhole
      in Khoekhoegowab, the language of the local Damara people).  Later, the land
      came into the use of farmer David Levin, whose concern over the survival of
      the spring led ultimately to its being referred to as Twyfelfontein (‘doubtful
      spring’ in Afrikaans). In 1963 Ernst Scherz visited the site as part of his
      work to record rock art sites throughout South West Africa.  Scherz documented
      around 2,500 images in the wider valley area, while a 2005 survey of the core
      site found 2,075 individual images on 235 separate rock surfaces.  '

    body: The engravings are found in several loose conglomerations, on sandstone
      surfaces at the base of a hill scarp within the basin of the ephemeral Huab
      River, while the few painted panels in the area are found on the underside of
      sandstone rock overhangs.  The engraved images are pecked and/or ground/polished
      and are made in a variety of styles, with ubiquitous geometric patterns of cross-hatched,
      looped and linear forms, as well as circles and polished depressions and cupules.  In
      addition there are numerous depictions of animals, ranging in style from more
      naturalistic to stylised and distorted.  Chief among the animal images is the
      giraffe, which is most numerous.  Also common are images of rhinoceroses, zebra,
      gemsbok antelope and ostriches.  There are occasional depictions of cattle but
      images of human beings are almost absent.  Also featured are images of human
      footprints and animal spoor (hoof and paw prints).

    body: The figurative images in the engraved art feature several different distinct
      styles, ranging from very naturalistic outlines of animals such as giraffes
      and rhinoceroses, through carefully delineated but stylised or distorted renditions
      of these animals with exaggerated extremities, to very schematic pecked outlines.  One
      particular aspect of style is a form of relief engraving, whereby in some deeply
      pecked figures' muscle masses are delineated.  In others, the infill pecking
      is graded and  sparser in the centre of a figure, giving the impression of shading.  A
      few of the engravings are highly polished.  Perhaps most renowned among these
      is the “dancing kudu” image, a stylised image of a kudu antelope cow rendered
      atop a flat slab of rock and surrounded by geometric shapes.

    body: "It appears that the kudu figure is pregnant and it has been suggested that
      the choice of this animal may have been made in relation to female initiation
      practices. This is because the female kudu has a symbolic importance relating
      to women’s behaviour in the cosmology of some San|Bushman¹ people, traditionally
      hunter-gatherer people whose ancestors are thought to have made most of southern
      Africa’s rock paintings and engravings.  Other animals known to have symbolic
      and metaphorical significance to San|Bushman people are also depicted here (giraffe
      images are most numerous) and these images have been interpreted in the vein
      of other southern African rock art sites, where images are thought to reflect
      the experiences of shamans while in a trance state, and may have multiple metaphorical
      and other cultural meanings.  \n\nThe engravings were certainly made in strategic
      locations and not simply on any available rock surface, with some images having
      been deliberately made in places that are difficult to reach and to see.  The
      reason for this is unclear, though it has been suggested that such placement
      might be in relation to the images serving a preparatory function for shamans
      preparing to enter a trance.  Some of the engravings have exaggerated features
      such as elongated limbs and extremities which may reflect trance experience.
      \ One of the engravings appears to depict a lion with pugmarks (paw prints)
      instead of feet and third at the end of the tail.  Each of those in the feet
      have five instead of the correct four pads and this has been interpreted as
      meaning that the figure represents a human shaman in trance who has taken on
      lion form.  A similar suggestion has been made regarding the frequent depictions
      of ostriches (Kinahan, 2006).  \n\n¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to
      describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern
      Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions. Both 'San' and 'Bushmen'
      are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others
      have positively adopted them.\n"

    body: "Such interpretations are made on the basis that the artists followed the
      same cultural tradition as the ancestral San|Bushman. The few examples of painted
      rock art at the site certainly appear to conform to the hunter-gatherer tradition
      found elsewhere in Namibia.   Following this approach, the geometric engraved
      forms may be interpreted as illustrative of so-called ‘entoptic’ phenomena:
      shapes and patterns observed when entering a trance state, though an alternative
      origin for some of the geometrics with particular line and circle motifs has
      also been suggested. This proposal suggests that they were made by ancestral
      Khoenkhoen herder people, rather than hunter-gatherers, perhaps in relation
      to initiation practices.  \n\nAttempting to date or sequence the images based
      on superimpositioning or patina is difficult – superimposition of engravings
      at the site is rare and a range of patination colours seem to indicate these
      works having been created over a wide timescale, though it has been noted that
      a certain style of spoor images sometimes overlie some of the animal figures,
      indicating that this is a younger tradition.  Archaeological fieldwork around
      the site undertaken in 1968 by Erich Wendt recovered evidence of occupation
      including stone tools, worked ostrich eggshell and stone structures.  The dates
      recovered from radiocarbon dating ranged widely from c.5,850-180 BP (years before
      present).  The relationship between periods of occupation/site use and the production
      of rock art is not known, but based on archaeological evidence from around the
      wider area it is thought that engravings in the styles found at Twyfelfontein
      range from around 6,000 to around 1,000 years old, though some may be more recent.\n"
