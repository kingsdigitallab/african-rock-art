    body: |-
      Oukaïmeden is an alpine-like valley set 2,630 metres above sea level at the core of Morocco’s High Atlas. Records from the 16th century onwards refer to its seasonal profit as summer pasturage by herders coming from villages settled at mid-altitude. It is a well-known place due to the existence of a ski resort, and a well-frequented tourist destination for people coming from Marrakech during the summer. It is also home to one of the most impressive collections of rock art engravings in Morocco, with about 250 rock art sites and one thousand depictions scattered throughout the valley.
      Oukaïmeden rock art has been thoroughly studied by Malhome (1959, 1961) and Rodrigue (1999), and along with the Yagour plateau and Jbel Rat constitute the core of High Atlas rock art.

    body: High Atlas rock art is remarkably different not only from the rest of Moroccan
      rock art, but also from most other depictions documented throughout the Sahara.
      Although some of the engravings correspond to cattle depictions similar to those
      of nearby regions, there are other images known only in this region. One particular
      type comprises detailed, large human figures represented frontally, surrounded
      by weapons and other symbols. Another common kind of depiction is circular shapes
      with inner designs, which most probably represent shields. Weapons are also
      very common, usually depicted in isolation, but not held by warriors as is common
      in most of the North African images. Together with these themes, Oukaïmeden
      is characterised by a significant number of elephant representations (something
      surprising considering its altitude!) and a huge number of complex, geometric
      symbols whose interpretation remains obscure.

    body: Chronologically speaking, it seems Oukaïmeden engravings started to appear
      during the mid-3rd millennium BC, when the Sahara desert became increasingly
      drier and summer grazing became more and more important. The earliest depictions
      consisted mainly of animals, especially cattle, which was the species that benefited
      the most from green pastures. As time passed, pressure on this resource grew
      and tensions arose among the communities that used the valley. From the 2nd
      millennium BC onwards, animal depictions were replaced by images of weapons
      and warriors, showing a different, more violent way of reclaiming rights over
      pastures. That situation continued during the long Libyan-Berber period that
      started around the mid-1st millennium BC and lasted until the Muslim conquest
      of the area, around the 7th century AD. The arrival of Islam does not imply
      the immediate disappearance of rock art engravings, but their number decreased
      significantly and they progressively lost their significance, becoming incidental
      in Oukaïmeden history.

      the whole year: the heavy snow that falls during the winter prevented occupation
      during the winter season. But that same snow made the valley a strategic resource
      for the villages placed in the surrounding, lower areas. During summer, when
      pastures became drier in the area around Marrakech, herders would take their
      sheep and cattle to Oukaïmeden for grazing, much in the way as it is still done
      today.'

    body: |-
      Although Oukaïmeden rock art is distributed throughout the valley, there are some sites with scenes that stand above the rest due to their complexity and significance. One of them is the so-called Elephants’ Frieze, a horizontal rock face where four elephants, a feline, a rhinoceros or warthog and two human figures facing the animals were depicted. Two later, vertical Libyan-Berber inscriptions were added to the panel. The scene is placed near a shelter, facing a stream which constitutes one of the main access routes to the valley grazing areas.

      The relevance of Oukaïmeden rock art is renowned, and the whole area has been protected since 1951 by the Moroccan government, while the National Centre of Rock Art Heritage in Marrakech has carried on several research projects in the area. However, the interest in the site doesn’t mean its preservation is assured: the growing incidence of tourism, the extraction of stones for building purposes in nearby Marrakech and vandalism are threats that have still to be dealt with. The fragile environment of Oukaïmeden valley adds an extra concern about the preservation of one of the most complete and better-preserved rock sites in Morocco.
