    body: 'The Matobo Hills (also spelled as Matopo or Matopos Hills) are located
      to the south-west of Zimbabwe, in Matabeleland, one of the two main rock art
      regions in the country. It is a large region, more than 2000 sq. km, characterized
      by granite hills separated by nearly parallel valleys where the vegetation consists
      of scattered woodlands and areas covered by grass with an abundance of wild
      fruits. The region was occupied since at least the Middle Stone Age, but the
      human presence increased in the last millennia BC. The region holds an incredible
      amount of rock art; as many as 3,000 sites have been estimated based on the
      better surveyed areas. Paintings constitute the vast majority of depictions,
      although occasional engravings have also been reported. Paintings are usually
      found in rock shelters and associated with archaeological remains, which show
      an occupation of the area since the Early Stone Age. '

    body: 'The rock art of the Matobo Hills is as varied as that of the rest of Zimbabwe,
      mainly consisting of depictions of animals and human figures often grouped in
      complex scenes, clustered or represented in rows. Human figures are predominant,
      with males being more numerous than women and children very rare. They are usually
      depicted in a slender style, facing left or right but with the upper part of
      the body facing front, and often carrying bows, arrows or other objects. Regarding
      the animals, mammals dominate, with the kudu antelope being especially numerous
      although this animal is not commonly found in the Matobo Hills. A wide range
      of animals such as smaller antelopes, giraffes, zebras, ostriches, monkeys,
      eland antelope, rhinoceros and to a lesser extent carnivores are also depicted.
      The animals are represented in very different attitudes and may be depicted
      standing still, running or lying. Humans and animals are often related in hunting
      scenes. Along with animals and human figures, a fair number of geometric symbols
      are present, including a very characteristic type of motif made of a series
      of narrow oval-like shapes (formlings) usually depicted vertically, and sometimes
      interpreted as beehives. '

    body: 'One of the characteristics of the Matobo Hills rock art is the incredible
      variety of colours used, which includes a wide range of reds, purples, oranges,
      browns and yellows, as well as black, white and grey tones. Colours are often
      combined, and in some cases particular colours seem to have been chosen for
      specific animals. A common feature in some types of animals as giraffes and
      antelopes is the outline of the figure in red or white, with the body infilled
      in a different colour. '

    body: "Many of the depictions in the Matobo Hills are associated with hunter-gatherers,
      providing a great amount of information about the social, economic and spiritual
      life of these groups. Depictions of daily objects (bows, vessels, digging sticks,
      cloaks) appear depicted in the rock art, and humans are shown hunting animals,
      fighting other groups and dancing in what seem to be ritual scenes. In fact,
      many of the scenes show strong similarities to those found in the Drakensberg
      (South Africa), and part of the iconography in the Zimbabwean paintings – ‘therianthropes’
      (part-human, part-animal figures), elongated figures, rain animals, geometric
      figures – can be easily related to trance or rain-making activities similar
      to those seen in South Africa. These paintings have been interpreted as representing
      the trance experiences of shamans (the term ‘shaman’ is derived from Siberian
      concepts of Shamanism and its applicability to San|Bushman¹ cultures has been
      questioned, but it is utilised here on the understanding that it sufficiently
      represents trancers in this academic context, where it is the most frequently
      used term to describe them). However, unlike in South Africa, the Matobo Hills
      rock art is not recent and researchers lack the key ethnographic records that
      help us to interpret the paintings. Therefore, interpretations cannot be directly
      extrapolated from the South African paintings to those of the Matobo Hills,
      and researchers such as Peter Garlake have broadened the interpretative framework
      of this art to include social issues in addition to the religious. \n\n"

    body: 'Not all the paintings in the Matobo Hills can be ascribed to groups of
      hunter gatherers, though. Although fewer, there are some paintings that correspond
      to a later period which were made by Iron Age farmers. Unlike in South Africa,
      rock art does not show evidence of interaction between these two groups, and
      it is probable that the hunter-gatherers that inhabited the area were either
      displaced or absorbed by these new farmer communities. However, some of the
      later paintings show some links with the previous hunter-gatherers traditions.
      This later art consists mainly of schematic figures (usually animals, including
      domestic ones such as goats and cows) and geometric symbols, mostly depicted
      in white but also red or black and smeared with the hand or the fingers. '

    body: 'The Matobo Hills constitute a perfect example of how nature and human presence
      can become imbricated, to create a living landscape in which every hill is recognized
      individually and many of them are still venerated by the communities living
      in the area. Undoubtedly, rock art played a significant role in this process
      of progressive sacralisation of the landscape. The importance of the thousands
      of sites scattered throughout the hills is an invaluable testimony of the strong
      spirituality of hunter-gatherers that created it, and their deep relation to
      the land in which they lived. '
