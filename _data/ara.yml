    Africa's rock art is as diverse as the continent itself. In 2014 the African rock art image project team began cataloguing around 25,000 digital photographs of rock art from across Africa – originally from the Trust for African Rock Art (TARA) – through generous support from the Arcadia Fund.

    Combining a wide range of research from the British Museum, TARA and colleagues in Africa, the project is cataloguing and digitally preserving African rock art, ensuring global open access well into the future.

    On these pages, you can explore the images catalogued so far by country, and find out more through a series of themes.

      body: Between 1969 and 1972, German archaeologist, W.E. Wendt, researching in
        an area known locally as 'Goachanas', unearthed several painted slabs in a
        cave he named Apollo 11, after NASA’s successful moon landing mission. Seven
        painted stone slabs of brown-grey quartzite, depicting a variety of animals
        painted in charcoal, ochre and white, were located in a Middle Stone Age deposit.
        These images are not easily identifiable to species level, but have been interpreted
        variously as felines and/or bovids; one in particular has been observed to
        be either a zebra, giraffe or ostrich, demonstrating the ambiguous nature
        of the depictions.

      title: Art and our modern mind
      title_internal: 'General: origins, chapter 3'
      body: |-
        While the Apollo 11 plaques may be the oldest discovered representational art in Africa, this is not the beginning of the story of art. It is now well-established, through genetic and fossil evidence, that anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) developed in Africa more than 100,000 years ago; of these, a small group left the Continent around 60,000-80,000 years ago and spread throughout the rest of the world. Recently discovered examples of patterned stone, ochre and ostrich eggshell, as well as evidence of personal ornamentation emerging from Middle Stone Age Africa (100,000–60,000 years ago), have demonstrated that ‘art’ is not only a much older phenomenon than previously thought, but that it has its roots in the African continent. Africa is where we share a common humanity.

        The first examples of what we might term ‘art’ in Africa, dating from between 100,000–60,000 years ago, emerge in two very distinct forms: personal adornment in the form of perforated seashells suspended on twine, and incised and engraved stone, ochre and ostrich eggshell. Despite some sites being 8,000km and 40,000 years apart, an intriguing feature of the earliest art is that these first forays appear remarkably similar. It is worth noting here that the term ‘art’ in this context is highly problematic, in that we cannot assume that humans living 100,000 years ago, or even 10,000 years ago, had a concept of art in the same way that we do, particularly in the modern Western sense. However, it remains a useful umbrella term for our purposes here.

      title: Pattern and design
      title_internal: 'General: origins, chapter 4'
      body: |-
        The practice of engraving or incising, which emerges around 12,000 years ago in Saharan rock art, has its antecedents much earlier, up to 100,000 years ago. Incised and engraved stone, bone, ochre and ostrich eggshell have been found at sites in southern Africa. These marked objects share features in the expression of design, exhibiting patterns that have been classified as cross-hatching.

        One of the most iconic and well-publicised sites that have yielded cross-hatch incised patterning on ochre is Blombos Cave, on the southern Cape shore of South Africa. Of the more than 8,500 fragments of ochre deriving from the MSA levels, 15 fragments show evidence of engraving. Two of these, dated to 77,000 years ago, have received the most attention for the design of cross-hatch pattern.

        For many archaeologists, the incised pieces of ochre at Blombos are the most complex and best-formed evidence for early abstract representations, and are unequivocal evidence for symbolic thought and language. The debate about when we became a symbolic species and acquired fully syntactical language – what archaeologists term ‘modern human behaviour’ – is both complex and contested. It has been proposed that these cross-hatch patterns are clear evidence of thinking symbolically, because the motifs are not representational and as such are culturally constructed and arbitrary. Moreover, in order for the meaning of this motif to be conveyed to others, language is a prerequisite.

        The Blombos engravings are not isolated occurrences, since the presence of such designs occur at more than half a dozen other sites in South Africa, suggesting that this pattern is indeed important in some way, and not the result of idiosyncratic behaviour. It is worth noting, however, that for some scholars, the premise that the pattern is symbolic is not so certain. The patterns may indeed have a meaning, but it is how that meaning is associated, either by resemblance (iconic) or correlation (indexical), that is important for our understanding of human cognition.

      body: Personal ornamentation and engraved designs are the earliest evidence
        of art in Africa, and are inextricably tied up with the development of human
        cognition. For tens of thousands of years, there has been not only a capacity
        for, but a motivation to adorn and to inscribe, to make visual that which
        is important. The interesting and pertinent issue in the context of this project
        is that the rock art we are cataloguing, describing and researching comes
        from a tradition that goes far back into African prehistory. The techniques
        and subject matter resonate over the millennia.

      title: Introduction
      title_internal: 'General: chronologies, chapter 1'
      body: The axiom that rock art is notoriously difficult to date serves only to
        paint a partial picture of the inconsistent and contested chronological records
        of rock art in Africa. For example, where research has focused on interpretation,
        chronology has been less prominent and as such the capacity for judging meaningful
        relationships between sites and imagery has been inhibited; by contrast where
        chronologies have led research agendas, the temporal and spatial relationships
        are much clearer, but chronologies are hotly disputed. A significant obstacle
        is the challenge in directly dating rock art, and current research is exploring
        ways forward in refining these techniques. Here, we give an overview of dating
        methods and developed chronologies to date in rock art regions across the
        continent.

      title: Relative Dating
      title_internal: 'General: chronologies, chapter 3'
      body: |-
        Relative chronologies aim to organise the images from the oldest to the more recent, even if their exact dates are not known, providing the relative position of groups of depictions over time. It uses methods such as the analysis of superimpositions (the figures on the top have to be younger than those underneath), the study of depictions of animals already extinct or newly introduced in areas (for example, camels in the Sahara) or objects that have a known timeframe of usage, such as ships, firearms, chariots, etc.

        In some cases, graffiti can be found alongside figures, and linguistic studies can help to determine the age of both texts and depictions. Of course, one of the best ways to establish a relative date for rock art is when it is covered by archaeological deposits that can be dated through radiocarbon methods or archaeological materials. However, that date only states the minimum age of the rock art depictions, as they could have been covered hundreds or thousands of years after the images were painted or engraved. Moreover, these situations are very rare, as most of the time rock art is situated in the open air, without associated archaeological sites.

      title: Absolute Dating
      title_internal: 'General: chronologies, chapter 4'
      body: The second type of dating is called absolute dating and provides concrete
        dates (or more often, intervals of age) in which the images were made. Although
        this could seem the perfect solution for the dating of paintings, the methods
        of absolute dating can only be used in very specific contexts, and often have
        serious problems of accuracy and reliability. The most efficient is based
        on the radiocarbon (carbon-14) method, measuring the amount of carbon remaining
        in pigments, although in many depictions the remnants of paint are so sparse
        that the size of the samples is too low to be measured. Besides, this method
        is destructive, as part of the painting has to be removed from the original
        site to collect the sample.

      title: Dating engravings
      title_internal: 'General: chronologies, chapter 5'
      body: 'The study of engravings is even more difficult, as it is based on the
        changes that affect their surface after they were made. The most obvious is
        a progressive change in colour, making the older engravings seems “darker”
        than the newer. When the changes in colour are due to chemical, internal processes,
        the term used is *patina*, while when they are caused by the accumulation
        of particles the process is known as *varnishing*. Finally, the progressive
        weathering of the engraving’s traces can also be measured. By studying the
        pace of these natural processes, scientists can propose dates for the engravings.
        However, as with carbon-14, these methods have several problems that affect
        their suitability: the study of these natural processes is slow and costly,
        and the results can only be applied to small, concrete areas. There are also
        problems with the accuracy of the measurements, and risks of contamination
        of samples are high. Therefore, although they are promising, the absolute
        dating methods are still far from providing generalized and relatively easy
        ways to reliably date rock art.'

        __Stylistic dating__

        The importance of dating has been at the forefront of much research in North African rock art, yet there is no consensus of opinion about the precise dating of the phases of rock art in this region. The construction of rock art sequences has been predicated on stylistic analysis, on which most scholars agree in principle, and broadly conforms to the following:


        - *Early Hunter*, *Wild Fauna* Period or *Bubalus* Period: 12,000 – 8,000 years ago
        - *Round Head* Period: 10,000 – 8,000 years ago
        - *Pastoral* Period: 7,500 – 4,000 years ago
        - *Horse* Period: 3,000 – 2,000 years ago
        - *Camel* Period: 2,000 years ago – present

        For the most part, there is general agreement on the dating of the Horse and Camel period, but the earliest phases of rock art - the *Bubalus*/*Round Head*/*Pastoral* periods, are much more contentious. Researchers Henri Lhote and Alfredo Muzzolini have argued that the *Pastoral* period begins around 6,000 years ago, while others, such as Fabrizio Mori, propose an earlier date of 8,000 years ago. Domestic stock is thought to have existed in the Sahara from around 7,500 years ago, making a date of 8,000 years old for paintings of cattle (which may have been wild) feasible. Dating the end of this period is just as problematic, with Lhote and Mori placing it between 3,000-4,000 years ago and Muzzolini about 1,000 years later. However, the largest discrepancy relates to the *Bubalus* and *Round Head* periods, where significantly disparate chronologies have been proposed by Lhote, Mori and Muzzolini. The most extreme of these is the *Bubalus* period, where Mori advocates an Early/Long chronology proposing that the earliest images date back 12,000 years, while Muzzolini suggests a Recent/Short chronology proposing a much later emergence of art in the region at 6,000 years ago.

        The application of direct dating will be central in resolving these substantial differences and has yielded some fruitful results on archaeological sites in making meaningful correlations. However, for the time being, the chronologies of Saharan rock art remain ambiguous and contested.

        __Relative dating__

        Based on observations in the field, relative sequences were proposed by Patricia Vinnicombe (1976) for the southern region of the Drakensberg and by Revell Mason (1933) and Harald Pager (1971) for the northern region. Subsequently, several sites in South Africa have been analysed using a method termed the Harris Matrix. In its original context the Harris Matrix was a diagrammatic tool used in archaeological fieldwork to determine the temporal succession of deposits and stratigraphic relationships. Its use in South African rock art has been limited and often on isolated sites, and one of the drawbacks in this methodology is the lack of information on time lapses between successive images. While a few radiocarbon and Accelerator Mass Spectometry (AMS) dates have been secured for some sites, the absolute dates need to be matched with relative chronologies, which to date are still not firmly established.

        __Stylistic dating__

        Much rock art research has focused on the San rock paintings found in southern Africa (Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe). The subject matter of San rock art is extremely varied but regional characteristics can be seen; for example, depictions of eland dominate much of the rock art in South Africa, while kudu and elephants prevail in Zimbabwe. The earliest San art is thought to be up to 10,000 years old and continues possibly well into the twentieth century in the Drakensberg mountains.

        The spread of farming to South Africa by Bantu-language speakers around 3,500 years ago brought another style of rock art, until it ceased around the mid-1900s. The art is predominantly in white, and applied using fingers, which gives it a rough appearance. Subject matter is varied but dominated by humans and animals. Later rock art reflected contact with European settlers/colonisers, attested to by the numerous depictions of steam trains, soldiers, settlers and guns.

        __Absolute/Relative dating__

        Little research has been conducted, either on absolute or relative rock art chronologies in central Africa, and is therefore still poorly understood by comparison with northern and southern Africa. Promising recent radiocarbon dates have been reported from paintings in Angola, but the absence of contextual information with these dates renders them unproductive. Dating rock art by association with archaeological deposits has not proved entirely successful either. Relative chronologies have been suggested, and while there are regional variations, in general two styles of rock art have been identified and associated with a relative chronology: Twa and Sandawe.

        __Stylistic dating__

        Twa-style art dates to around 3,000 to 1,000 years ago and was made by hunter-gatherer groups in eastern and central Africa. Depictions of animals are rare in Twa art and usually consist of geometric designs, often concentric circles. Ancestral Sandawe art, found mainly in central Tanzania, is thought to date from around 9,000 years ago to the recent past, and includes fairly large naturalistic images of animals in both hunting and domestic scenes. Figures are frequently holding bows and arrows, and are often depicted with elaborate hairstyles and/or headdresses.

        observations into the methodologies by which images are created. Technically
        speaking, images can be broadly classified into two main groups: petroglyphs

      title_internal: 'General: how made, chapter 2'
      body: The pigments used in paintings are dependent on local resources, but typically
        have been made of minerals such as ochre that comes in a variety of red, brown
        and yellow hues. White is derived from silica, china clay and gypsum and black
        is obtained from manganese minerals, charcoal or specularite. Once collected
        these minerals were ground to form a powder and mixed with liquids such as
        egg albumen, urine, blood, saliva or water to make the pigment easier to apply
        and to act as a binding agent. Current research is exploring new methods to
        be able to date these ingredients. A variety of tools have been used to apply
        the pigment onto rock surfaces including birds’ feathers, animal hair, grasses
        or reeds and fingers. This process is not simply a technological one, and
        for many cultural groups the pigment itself and the method of application
        are imbued with symbolic meaning.

      body: A very specific type of image is the handprint. These can be made in two
        ways, positively and negatively; by covering the hand in paint and applying
        it to the rock surface or by placing the hand on the rock and blowing paint
        through a tube or from the mouth over the hand to produce a stencil effect.
        Most images were made just in one colour, although examples of bichrome or
        polychrome are relatively frequent. Again, although very rare, there are some
        examples of figures combining engraving and painting.

      title: Petroglyphs – Engraving
      title_internal: 'General: how made, chapter 4'
      body: Three techniques were generally used to remove the rock surface; incising/engraving
        (lines are cut into the rock with a sharp tool); pecking (hammering and chipping
        away at the rock surface) and scraping. Rock faces were sometimes ‘prepared’
        by scraping, allowing for an improved surface on which to inscribe the image.
        Incising or engraving involves scratching into the stone surface using a sharp
        lithic flake or metal blade. Pecking is a form of indirect percussion whereby
        a second rock is used like a chisel between the hammerstone and the rock face,
        while scraping is created using a hard hammerstone, which is battered against
        the rock surface. A last, much rarer method of engraving is the bas-relief
        technique, where the area around the image is lowered (usually by polishing)
        thus making the figure raise over the surface.

      body: These methods of engraving are sometimes combined, as happens in the Sahara
        where the outline of pecked figures is polished afterwards. Although for the
        most part the engravings just depict the figures’ contour, on other occasions
        all or part of the image is infilled with pecking or polishing. In all these
        techniques, after differing periods of time the engraved surfaces weather
        and acquire the same darker patina as the original surface.

          These skilfully engraved images depict long-horned cattle with their heads bowed. Thought to date between 7,000 and 8,000 years ago, today these images stand alone in a vast wilderness of sand and rock. However, this environment was once wetter and more fertile, and this site may have been close to a local watering hole where animals regularly drank and bathed. Indeed, even today during the rains, the depression in the sand at the base of the inselberg fills up with water, which gives the appearance that the cows are bending their heads to drink.

          These engravings are incorporated in a local myth that tells of a shepherd who engraved the crying cows after travelling night and day with his herd to a spring he thought would quench their thirst. Finding it dry, he captured in stone his cattle’s grief as he watched them die one by one. Climatic data has shown a number of significant cooling events in the North Atlantic, one of which – dating to around eight thousand years ago – resulted in a period of aridity lasting a number of centuries across the Sahara, and may coincide with these engravings and of the associated myth.

        title_internal: 'Algeria: featured site, chapter 3'
        body: In artistic terms, the execution of this panel of engraved cows is extremely
          accomplished and testifies to someone who was not only a skilful carver
          but who we might even regard as a sculptor in the modern sense, who understood
          both materials and the interplay of light and shade in the reductive process
          of carving. But even more than this, the artist understood the environmental
          conditions in which he was working. It has been observed that the depth
          and thickness of the engraved lines has been carefully calculated to ensure
          that as the sun travels across them during the day, they appear to move.
          This sense of movement is made most acute as the evening shadows, falling
          into each groove, give the cattle a sense of mass and movement. Other artistic
          devices, such as double lines with recessed areas and internal polishing,
          evoke a perception of depth and density. The interplay of light and shade
          is consummately adept and dynamic, and the sculptural quality of the image
          sensorially evocative. This is the work of a practised craftsman, who demonstrates
          a deep of understanding of materials, techniques and the natural environment.

        body: Algeria is Africa’s largest country geographically and has long been
          noted for its rich concentrations of rock art, particularly in the Tassili
          n’Ajjer, inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. More than 15,000
          paintings and engravings, some of which date back up to 12,000 years, provide
          unique insights into the environmental, social, cultural and economic changes
          in the country across a period of 10,000 or more years. The area is particularly
          famous for its Round Head paintings, first described and published in the
          1930s by French archaeologist Henry Lhote.

        title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 2'
        body: Algeria is situated in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered
          on the west by Morocco and on the east by Tunisia and Libya, with a long
          Mediterranean coastline to the north. The Atlas Mountains cross Algeria
          east to west along the Mediterranean coast. The northern portion of the
          country is an area of mountains, valleys, and plateaus, but more than 80%
          of the country falls within the Sahara Desert. Rock art is located in the
          Algerian Maghreb and the Hoggar Mountains but the richest zone of rock art
          is located in the mountain range of Tassili n'Ajjer, a vast plateau in the
          south-east of the country. Water and sand erosion have carved out a landscape
          of thin passageways, large arches, and high-pillared rocks, described by
          Lhote as 'forests of stone'.

        body: |-
          Rock art in Algeria, notably the engravings in South Oran, has been the subject of European study since 1863. Notable surveys were made by A. Pomel (1893-1898), Stéphane Gsell (1901-1927), G. B. M. Flamand (1892-1921), Leo Frobenius and Hugo Obermaier (1925), Henri Breuil (1931-1957), L. Joleaud (1918-1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (1935-1955). Henri Lhote visited the area in 1955 and 1964, completing previous research and adding new descriptions included in a major publication on the area in 1970.

          The rock art of the Tassili region was introduced to Western eyes as a result of visits and sketches made by French legionnaires, in particular a Lt. Brenans during the 1930s. On several of his expeditions, Lt. Brenans took French archaeologist Henri Lhote who went on to revisit sites in Algeria between 1956-1970 documenting and recording the images he found. Regrettably, some previous methods of recording and/or documenting have caused damage to the vibrancy and integrity of the images.

        body: The earliest pieces of rock art are engraved images reflecting a past
          vibrant fertile environment teeming with life and includes elephant, rhinoceros,
          hippopotamus and fish as well as numerous predators, giraffe, and plains
          animals such as antelope and gazelle. When human figures are depicted in
          this period they are very small in stature and hold throwing sticks or axes.
          More than simply hunting scenes, they are likely to reflect people’s own
          place within their environment and their relationship with it.

        title: Round Head Period
        title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 5'
        body: The area is especially famous for its Round Head paintings. Thought
          to be up to 9,000 years old, some of these paintings are the largest found
          on the African continent, measuring up to 13 feet in height. The Round Head
          period comprises depictions of figures with round, featureless heads and
          formless bodies, often appearing to be ‘floating’. Some features or characteristics
          of Round Head paintings found on the Tassili plateau are unique to the area,
          and the depiction of certain motifs may have held special significance locally,
          making particular sites where they occur the locus of rites, ritual or ceremonial
          activity. The majority of animal depictions are mouflon (wild mountain sheep)
          and antelope, but they are represented only in static positions and not
          as part of a hunting scene.

        body: The subsequent Pastoral Period, from around 7,500-4,000 years ago, portrays
          a very different world to the preceding ethereal Round Head period and coincides
          with the transition from a temperate Sahara towards aridification. Images
          are stylistically varied, which may attest to the movement of different
          cultural groups. Depictions now include domesticated animals such as cattle,
          sheep, goats and dogs; scenes portray herders, men hunting with bows, and
          representations of camp life with women and children – in essence, scenes
          that reference more settled communities.

          Desertification across the Sahara required new methods of traversing and utilising the landscape; depictions of horses (often with riders) and of chariots indicate this change. Horse-drawn chariots are often depicted at a ‘flying’ gallop and are likely to have been used for hunting rather than warfare.

          Libyan-Berber script, used by ancestral Berber peoples, started to appear in association with images. However, the meaning of this juxtaposition of text and image remains an enigma, as it is indecipherable to modern day Tuareg.

        body: 'Tchitundu-Hulu is the generic name for a group of four rock art sites
          located in the Namibe province on the south-west corner of Angola, by the
          edge of the Namib desert, about 120 km from the sea.  It is a semi-arid
          plain characterized by the presence of several inselbergs (isolated hills
          rising from the plain), the most important of which is Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume.  The
          group of rock art sites are surrounded by several seasonal rivers, within
          a maximum distance of 1 km.  Tchitundu-Hulu was first documented by José
          Camarate Andrade França in 1953, and since then it has become one of the
          most studied rock art sites in Angola, attracting the interest of renowned
          researchers such as  Abbé Breuil, J.  Desmond Clark and Santos Junior.  In
          2014 one of the sites was the subject of a Masters dissertation (Caema 2014),
          the latest addition to the long term research on the site.  '

          the hill of the souls or the sacred hill- while Mulume and Mucai are translated

          Mulume, although some black figures are present, too.  Paintings often combine
          two, three or even more colours, and consist mainly of geometric signs,

          what seem hunting scenes.  The other two sites (the Rock of the Zebras and
          the Rock of the Pond) consist of engravings similar to those of Tchitundu-Hulu

        body: 'The chronology of the Tchitundu-Hulu rock art is difficult to establish,
          and it is unclear if the four sites are of the same period at all.  Theories
          based on the lithic tools dispersed throughout the area ascribed the paintings
          to an ancient time period, possibly  tens of thousands of years old.  Radiocarbon
          samples coming from the excavation of Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume showed a date
          in the early 1st millennium BC, although the relation of the archaeological
          remains and the paintings has not been proved and archaeological materials
          of a more modern period were also located.  A sample taken from the pigments
          at the site rendered a date of the beginning of the first centuries of the
          1st millennium AD.  In any case, Tchitundu-Hulu hosts some of the oldest
          examples of rock art in the country, and it has been linked to the schematic
          traditions that characterize the rock art of Central Africa, more abundant
          in central Mozambique and Malawi.  '

        body: The question of who made the engravings or paintings is another complex
          issue for the interpretation of the Tchitundu-Hulu depictions.  The harsh
          conditions of this semi-desert area probably favoured a seasonal occupation
          of the region during the rainy season.  The location of Tchitundu-Hulu at
          the edge of the desert could also have made this place a strategic site
          for the communities living in the region.  Several local groups - Kwisi,
          Kuvale - have traditionally inhabited the area, but the authorship of these
          engravings and paintings and the motives for creating them remains obscure,
          as does the purpose and cultural context of the complex images of Tchitundu-Hulu.

          from the Atlantic Ocean to the centre of the continent.  Angolan rock art
          consists both of  engravings and paintings, and is mostly located relatively
          near to the coast, although some sites have also been documented in the
          easternmost part of the country, near the border with Zambia.  Depictions
          are very varied, representing animals, human figures and geometric signs,
          in many cases grouped in hunting or war scenes.  In some cases, firearms
          appear represented, showing the period of contact with Europeans from the
          1500s onwards.  '

        title: Geography and rock art distribution
        title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 2'
        body: Angola has a variety of climates.  The flat coastal plain ranges between
          25 and 150 km in width, and is a semiarid region covered by scrub, turning
          into sand dunes to the south, near Namibia.  The coastal region abruptly
          gives way to a series of mountains and escarpments divided  by the Cuanza
          River.  The northern part has an average height of 500 m, but the southern
          region is far higher, with the peaks occasionally exceeding 2,300 m.  This
          mountainous region is in fact a transitional area between the coastal plain
          and the great central plateau of Africa.  This plateau dominates Angola’s
          geography with an altitude from 1,200 to 1,800 m, and consists of a region
          of plains and low hills with a tropical climate.  The climate becomes drier
          to the south and wetter to the north, where a wide region of the country
          can be defined as rainforest.

          north to south, with a clear concentration in its central area.  However
          some rock art sites have also been discovered in the interior of the country,
          especially in its east-central region, and therefore this concentration
          in the coast could be explained by different research priorities in the
          past. Although both paintings and engravings are present in Angolan rock
          art, the latter seem to be predominant near the coast, while paintings are
          more common in the interior and to the south.  '

          1500s and 1600s  which could correspond to rock art paintings, the first
          clear mention of a rock art site was made in 1816 with research only starting
          in 1939, when José Redinha published the first news about engravings of
          Angola.  Since then, research was intermittent until the 1950s, when the
          important site of Tchitundu-Hulu was studied and published.  The relevance
          of Tchitundu-Hulu attracted the attention of important scholars such as
          Desmond Clark and the  Abbé Breuil, who along with Portuguese researchers
          contextualized Angolan rock art within the continent.  Research increased
          significantly over the next two decades, but during the 1980s political
          instability gave way to a period of stagnation until the 1990s, when new
          researchers began comprehensive surveys and organised the available rock
          art information.  '

        title: 'Themes '
        title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 5'
        body: 'The rock art in Angola has a wide variety of styles and themes, depending
          on the region and the chronology.  The oldest images are painted or engraved
          geometric symbols and anthropomorphic figures.  More recent depictions include
          axes, spears and firearms.  The latest period of the Angolan rock art includes
          complex scenes of war and hunting, and in a number of cases human figures
          carried on a palanquin-like structure.  Although schematic figures are widespread
          throughout the country, they are predominant in the south-west where most
          of the sites have been compared to those in the Central Africa Schematic
          Art zone, with parallels in Malawi and Mozambique.  In the west-central
          area of Angola, in addition to the schematic symbols and animals, images
          of men holding weapons, fighting and hunting are common, including warriors
          holding firearms which make reference to the first contact with Europeans
          by the 16th century.  Near the north-west coast, some of the paintings and
          engravings have been related to objects used in religious ceremonies –wooden
          statuettes or decorated pot lids.  In particular, a close association has
          been establish between rock art depictions and the so-called Cabinda pot
          lids, which have different carved symbols—animals, objects, human figures—acting
          as a shared visual language.  '

        title: " Chronology"
        title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 6'
        body: 'As is so often the case with rock art, the dating of images is complex
          due to the absence of direct correlations between rock art depictions and
          well contextualised archaeological remains.  Some of the sites with rock
          art have been excavated showing dates of the 7th millennium BC, but the
          relationship with the rock art is unclear.  In the Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume
          site, the excavation at the cave provided a 1st millennium BC date, and
          the only radiocarbon date taken from the pigments at this site provided
          a date of the 1st century AD, which corresponds with other dates of the
          same style in Central Africa.  The second tool for assigning a chronology
          is the analysis of the subject matter represented in the rock art depictions:
          the presence of metal objects, for example, would imply a date of the 1st
          millennium AD onwards, when this material was introduced.  Whereas, depictions
          featuring images of firearms would date from the 16th century onwards.  The
          end of the rock art tradition has been associated with the presence of Europeans
          but was probably progressive as the control of the region by the Portuguese
          grew during the 17th and 18th centuries.  '

        body: The Ennedi Plateau is a mountainous region in the north-eastern corner
          of Chad, an impressive sandstone massif eroded by wind and temperature changes
          into series of terraces, gorges, cliffs and outliers. Although it is part
          of the Sahara, the climate of the Ennedi Plateau is much more suitable for
          human habitation than most of the desert, with regular rain during summer,
          wadis (seasonal rivers) flowing once or twice a year, and a relatively large
          range of flora and fauna – including some of the few remaining populations
          of Saharan crocodiles west of the Nile. Throughout the caves, canyons and
          shelters of the Ennedi Plateau, thousands of images – dating from 5000 BC
          onwards – have been painted and engraved, comprising one of the biggest
          collections of rock art in the Sahara and characterised by a huge variety
          of styles and themes.

        body: 'Within this kaleidoscope, a series of engravings have become especially
          renowned for their singularity and quality: several groups of life-sized
          human figures depicted following very regular stylistic conventions. They
          were first reported internationally in the early 1950s; during the following
          decades more sites were discovered, almost all of them around Wadi Guirchi,
          and especially near a site known as Niola Doa. To date, six sites have been
          documented, totalling about 40 depictions. Most of the figures were engraved
          on big, vertical boulders, in groups, although occasionally they appear
          isolated. They follow a very regular pattern: most of them are life-sized
          or even bigger and are represented upright facing right or left, with one
          arm bent upwards holding a stick resting over the neck or shoulder and the
          other arm stretched downwards. In some cases, the figures have an unidentified,
          horizontal object placed at the neck, probably an ornament. Interspersed
          among the bigger figures, there are smaller versions which are slightly
          different, some of them with the arms in the same position as the others
          but without sticks, and some facing forwards with hands on hips. In general,
          figures seem to be naked, although in some cases the smaller figures are
          depicted with skirts.'

          buttocks and thighs, which have been interpreted as steatopygia (a genetic
          condition resulting in an accumulation of fat in and around the buttocks).
          Although the best documented examples of steatopygia (both in rock art and
          contemporary groups) correspond to southern Africa, steatopygic depictions
          occur elsewhere in North African rock art, with examples in other parts
          of the Ennedi Plateau, but also in Egypt and Sudan, where they occasionally
          appear incised in pottery.

          In addition, almost all the figures are decorated with intricate geometric patterns (straight and wavy lines, squares, meanders and, in one case, schematic birds), which could be interpreted as garments, tattoos, scarifications or body paintings. In some cases, figures appear simply outlined, but these very rare cases were probably left unfinished. The decorative patterns extend to the ears, which are always depicted with geometric designs, and to the head, where these designs could correspond to hairstyles.

          The decorative richness of the Niola Doa engravings has led to their interpretation as ritual scenes, probably special occasions when body decoration was part of a more complex set of activities with dancing or singing. On some occasions, comparisons have been established between the geometric designs of Niola Doa and different types of body decorations (body painting, scarifications). Scarifications, in particular, have a long tradition within some African cultures and in many cases parallels have been documented between this kind of body decoration and material culture (i.e. pottery, pipes, wood sculptures or clothes). The relative proximity of groups with well-known traditions of scarifications and body painting has led to comparisons which, although suggested, cannot be wholly proved.

        body: 'Regarding their chronology, as with most rock art depictions the Niola
          Doa figures are difficult to date, although they undoubtedly belong to the
          older periods of Chadian rock art. Some parallels have been made with the
          Round Head-style figures of the Tassili n’Ajjer (Simonis et al 1994). However,
          the Round Head figures of Algeria have a very old chronology (up to 9000
          years ago), while the rock art at the Ennedi Plateau is assumed to be much
          newer, up to the 5th or 4th millennium BC. These engravings could, therefore,
          correspond to what has been called the Archaic Period in this area, although
          a Pastoral Period chronology has also been proposed. In several other sites
          around the Ennedi Plateau, similar images have been painted, although whether
          these images are contemporary with those of Niola Doa or correspond to a
          different period is unclear. Regardless of their chronology, what is undeniable
          is the major impact these depictions had on later generations of people
          living in the area: even now, the engravings at one of the sites are known
          as the ‘Dancing Maidens’, while the name of Niola Doa means ‘The place of
          the girls’ in the local language.'

          boasts thousands of rock engravings and paintings located in two main areas:
          the Ennedi Plateau and the Tibesti Mountains, both to the north. The depictions
          – the oldest of which date back to the fifth millennium BC – represent wild
          animals, cattle and human figures. Paintings of highly detailed riders on
          camels and horses are especially numerous, as are groups of people around
          huts. Chadian rock art is particularly well known for its variety of local
          styles, and it includes some of the richest examples of Saharan rock art.'

        body: 'The north-south orientation of Chad''s elongated shape means it is
          divided into several different climatic zones: the northern part belongs
          to the Sahara Desert, while the central area is included in the Sahel border
          (the semi-arid region south of the Sahara). The southern third of the country
          is characterized by a more fertile savannah. The Ennedi Plateau and Tibesti
          mountains contain thousands of pieces of rock art, including some of the
          most famous examples in the Sahara. The Ennedi Plateau is located at the
          north-eastern corner of Chad, on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.
          It is a sandstone massif carved by erosion in a series of superimposed terraces,
          alternating plains and ragged cliffs crossed by wadis (seasonal rivers).
          Unlike other areas in the Sahara with rock art engravings or paintings,
          the Ennedi Plateau receives rain regularly – if sparsely – during the summer,
          making it a more benign environment for human life than other areas with
          significant rock art to the north, such as the Messak plateau or the Tassili
          Mountains in Libya and Algeria.'

          Different areas of Chad have been subject to varying trajectories of research. In the Tibesti Mountains, rock art was known to Europeans as early as 1869, although it was between the 1910s and 1930s that the first studies started to be carried out, by François D’Alverny. However, the main boost in research came in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to the work of Paul Huard. Over the last 50 years, researchers have found thousands of depictions throughout the region, most of them engravings, although paintings are also well represented.

          In the case of the Ennedi Plateau, its isolated position far from the main trade routes made its rock art unknown outside the area until the 1930s. During this decade, Burthe d’Annelet brought attention to the art, and De Saint-Floris published the first paper on the subject. The main effort to document this rock art came in 1956-1957, when Gerard Bailloud recorded more than 500 sites in only a sixth of the plateau's entire area.

        title: Themes
        title_internal: 'Chad: country, chapter 5'
        body: As in the rest of the Sahara, the main themes in Chadian rock art are
          directly linked to the chronology. The oldest depictions are of wild animals,
          but most common are later scenes with cattle, huts and people. As in other
          areas of the Sahara, the most recent depictions correspond to battle scenes
          of riders on horses and camels. Along with these main subjects, both areas
          have examples of very detailed scenes of daily life and human activities,
          including people playing music, visiting the sick or dancing. The rock art
          of both the Ennedi Plateau and the Tibesti regions is characterized by the
          existence of a variety of local styles, such as the so-called ‘Flying Gallop
          style’, sometimes simultaneous, sometimes successive. This variability means
          an enormous richness of techniques, themes and artistic conventions, with
          some of the most original styles in Saharan rock art.

        body: |-
          The oldest engravings in Chad are more recent than those to the north, having started to appear in the 5th to 4th millennia BC, and can be broadly divided into three main periods:

          The oldest is the so-called Archaic Period, characterized by wild animals in the Ennedi Plateau and Round Head-style figures in the Tibesti Mountains, similar to those found in the Central Sahara. The second phase is named the Bovine or Pastoral Period, when domestic cattle are the predominant animals, and a third, late period named the Dromedary or Camel Period. Unlike other areas in the Sahara, horse and camel depictions appear to be from roughly the same period (although horses were introduced to the Sahara first), so they are included in a generic Camel Period. The end of the rock art tradition in both areas is difficult to establish, but it seems to have lasted at least until the seventeenth century in the Ennedi Plateau, much longer than in other areas of the Sahara.

        body: The ‘Cave of Swimmers’ is the larger of two shallow caves situated side
          by side in the southern part of the Gilf Kebir plateau in Egypt’s Western
          Desert, an area so remote and inaccessible that its existence only became
          known to European cartographers in 1926. It is so named due to the human
          figures painted on its walls with their limbs contorted as if swimming.
          It has since become world-renowned, particularly as a key location in the
          feature film *The English Patient* (1996), based on Michael Ondaatje’s novel
          of the same name.

        body: The book and film feature fictionalised versions of the cave and its
          real-life discoverer, László Almásy, as the title character. In reality,
          Almásy was a charismatic figure in pre-war Saharan exploration. He argued
          that the ‘swimming’ figures suggested the prior existence of abundant water
          in the area and was therefore evidence that it had not always been arid
          desert, a radical new theory at the time that has since been confirmed,
          although not on the basis of these paintings as evidence. Rock art is notoriously
          difficult to date as it was a tradition practiced for thousands of years.
          These paintings have been dated at between 9,000 and 6,000 years ago, although
          some researchers have suggested both earlier and later dates.

          on the rock faces in the form of graffiti, and in the surrounding sand,
          where the tracks from previous parties (including Almásy’s) lie undisturbed,
          adding to the sense of history: not only of those who produced the paintings,

        title: Introduction
        title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 1'
        body: The rock art of Egypt was largely unknown outside of the region until
          the beginning of the 20th century. The rock paintings and engravings of
          Egypt feature a range of subjects and styles, including domestic cattle,
          wild animals, humans, boat images and inscriptions. Much of the rock art
          appears to date from within the last 8,000 years. However, earlier Palaeolithic
          engravings have also been found near the Nile, suggesting a longer time
          frame for the practice. The majority of Egypt’s most famous rock art, including
          the ‘Cave of Swimmers’, is found in the desert in the far south-west of
          the country.

          the river Nile, flows from the highlands of Ethiopia and Central Africa
          into the Mediterranean, dividing the eastern portion of the Sahara into
          the Western and Eastern Deserts, with the Sinai Peninsula to the east.

        body: |-
          The presence of rock art in Egypt has been noticed by European scholars since the early 19th century. Geographically isolated from the bulk of rock art in the country, the paintings and engravings of Gilf Kebir and Jebel Uweinat were first catalogued in the 1920s by the Egyptian explorers and public figures Hassanein Bey and Prince Kemal el Dine, and thereafter by renowned early twentieth century explorers and ethnographers such as László Almásy, Leo Frobenius, Ralph Bagnold and Abbé Breuil, whose expeditions helped bring Saharan rock art into wider public consciousness.

          Hans Winkler’s seminal *Rock Drawings of Southern Upper Egypt* (1938-9) was one of the first regional catalogues and remains a pre-eminent review of finds. Further cataloguing of rock art images and sites in the southern Nile valley took place at the time of the construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s. Where rock art historically was part of larger archaeological research in the area, in recent years it has been subject to more direct and rigorous study which will contribute to a better understanding of chronologies and relationships.

        title: Themes
        title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 4'
        body: In desert areas, recognisably stylised Pharaonic-period inscriptions
          and engravings from between 3,100 and 30 BC can be found on rock faces,
          particularly at oases and quarry sites such as Kharga Oasis and Wadi Hammamat
          in the Western and Eastern deserts. There is also rock art from later periods
          like that at Matna el-Barqa in the Western Desert hinterland, where both
          Pharaonic and later Coptic inscriptions mix with images of gods and horsemen.
          Earlier examples of engraved rock art may be found in the Nile valley, in
          what is now southern Egypt and northern Sudan, linked to progenitors of
          ancient Egyptian cultures, most particularly the people of the Naqada Periods
          (4,000-3,100 BC). This art is characterised by frequent depictions on pottery
          of river boats, which occur in much of the rock art near the Nile, and include,
          pecked on a boulder at Nag el-Hamdulab near Aswan, what is considered the
          first known depiction of a Pharaoh, on just such a boat. Also prevalent
          in these areas are numerous engravings of animals and human figures.

          cultures. Recently, the rock art at Qurta, south of Edfu, of naturalistic
          outline engravings of ancient aurochs (ancestors of domestic cattle), were
          dated reliably to the Palaeolithic Period, between 16,000 and 15,000 years
          ago, making them the oldest known rock art in northern Africa. Between the
          eighth and fourth millennia BC, Egypt’s climate was generally temperate,
          interrupted only briefly by dry spells, until the increasing aridity thereafter
          concentrated life in the Eastern Sahara around the river’s banks.

        title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 8'
        body: Some of Egypt’s most striking and famous rock art is found far from
          the Nile at Gilf Kebir, a vast sandstone plateau in the desert near the
          Libyan border. As elsewhere in the Sahara, there are frequent depictions
          of domestic cattle, people and wild animals. Like most rock art, the paintings
          and engravings here are hard to date accurately but may refer to the ‘Bovidian
          Period’ (Pastoral Period) rock art of the wider Sahara, typified by paintings
          and engravings of cattle and people (Huyge, 2009). However, the scholarly
          community recognises the inherent difficulty of formulating conclusions
          of direct links with wider rock art practices. Some evidence of pastoralists
          in the area means that this rock art could have been made as early as the
          fifth millennium BC and are thus possibly contemporaneous with Predynastic
          Egyptian cultures, but not necessarily connected (Riemer, 2013).

          a particular cosmology is better known, it can be speculated, such as the
          Nile boat paintings have been suggested to evoke funerary beliefs and practices.
          If nothing else, the cattle paintings of Gilf Kebir demonstrate the importance
          of cattle in the pastoralist culture that produced them. Despite still being
          relatively little known, the ‘mystique’ behind rock art has cultivated popular
          curiosity, in particular in Gilf Kebir’s famous ‘Cave of Swimmers’. This
          is a shallow rock shelter featuring many painted human figures in strange
          contortions, as if swimming – images which have captured the popular imagination,
          with their glimpse of life in Egypt millennia before the Pharaohs and their
          hints at a watery Sahara.

        body: Running from the Red Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, the Sahara is by far
          the world's largest hot desert. It covers over 3,500,000 square miles (9,000,000
          sq. km), a tenth of the whole African Continent. Yet we know it was not
          always so. Archaeological and geological research has shown that the Sahara
          has undergone major climatic changes since the end of the last Ice Age (c.
          10,000 BC). During this period, rain was far more abundant, and vast areas
          of the current desert were a savannah. By around 4,200 BC, changes in the
          rainfall and seasonal patterns led to a gradual desertification of the Sahara
          into an arid expanse. The analysis of archaeological sites, animal bones
          and preserved vegetal remains tell us of a greener world, where some of
          the earliest attempts at domestication of animals and rudimentary farming
          took place.

          Little is known about the people who lived in the Sahara thousands of years ago; however, through rock art, we can discern who they may have been and what images were important to them. Throughout the desert, rock art engravings and paintings depict an earlier story of the Sahara: the wild animals that lived there; the cattle herds that provided food and labour; their daily activities and beliefs are all displayed in caves and cliffs, valleys or plateaus.

          The Messak Settafet is one of these places. Situated in the Sahara, it is a large plateau running southwest to northeast through the Libyan province of Fezzan, near the borders of Algeria and Niger. Both plateaus are crossed by numerous wadis (dry riverbeds) that run to the east, flanked by cliffs filled with tens of thousands of rock art depictions, including some of the oldest engravings in the Sahara. Rich with depictions of the savannah, the rock art shows buffaloes, crocodiles, ostriches or hippopotami, all of which tells us of a wetter Sahara thousands of years ago.

          It is difficult to determine the motives of the people that created these images. There are many theories about why these people created rock art, what exactly is depicted and what the images meant to that group. One area of particular research interest is the depiction of mythical beings, therianthropic figures (part human part animal) and anthropomorphic animals (the personification of animals in human forms). Were these religious images? Cultural folklore? Or simply images pleasing to a group or culture?

        body: The technical quality of the engravings is exceptional, with deeply
          outlined and carefully polished bodies and carved cupules within their heads
          to depict eyes. Claws were also marked, maybe to reinforce the idea of fighting.
          The specific type of animal depicted is subject to debate among scholars.
          Some have described them as monkeys or mythological blends of monkeys and
          men. Their pointed ears could also identify them as cat-like figures, although
          most probably they were the representation of mythical beings, considering
          their prominence above all other figures in this area. A polished line comes
          out from the waist of both figures to join four small ostriches, depicted
          between them, which often accompany rock art in this region.

          could have a fertility-related meaning. The difference in style and technique
          may point to the woman as a later addition to the panel, taking advantage

          Another example of fighting cats has been found nearby, although it is neither so carefully made nor in such a prominent place. The similarity is, however, astonishing, and we may wonder if this second pair of beings could be a copy of the first pair, thus reflecting its symbolic importance in the people’s collective imagination.

          As is often the case with rock art, the interpretation of these images remains up for discussion. Given the care taken to engrave the images, their technical quality and their dominant position in the landscape, we can gather that these images potentially had deep meaning for the people who created them thousands of years ago, and were possibly meant to be a symbolic as well as a physical landmark for travellers and local people alike. Although the original purpose and meaning have long since been lost, the expressive power of the engravings still remains, allowing us to gain a small view into the world of the people that lived in the Sahara thousands of years ago, when it was a sprawling green savannah.

        title: Introduction
        title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 1'
        body: 'Rock art occurs in two main areas in Libya: the Tadrart Acacus and
          the Messak Plateau. The oldest works of rock art, from the Acacus Mountains,
          are engravings of mammals from the Wild Fauna Period (Early Hunter Period)
          and could be up to 12,000 years old. Thousands of paintings dating from
          up to 8,000-9,000 years ago show a diversity of imagery and include scenes
          of hunting, pastoralism, daily life, dancing and a variety of wild and domesticated
          animals. The Messak Plateau is home to tens of thousands of engravings,
          and only a few paintings have been located in this region to date. The area
          is best known for larger-than-life-size engravings of animals such as elephants,
          rhino and bubalus (a now extinct buffalo), and some of the most iconic depictions
          in Saharan rock art, such as the ‘Fighting Cats’ scene.'

        title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 2'
        body: The fourth largest country in Africa, Libya is located in the Maghreb
          region of North Africa, bordered on the west by Tunisia and Algeria, Egypt
          to the east, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. Except for the narrow
          strip along the coast, where 80% of the population resides, Libya lies entirely
          within the Sahara Desert. The main areas of rock art lie in the south-western
          corner of the country, with the Tadrart Acacus continuing into south-eastern
          Algeria, where they are simply known as the Tadrart. The Acacus in Libya
          and the Tadrart in Algeria are now listed and combined as a trans-frontier
          World Heritage Site by UNESCO, linking these two geographically divided
          sites into a cultural whole.

        title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 3'
        body: The Messak rock art has been known to Europeans since Heinrich Barth’s
          expedition in 1850, although it was not until 1932 that the engravings were
          methodically studied by Leo Frobenius. Some initial interpretative hypotheses
          about the rock art in the Acacus were formulated in the late 1930s by Italian
          archaeologist Paolo Graziosi. Subsequently, the region became the subject
          of systematic investigation by Fabrizio Mori, another Italian archaeologist,
          who also published the first scientific papers on Libyan rock art in the
          1960s. Since then, consistent surveying has continued in this region and
          stratigraphic excavations of archaeological deposits have established a
          cultural sequence dating back to the Holocene Period.

        title: Chronology and early rock art
        title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 4'
        body: |-
          Rock art chronology in North Africa is based largely on the combination of stylistic features, superimposition, subject matter and the degree of weathering or patina. While not an exact science, chronological periods are recognisable in the depictions, which generally correspond to climatic and environmental phases. Some of the oldest images are found on the Messak plateau and represent a Sahara that was significantly wetter and more fertile than today, exemplified by representations of large mammals – some of which are aquatic species – incised into the rock faces.

          The chronology of the Tadrart Acacus during the Holocene has been established more firmly through the excavation and dating of archaeological sites. Based on this evidence, these earliest images may coincide with the first Holocene occupation of the area by specialised hunter-gatherers – known as the 'Early Acacus' Period – which some researchers date to around 11,000 years ago.

        title: Round Head Period
        title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 5'
        body: From around 9,000 years ago, the archaeological record in the Acacus
          changes; sites are larger, featuring more formalised stone structures with
          heavy grinding equipment and large pots. Subsistence strategies based on
          hunting and gathering remain, but archaeological evidence suggests the presence
          of corralling Barbary sheep and the storage of wild cereals. Fragments of
          grinding stones with traces of colour from the Takarkori rock shelter, dating
          from between 6,800–5,400 BC, may have been used as palettes for rock or
          body painting, and have been connected chronologically to the Round Head
          Period. A large proportion of paintings in this period portray very large
          figures with round, featureless heads and can often be depicted in ‘floating’
          positions; women often have their hands raised, interpreted as postures
          of supplication.

          to full pastoral systems in the region is complex and prolonged, so it is
          challenging to track any changes from the rock art itself, but the painting
          of large herds must be connected to a full pastoral society.

        title: Horse and Camel Periods
        title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 7'
        body: |-
          Historical records have tended to date the introduction of both the horse and the camel in northern Africa rather than the archaeological record. Yet, in terms of rock art research in this region, less attention has been given to these styles; the reason for this may be that the earliest rock art attracted more scholarly consideration than the later depictions. However, their representation certainly demonstrates the changing natural and cultural environment and associated human responses and adaptations.

          The rock art of Libya is a visual testament to the changing fortunes of this part of the Sahara and the cultural groups who have occupied and navigated the area over thousands of years. The engravings and paintings act as a legacy, tracing the environmental effects of climate change, how people have adapted to that change and the cultural worlds they have created.

        body: A significant concentration of rock art in Mauritania is in the region
          of Guilemsi, an 11-km long ridge, about 70 m high at its highest point.
          Guilemsi is located in the desert, around 50 km north of the town of Tidjika,
          and about 200 km west of the renowned Neolithic sites at Dhar Tichitt. Guilemsi’s
          south face contains many ravines with rock shelters, and the rock painting
          sites scattered around the area are to be found in open shelters and ridges
          or boulders on the cliff faces, as well as on the stone banks of a dry river.
          These sites are notable both for the solely painted nature of the rock art,
          and the variety of its subject matter.

        body: There are many stone constructions at Guilemsi that have been known
          to archaeologists for decades, although they have not received the academic
          attention that those further to the East in the Tichitt-Walata region had.
          The Dhars Tagant, Tichitt, Walata and Néma form an enormous crescent-shaped
          chain of sandstone escarpments, enclosing much of southern Mauritania and
          associated with a Neolithic ‘Tichitt Tradition’, which is based on the remains
          of over 400 apparent settlements along the escarpment ridges. This culture
          is thought to have existed between about 2,000 BC and 200 BC, based on pastoralism
          and the cultivation of millet, before declining due to the increasing aridity
          of the environment and possible incursion by other cultural groups from
          the North.

          these are found at Guilemsi, although the extent of the connection with
          the Tichitt culture to the East is unclear. The ridge at Guilemsi contains
          many apparent funerary monuments consisting of rectangular stone platforms,
          as well as apparent dwelling structures. Some of the funerary monuments
          appear to be associated with rock shelters, but any connection of the stone
          structures to the rock art remains unknown.

        body: The rock art at Guilemsi appears to be all painted, which marks a contrast
          to Tichitt sites which more often feature engraved rock art. The only non-painted
          rock markings encountered at Guilemsi was several groups of cupules (round,
          man-made depressions in the rock) which were found in three rock shelters.
          Some of the paintings in the area are unusual in themselves- one of the
          most striking is a panel of handprints in red (Fig. 4.), as well as a couple
          of rare paintings appearing to be of big cats, and the heads and finely
          rendered horns of seven antelope, perhaps oryx (Fig. 5.).

          art, are also depicted here, notably in another singular scene: one of an
          otherwise naturalistic cow with dramatically elongated legs, next to an
          artificially inflated-looking human figure (Fig. 8). Domestic cattle were
          present in the area from at least the second Millennium BC, so these paintings
          must post-date this, although whether they are associated with Tichitt-Tradition
          pastoralists or later groups is not known. The fact that even the more normally-proportioned
          cattle representations at Guilemsi are depicted in a variety of styles (Figs.
          6 & 7) while in the same vicinity may suggest successive (or perhaps even
          contemporary) painting by peoples with different stylistic traditions.'

        body: 'Two of the most impressive panels of paintings from Guilemsi involve
          not cattle but another important domesticate: ridden horses. There is evidence
          of horses having reached the far West of North Africa by about 600 AD, but
          horses may have been used in the area much earlier, from the mid-1st Millennium
          BC, if not earlier. Although elsewhere in the Sahara the earliest horse
          images appear to show them used for draught purposes rather than riding,
          in Mauritania, almost all depictions of horses in rock art show them being
          ridden, often by apparently armed riders (eg. Fig. 11). At Guilemsi, there
          are several styles of paintings showing horses and riders: the ‘bi-triangular’
          and stick-figure like styles (Figs. 10 & 11), which have been proposed to
          be associated with early Berber peoples, and another style, showing horses
          with elongated, stylised bodies and short necks (Fig. 9). These horse depictions
          appear to be of a form thus far unrecorded in the rock art of the area,
          and as such are an interesting addition to the known corpus, as Mauritanian
          rock art has not been as thoroughly studied as that of other Saharan countries.'

          right of the panel in Fig. 9, but in executed in a very different style.
          It appears to depict a group of armed horsemen, and warriors on foot, vanquishing
          others who are unmounted, who lie, presumably dead, to the left of the horsemen,
          surrounded by spears. This is an unusually dynamic depiction of conflict,
          and it is not known whether it depicts an imagined or real confrontation,
          or, if real, whether it is the work of an artist from the culture of the
          horsemen or those opposing them.

          It has been suggested that the painting of the horse scenes, in line with similar images from other rock art traditions, may be a cathartic spiritual exercise made, possibly by victims of raids, in response to violent intercultural contact. However as with the other images, without an accurate way of scientifically dating such paintings, it is hard to know exactly when they were painted and therefore difficult to propose of or by whom, much less ascribe motivations. Stone tools and the remains of iron smelting activity at Guilemsi suggest successive occupations, possibly over a long period.

          Stylistic links to other sites may be made, however: despite the fact that some of the iconography at Guilemsi appears quite unique, other elements, such as the bichrome cow in Fig. 6, and other square figures at Guilemsi of a man and giraffe, have similar looking counterparts in the Tichitt region, while the “bi-triangular” horses are found elsewhere in the Tagant and Adrar regions of Mauritania, and even as far away as Chad. Understanding of these links is still nascent, as is the interpretation of most Mauritanian rock art, but the variety present at Guilemsi is a valuable addition to the record, and more such sites may remain to be brought to the notice of scholars.

        title: Geography and rock art distribution
        title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 2'
        body: |-
          In total Mauritania covers about 1,030,700 km², most of which forms part of the western portion of the Sahara desert. The southern part of Mauritania incorporates some of the more temperate Sahelian zone, forming part of the geographical and cultural border between Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa. The landscape of the country is generally characterised by its flatness, but the two major neighbouring plateaux in the East-Centre of the country – the Tagant in the South and the Adrar further North – are furnished with rock shelters, boulders and other surfaces upon which can be found abundant rock art, more often engraved than painted.

          The principal concentrations of rock art in Mauritania are located in these two areas, as well as in the North around Bir Moghreïn (in the Mauritanian extension of the Zemmur mountains), the Hank ridge near the borders of Algeria and Mali and the Tichitt-Walata area to the east of the Tagant plateau.

          __Adrar__

          There are about thirty known rock art sites in the Adrar region, although, as with most Mauritanian rock art, study has not been comprehensive and there may be many more as yet undocumented. Engraved rock art sites dominate along the northern edge of the massif, with some of the most significant to be found at the sites of El Beyyed and El Ghallaouiya. Rarer paintings of cattle are also to be found at El Ghallaouiya, as well as at the site of Amogjar.

          __Tagant__

          Less well studied than Adrar, the Tagant plateau contains several painting sites showing horses and riders such as those at the sites of Agneitir Dalma and Tinchmart. The archaeologically significant area of the Tichitt-Walata ridge, a chain of escarpments known for its Neolithic settlements, is largely located within the wider Tagant region to the east of the plateau, and also features many engravings and some paintings.

          Recording and research on Mauritanian rock art has been limited in comparison with other Saharan rock art traditions, and has mainly been undertaken by French scholars, as Mauritania was formerly part of French West Africa. The first major publications cataloguing rock art sites in the country were those of Théodore Monod (1937-8), based on recordings collected on expeditions made between 1934 and 1936 and covering the entire western Saharan region. Following this, the explorers Marion Senones and Odette du Puigaudeau published some paintings of the Tagant region in1939. A more comprehensive study of the paintings, engravings and inscriptions of West and North West Africa was made by Raymond Mauny (1954), and emphasised the importance of systematically recording and studying the images in their contexts. More recently (1993), Robert Vernet produced a synthesis of known Mauritanian rock art in his *Préhistoire de la Mauritanie*.

          Many individual Mauritanian rock art sites have also been recorded and published over the decades since the 1940s, particularly in the context of associated archaeological sites, such as those at Tegdaoust and in the Tichitt-Walata region.

          The range of subject matter in the rock art of Mauritania is similar to that of other Saharan countries, consisting primarily of images of domestic cattle, along with those of horses both mounted and unmounted, human figures and weaponry, wild fauna, hunting scenes, camels and Libyco-Berber/Tifinagh and Arabic script. Images of goats and sheep are extremely rare.

          Some general geographic tendencies in style and type can be made out, for example, deeply cut and polished naturalistic engravings of large wild animals are concentrated in the North of the country. There is an apparent North-South divide in engraving style, with images becoming more schematic further south. Rarer painting sites are clustered in certain areas such as north of Bir Moghreïn in the far north, and certain Adrar sites, with horse and rider paintings most common in the Tagant and Tichitt-Walata regions.

          Mauritanian rock art consists most commonly of similar-looking scenes of cattle, hunting tableaux, or camel depictions, but there are some exceptions of interest, for example: the monumental bull engraving from Akhrejit in the Dhar Tichitt, which is nearly 5 metres long; the unusually naturalistic paintings of cattle at Amogjar and Tenses in the Adrar; and the curiously shaped painted horses at Guilemsi in the Tagant-Titchitt region.

          In addition, although images of chariots apparently drawn by oxen are known elsewhere in the Sahara, chariots in Saharan rock art are normally associated with horses. In Mauritania, however, there are several images of ox chariots or carts – both painted and engraved – as well as depictions of cattle apparently bearing burdens/saddles, or mounted. Moreover, Mauritania has no known depictions of chariots where the draught animal is identifiably a horse, although there are many images of horses and riders. Sometimes chariots are depicted independent of any animals drawing them, and in all there are over 200 known images of chariots in the country.

          are very difficult to date, especially absolutely. Monod remarked: ‘it is
          impossible to propose even approximate dates: no landmark pinpoints the
          end of the Neolithic and the arrival of Libyan (Berber) horsemen’ (Monod,
          1938, p.128). Relative chronologies of rock art styles are easier to identify
          than specific dates, as they may be based on visible elements such as superimpositions
          in paintings, and the darkness level of accrued patina in engravings. In
          Mauritania, researchers have generally paid particular attention to patina
          as well as themes and styles in order to try and place a timeframe on different
          rock art traditions. Even this is an inexact science – however, Monod did
          propose a three-phase chronology, with 1) ‘Ancient’ prehistoric rock art
          showing large wild fauna and cattle, 2) ‘Middle’ pre-Islamic art showing
          horses, camels, riders, arms and armour, hunting scenes and Libyco-Berber
          script and 3) ‘Modern’ Islamic-era art with modern Tifinagh and Arabic inscriptions.'

          and technique, along the same lines as Monod’s. Mauny’s proposed divisions
          include a ‘naturalist’ period from 5,000–2,000 BC, a cattle pastoralist
          phase from 2,500–1,000 BC, a horse period from 1,200 BC onwards, a ‘Libyco-Berber’
          group from 200 BC–700 AD and a final ‘Arabo-Berber’ phase from 700 AD onwards
          (Mauny, 1954). While the oldest rock art, such as the paintings at Amogjar,
          could be more than 5,000 years old, it appears that most Mauritanian rock
          art probably post-dates 2,000 BC, with some, particularly that involving
          camels, made within the last 2,000 years.

          onwards, and with whom much of the rock art is usually associated. Chariot
          images can be reasonably assumed to date from the time we know chariots

          more on cataloguing the images and categorising them by style, technique
          and perceived age than investigating their potential cultural significance.
          The limitations in the ability to scientifically date these images, and
          the fact that they are not usually associated with other archaeological
          materials, hinders effective attempts at interpretation or ascribing authorship,
          beyond basic ‘Neolithic’ ‘pastoralist’, or ‘early Berber’. Even this may
          not be clear-cut or mutually exclusive: for example, incoming Berber peoples
          in the Adrar Plateau after 2,000 BC are thought to have been cattle pastoralists,
          as their non-Berber predecessors probably were. In addition, while the desertification
          process was definitive from this time on, fluctuations and regional microclimates
          made pastoralism viable relatively recently in some areas – in the Adrar
          there is still evidence of cattle rearing as late as 1,000 BC or after,
          and some areas of the Tagant region may have been able to support cattle
          as late as the 18th century. Thus subject matter alone is not necessarily
          indicative of date or authorship: depictions of cattle may be Berber or
          non-Berber, as old as the 4th millennium BC or as recent as the 1st, if
          not later.'

        body: It is possible to make some more specific inferences based on style.
          Some of the more naturalistic cattle paintings from the Adrar have been
          compared in style to the Bovidian style paintings of the Tassili n’Ajjer
          in Libya, and some of the more geometric designs to others in Senegal and
          Mali. Links have also been suggested between some cattle and symbolic images
          and modern Fulani and Tuareg traditions and iconography. In terms of significance,
          changes to rock art style over time, from naturalistic to schematic, have
          been remarked upon as perhaps somehow reflecting environmental changes from
          savannah to steppe and desert. It has also been debated whether some of
          the geometric symbols and images of riders on horseback were the result
          of conflict, perhaps made by the victims of Berber invasions as catharsis
          or to ward off evil.

        body: At this point, however, such inferences are fragmentary and speculative,
          and it is clear that more comprehensive study of rock art in context in
          the region is desirable, as it potentially holds much interest for the study
          of the history and prehistory of Mauritania. It is also an endangered resource,
          due to a combination of environmental factors, such as extremes of temperature
          which damage and split the rocks, and human interference from looting and
          vandalism.

          Oukaïmeden is an alpine-like valley set 2,630 metres above sea level at the core of Morocco’s High Atlas. Records from the 16th century onwards refer to its seasonal profit as summer pasturage by herders coming from villages settled at mid-altitude. It is a well-known place due to the existence of a ski resort, and a well-frequented tourist destination for people coming from Marrakech during the summer. It is also home to one of the most impressive collections of rock art engravings in Morocco, with about 250 rock art sites and one thousand depictions scattered throughout the valley.
          Oukaïmeden rock art has been thoroughly studied by Malhome (1959, 1961) and Rodrigue (1999), and along with the Yagour plateau and Jbel Rat constitute the core of High Atlas rock art.

        title_internal: 'Morocco: featured site, chapter 2'
        body: High Atlas rock art is remarkably different not only from the rest of
          Moroccan rock art, but also from most other depictions documented throughout
          the Sahara. Although some of the engravings correspond to cattle depictions
          similar to those of nearby regions, there are other images known only in
          this region. One particular type comprises detailed, large human figures
          represented frontally, surrounded by weapons and other symbols. Another
          common kind of depiction is circular shapes with inner designs, which most
          probably represent shields. Weapons are also very common, usually depicted
          in isolation, but not held by warriors as is common in most of the North
          African images. Together with these themes, Oukaïmeden is characterised
          by a significant number of elephant representations (something surprising
          considering its altitude!) and a huge number of complex, geometric symbols
          whose interpretation remains obscure.

        title_internal: 'Morocco: featured site, chapter 3'
        body: Chronologically speaking, it seems Oukaïmeden engravings started to
          appear during the mid-3rd millennium BC, when the Sahara desert became increasingly
          drier and summer grazing became more and more important. The earliest depictions
          consisted mainly of animals, especially cattle, which was the species that
          benefited the most from green pastures. As time passed, pressure on this
          resource grew and tensions arose among the communities that used the valley.
          From the 2nd millennium BC onwards, animal depictions were replaced by images
          of weapons and warriors, showing a different, more violent way of reclaiming
          rights over pastures. That situation continued during the long Libyan-Berber
          period that started around the mid-1st millennium BC and lasted until the
          Muslim conquest of the area, around the 7th century AD. The arrival of Islam
          does not imply the immediate disappearance of rock art engravings, but their
          number decreased significantly and they progressively lost their significance,
          becoming incidental in Oukaïmeden history.

          Although Oukaïmeden rock art is distributed throughout the valley, there are some sites with scenes that stand above the rest due to their complexity and significance. One of them is the so-called Elephants’ Frieze, a horizontal rock face where four elephants, a feline, a rhinoceros or warthog and two human figures facing the animals were depicted. Two later, vertical Libyan-Berber inscriptions were added to the panel. The scene is placed near a shelter, facing a stream which constitutes one of the main access routes to the valley grazing areas.

          The relevance of Oukaïmeden rock art is renowned, and the whole area has been protected since 1951 by the Moroccan government, while the National Centre of Rock Art Heritage in Marrakech has carried on several research projects in the area. However, the interest in the site doesn’t mean its preservation is assured: the growing incidence of tourism, the extraction of stones for building purposes in nearby Marrakech and vandalism are threats that have still to be dealt with. The fragile environment of Oukaïmeden valley adds an extra concern about the preservation of one of the most complete and better-preserved rock sites in Morocco.

        title: Geography and rock art distribution
        title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 2'
        body: Morocco has a very variable geography, with the Atlas Mountains crossing
          the country from the southwest to the northeast and separating the coastal
          plains to the west from the Sahara Desert that runs to the east and south.
          The distribution of rock art in the country is very irregular, with some
          zones crowded with sites and others almost devoid of depictions. The two
          main areas of rock art sites are the High Atlas zone and the area to the
          east and south of the Atlas Mountains. The first area groups more than seven
          thousand engravings around the Oukaïmeden valley, the Yagour plateau and
          the Jebel Rat site. They are at high altitude (more than 2000 metres above
          sea level), and mainly represent weapons, cattle and anthropomorphic figures,
          along with numerous geometric symbols.

        title: Research history
        title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 4'
        body: 'European audiences began studying the rock art in Morocco decades after
          the study of rock art in Algeria and Libya, with the first news of rock
          art coming from French and German travellers late in the 19th century. The
          most significant boost came after the Treaty of Fes in 1912, when the presence
          of the colonial authorities led indirectly to an increasing knowledge of
          rock art sites, as Spanish and French officers started to show interest
          in the engravings. However, it was not until after Moroccan independence
          in 1956 that systematic research began throughout the country. Since then,
          archaeological information has progressively grown, although regional syntheses
          are still scarce: only the Atlas (Malhomme, Rodrigue) and part of southern
          Morocco (Simoneau) have exhaustive catalogues of sites. The first comprehensive
          study of Moroccan rock art was made in 2001 (Searight), when for the first
          time, a global approach to Moroccan rock art areas, themes and chronology
          was undertaken.'

        title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 6'
        body: A consensus has yet to be achieved about Moroccan rock art chronology
          between the supporters of a long chronology, starting around 4000 BC, and
          those that defend a short one, from 2500 BC onwards. The oldest engravings
          represented in Moroccan rock art correspond to the Tazina and Pecked Cattle
          styles, depicting mainly mammals. From the second half of the second millennium
          BC onwards, depictions of human figures start to appear in the High Atlas,
          associated with daggers and shields, defining the so-called Dagger/Halberd/Anthropomorph
          style. During the first millennium BC, Libyan-Berber hunting and battle
          scenes start to appear in southern Morocco; riders, infantrymen and animals
          depicted in a very schematic style. The last period of Moroccan rock art,
          as in the rest of the Sahara, is the so-called Camel Period, characterized
          by the appearance of dromedaries.

          the slopes of the Aïr Mountains. The area has been part of the trans-Saharan
          caravan trade route traversed by the Tuareg for over two millennia, but
          archaeological evidence shows much older occupation in the region dating
          back 8,000 years. More recently, it has become known to a wider global audience
          for its exceptional rock art.

          Recorded in 1987 by French archaeologist Christian Dupuy, two remarkable life-size engravings of giraffe have generated much interest due to the size, realism and technique of the depictions. The two giraffe, thought to be one large male in front of a smaller female, were engraved on the weathered surface of a sandstone outcrop. The larger giraffe measures 5.4 m from top to toe and combines several techniques of production, including scraping, smoothing and deep engraving of the outlines.

          Each giraffe has an incised line emanating from its mouth or nose, meandering down to a small human figure. This motif is not unusual in Saharan rock art, but its meaning remains a mystery. Interpretations have suggested the line may indicate that giraffe were hunted or even domesticated, or may reflect a religious, mythical or cultural association. It has also been suggested that the lines and human figures were later additions.

          The engravings cannot be seen from ground level; they are only visible by climbing onto the boulder. They are thought to date from between 6,000 and 8,000 years ago – a period known as the Neolithic Subpluvial, when environmental conditions were much wetter and the Sahara was a vast savannah stretching for thousands of miles, able to sustain large mammals such as giraffe. The soft sandstone is likely to have been incised using a harder material such as flint; there are chisels of petrified wood in the surrounding desert sands which would have acted as good tools for abrading and polishing outlines. It is easy to imagine people in the past sitting on the rocky outcrop watching these long-necked, graceful animals and immortalising them in stone for future generations.

          We can only speculate as to why the giraffe was selected for this special treatment. Any number of physical, behavioural, environmental or symbolic factors may have contributed to its significance.

          While the giraffe have taken centre stage at this site because of their size and the skill of the execution, a systematic study of the area has identified 828 further engravings, including 704 zoomorphs (animal forms), 61 anthropomorphs (human forms), and 17 inscriptions of Tifinâgh script. The animals identified include: bovines (cattle ) (46%), ostrich (16%), antelope and gazelle (16%), giraffe (16%), and finally 12 dromedaries (camels), 11 canids (dog-like mammals), 6 rhinoceros, 3 equids (horses or donkeys), 2 monkeys, 2 elephants, and 1 lion.

          Who might the artists have been? It is often the case in rock art research that artists are lost to us in time and we have little or no archaeological evidence that can offer insights into the populations that occupied these sites, sometimes only for a short time. However, in 2001 a site called Gobero was discovered that provides a glimpse of life in this region at the time that the Dabous engravings were produced.

        body: Gobero is located at the western tip of the Ténéré desert in Niger,
          approximately 150 km south-east of the Aïr Mountains. Situated on the edge
          of a paleaolake and dating from the early Holocene (7,700–6,200 years ago),
          it is the earliest recorded cemetery in the western Sahara and consists
          of around 200 burials. Skeletal evidence shows both male and females to
          be tall in stature, approaching two metres. Some of the burials included

        body: This cultural group were largely sedentary; their subsistence economy
          was based on fishing (Nile perch, catfish, soft-shell turtles) and hunting
          (hippos, bovids, small carnivores and crocodiles). Microlithis, bone harpoon
          points and hooks, as well as ceramics with dotted wavy-line and zig-zag
          impressed motif were found in burials, refuse areas and around the lake.
          A hiatus in the occupation of the area (6,200–5,200 years ago) occurred
          during a harsh arid interval, forcing the occupants to relocate. The Gobero
          population may not be the artists responsible for Dabous, but archaeological
          evidence can help formulate a picture of the environmental, social and material
          culture at the time of the engravings.

        body: Unfortunately, the engravings have been subject to deterioration as
          a result of human intervention such as trampling, graffiti and fragments
          being stolen. As a result, the decision was made to preserve them by making
          a mould of the carvings in order to make a cast in a resistant material.
          Permission was granted by both the government of Niger and UNESCO and in
          1999 the moulding process took place. The first cast of the mould, made
          in aluminium, stands at the airport of Agadez in the small desert town near
          the site of Dabous – an enduring symbol of the rich rock art heritage of
          the country.

        title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 1'
        body: Niger is geographically diverse, having both the Sahel (savannah) and
          the Sahara (desert). The majority of the country’s rock art – made up predominantly
          of engravings – is located in the northern desert area, in and around the
          Aïr Mountains, where some of the art is thought to be several thousand years
          old. The Djado Plateau in the north-east is also rich in art that includes
          both paintings and engravings. One of the most celebrated sites of rock
          engraving is at a place called Dabous, to the west of the mountains. Here,
          two life-size giraffe were carved on the top of an outcrop, and may be up
          to 6,000 years old. Other notable areas for engravings are Iwellene in the
          northern Aïr Mountains, where some of the art is thought to be several thousand
          years old, as well the sites of Tanakom and Tagueit in the south-eastern
          Aïr Mountains, where engravings are located on the sides of two wadis (dry
          riverbeds).

        body: Links have been made between the rock art of Niger and that of several
          other countries – in particular, between the so-called Libyan Warrior art
          found in the Aïr Mountains and the rock engravings of the Adrar des Iforas
          in Mali. Stylistic similarities also exist with some of the art of the Tadrart
          (Acacus) and in south-east Algeria. Further associations have been made
          between the Early Hunter art of the Djado Plateau and art in south-west
          Libya and south-east Algeria. Equally, similarities have been observed with
          the Tazina-style engravings in south-western Algeria and south-eastern Morocco.

        body: Consisting predominantly of engravings, the majority of depictions in
          this region fall within the so-called Libyan Warrior period or style of
          art, dating from 1,500–3,000 years ago, characterised by forward-facing
          figures with metal weapons and horses. Approximately 1,000 engravings of
          warriors have been recorded from the Aïr Mountains in Niger, as well as
          the Adrar des Iforas in bordering Mali. Based on investigations into the
          garments worn, accessories, headdresses and weaponry, and by studying the
          placement and superimposition of images, it has been proposed that there
          are two main stages of this Libyan Warrior rock art. The oldest is linked
          to a pastoral economy based on cattle-rearing, when metal had been introduced
          to the region and the use of the spear took over from the traditional bow.
          This region also hosts images of wild animals such as Barbary sheep and
          ostrich, as well as cattle.

        body: The number of cattle depictions is small, but particular images of calves
          attached to a lead can be compared stylistically with images of cattle in
          Tassili n’Ajjer, Algeria. Moreover, Henri Lhote noted the resemblance between
          these rock art depictions and the husbandry practices of the present day
          Wodaabe people of Niger, who use a similar calf rope. The calf rope (a long
          rope comprising loops within which the heads of the calves are secured)
          is both practical and symbolic, ensuring the cows always return to their
          home camp, while also physically dividing the camp into male and female
          halves. It is interesting to note the close relationship between the rock
          art of regions that today are politically discrete.

        title: History of rock art discovery in Niger
        title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 7'
        body: Until relatively recently rock art research has been sporadic in Niger.
          In the 1920s Major Gen. Francis Rodd, a British explorer and army officer,
          made two great expeditions into the Sahara. He was the first person to make
          a serious study of the Tuareg and documented some of the rock art in the
          Aïr Mountains. Subsequently, French colonial officers noted some sites around
          1960. However, it was French archaeologist Henri Lhote who undertook major
          recording programmes throughout the 1960s and 1970s to document, trace and
          publish several thousand engravings. Very little information is known relating
          the rock art to known cultural groups, either past or present. Most of the
          sites were not habitation sites, and were probably only occasionally visited
          by nomadic societies in the past, so very little (if any) archaeological
          evidence remains. Most of the art predates the residence of the Tuareg,
          who now inhabit this area and who appear to have no direct connections with
          the art. The Tuareg recognise old script which sometimes accompanies images
          as it closely resembles their own writing, *Tifinagh*; however, it is incomprehensible
          to them if it is more than 100 years old.

        body: Although the Bovidian Period is sparsely represented in comparison to
          other rock art regions, both on the Djado Plateau and the Aïr Mountains,
          this period can probably be dated to between 7,000 and 4,000 years ago.
          A few cattle are depicted in a similar fashion to the big game of the Early
          Hunter Period, which raises the question of whether the nomadic cattle-herding
          culture emerged from a hunting lifestyle, or at least rapidly succeeded
          it.

          the Horse Period and Libyan Warrior Period date from around 3,000–1,500
          years ago. Depictions are of horses with so-called Libyan Warriors, with
          metal weapons or with chariots and charioteers. Human figures, which often
          appear with horses, were sometimes depicted with elaborate apparel; others
          were drawn with stylized bodies consisting of two triangles joined at the
          apex. Wild animals such as Barbary sheep and ostrich, as well as cattle,
          appear in this art. Art of the Horse Period is not widely represented in
          the Djado Plateau, suggesting that Berber groups did not reach the region
          in any great numbers – but it has been proposed that certain peculiarities
          of style may suggest an influence from Aïr.

        body: A small number of engravings from the Camel Period occur on the Djado
          Plateau, but as camels were introduced to the Sahara up to 2,000 years ago,
          the relative lack of depictions suggests that the plateau was scarcely frequented
          during this hyper-arid period.

        body: At the nexus of Sudan, Libya and Egypt, where the borders meet at a
          point in the Eastern Sahara, a large rocky outcrop known as Jebel Uweinat
          peaks at an elevation of nearly 2,000 metres. The massif consists of a large,
          ring-shaped granite mass in the west, with sandstone plateaus in the east
          divided by deep valleys. Jebel Uweinat is so isolated that, until 1923,
          the proliferation of rock art around it had never been documented.

        body: This rock art comes in the form of paintings and engravings, commonly
          of animals and overwhelmingly of domestic cattle – 337 painted sites out
          of 414 that have been counted contain depictions of cattle and cattle herds,
          and there are many further engravings of them. There is a disparity in the
          spread of each artwork technique – the engravings are predominantly at lower
          levels than the paintings, near the base of the mountain and valley floors,
          with the paintings at greater altitude. The images shown here come from
          Karkur Talh, the largest of these valleys, which lies mostly in Sudan.

          but there are also indications of hunting taking place, through engravings
          of wild antelope and dog figures, as well as many engravings of camels.

        title_internal: 'Sudan: featured site, chapter 4'
        body: This variety, and similarities to rock art sites elsewhere in the eastern
          Sahara, has led to conjecture and debate regarding the date and authorship
          of these depictions. Were the engravings and paintings made by the same
          people? Does the difference in drawing styles signify authorship by different
          cultures and at different times? The difficulties in objective dating of
          rock art make these questions difficult to answer, but it seems likely that
          there was a long tradition of painting and engraving here, with much of
          the ‘pastoralist’ rock art with cattle probably made between 5,000 and 7,000
          years ago, some earlier styles possibly as much as 8,500 years ago, and
          other images such as camels made only about 2,000 years ago or less.

        title_internal: 'Sudan: featured site, chapter 5'
        body: Other than giraffes, the lack of large wild animals depicted (e.g. elephants)
          may indicate the climate to have been too dry for them, as during this time
          the area fluctuated in aridity, eventually becoming desert. There are, however,
          permanent springs at Jebel Uweinat and a more temperate microclimate here
          may have allowed pastoralists to subsist while the surrounding area became
          inhospitable. Indeed, despite its present remoteness, evidence suggests
          millennia of successive human presence, and as recently as the early 20th
          century, herders of the Toubou peoples were reported to be still living
          in the area. The camel engravings cannot be much older than 2,000 years,
          because camels were unknown in Africa before that, and the recent discovery
          of an ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription from the Early Middle Kingdom
          serves to confirm that Jebel Uweinat has never really been ‘undiscovered’,
          despite having been unknown to Western geographers prior to the 20th century.

          on exposed rock surfaces and rock shelters, largely of animals, human figures
          and ancient river boats. Most of the published rock art is found in disparate
          geographical areas in the northern section of the country: around the Nile
          valley and close to the country''s north-western and north-eastern borders.
          Images include wild fauna such as antelope, domestic animals like camels,

        title: Geography
        title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 2'
        body: Sudan covers nearly 2,000,000 km² and is geographically diverse, dominated
          in the north by the desert of the southern Sahara and divided by the River
          Nile, which flows north from the capital city of Khartoum at the confluence
          of the Blue and White Niles and is joined by the Atbara River in the east.
          East of the Nile is the arid Nubian Desert, which is part of the larger
          Sahara, flanked at the north east by the Red Sea Hills and at the south
          by clay plains. To the south and west of the country are semi-arid zones
          with seasonal watercourses, with the west dominated by the Jebel Marrah
          volcanic massif, and the Nuba mountain range near the southern border.

        body: Historically, rock art research in Sudan has either been incorporated
          into larger investigations of the area’s rich archaeological history, or,
          as in the Nubian Nile valley, the result of archaeological salvage projects,
          aimed at documenting and conserving archaeological sites and artefacts in
          advance of engineered flooding events, such as the construction of the Aswan
          High dam in the 1960s and the Merowe dam in the early 2000s. This has resulted
          in significant rock art and rock gong discoveries, such as that noted near
          the Second Cataract (Žába, 1967) and more recently around the Fourth. Rock
          art remains vulnerable to damming initiatives – that at Sabu is currently
          under threat by the Kajbar Dam proposal at the Third Cataract. There is
          great scope for further research.

        title: Rock art types
        title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 4'
        body: |-
          The rock art of Sudan is varied across both time periods and geographical regions. Numerous pecked depictions of domestic cattle can be found in the Red Sea Hills (Pluskota, 2006) as well as depictions of both domestic and wild animals closer to the River Nile, such as those found at Jebel Gorgod in a mountainous area near Sesebi (Schiff Giorgini, 1972). Engravings, like those around the Second, Third, and Fourth Cataracts (areas of rocky rapids) are varied in subject matter and in date, ranging from Neolithic engravings of wild and domestic fauna to those with Medieval Christian imagery, for example around the Dal Cataract (Mills, 1965). These are mixed with others from about 4,000 BC onwards which may be contemporary with the Predynastic cultures and Pharaonic periods of ancient Egypt and in northern Sudan, Nubian Kerma culture (known to the ancient Egyptians as the Kingdom of Kush). These include depictions of Nile river boats and later hieroglyphic inscriptions.

          The peripatetic nature of these traceable signatures highlights the need to look beyond modern boundaries when considering ancient rock art traditions of Africa. For millennia prior to the creation of the current Egypt/Sudan border, the highway of the river allowed movement between Egypt and Nubia, the people of the region leaving their marks on a narrow area of fertile land that fostered riverine animals like crocodiles, which are occasionally depicted in the rock engravings. From the 4th millennium BC, following several temperate millennia, savannah animals like giraffe lost their habitat in the increasingly arid environments to east and west, but remain reflected in the rock engravings of what is now desert.

          The range in styles and dates for Sudanese rock art emphasises its nature, not as a particular artistic style, but as personal and cultural manipulations of a specific medium. A number of stone percussive instruments known as rock gongs, which produce a sonorous tone when struck and are often apparently associated with cattle engravings, have stimulated discussion about the uses of rock art sites as multisensory ritual venues.

        title: Chronology
        title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 5'
        body: The understanding of much of Sudanese prehistory as it relates to rock
          art remains subject to debate. Some of the best-preserved and most varied
          rock art of Sudan’s desert regions is situated only metres from the Egyptian
          border in the far north-west corner of the country, in a valley of Jebel
          Uweinat – the enormous sandstone and granite outcrop which serves as a boundary
          between Egypt, Sudan and Libya. Numerous paintings and engravings are found
          here, including images of wild animals, such as giraffe and antelope, humans,
          dogs and many cattle. Some of these paintings have been compared with other
          styles of rock art in the wider Sahara, including the later Pastoral Period
          (Muzzolini, 1995). Others have proposed that a different set of paintings
          in these sites may be older, with a stylistic link (although fragile) with
          the Round Head Period (Van Noten,1978). However, the scholarly community
          recognises the inherent difficulty of formulating conclusions of direct
          links with wider rock art practices. In areas around the Nile, where there
          are similar animal engravings, rock art is also from a wide range of time
          periods.

        title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 6'
        body: 'Ascribing dates to rock art like that at Jebel Uweinat is also uncertain
          and is more difficult than dating images such as the depictions of Nile
          river boats or later Christian cross engravings like those found near the
          Third Cataract, where similar motifs are replicated on contemporary pottery
          and corroborated elsewhere in the archaeological record. Occasionally rock
          art may be found in a dateable stratigraphic context- a giraffe engraving
          at Gala Abu Ahmed in Wadi Howar, an ancient Nile tributary, was recently
          dated to before 1,200-1,300 BC in this way (Jesse, 2005). In general, other
          clues are necessary, for example known domestication dates: wild animal
          images are often superseded with depictions of animals like horses and camels.
          These were only widely known in northeast Africa from the second and first
          millennia BC respectively and are therefore unlikely to be older. However,
          this is not an exact science: examination of the superimpositions and levels
          of patination on some Nile valley cattle engravings show that they were
          made over thousands of years up to the not too distant past. Faced with
          such challenges, classifying rock art by design style, while problematic,
          can prove useful in envisioning chronology.'

        body: The site of Shepe (also known as Chabbé, Šappe or Mancheti) is located
          in the Sidamo Zone of Oromia, about 250 km to the south of Addis Ababa.
          The region is a fertile, forest-mountainous area traditionally dedicated
          to the cultivation of coffee. The site is in a narrow gorge carved by the
          Shepe River at 1300 m above sea level, full of vegetation and therefore
          difficult to detect. Along this gorge there are several notable  engravings
          depicted in four panels, forming one of the most impressive – if secluded
          —  rock art sites in the Horn of Africa. The site was discovered in 1965
          by Fitaorari Selechi Defabatchaw, governor of the Dilla district where the
          site is located, and was published by Francis Anfray two years later. Since
          that, the importance of Shepe has been widely recognized and some other
          sites with similar engravings have been documented in the surrounding area.
          This group (known generically as the Shepe-Galma group) constitutes one
          of the main areas of Ethiopian rock art, the other being the Laga Oda-Sourré
          group in the Harar region.

        body: 'The rock art of Shepe consists almost exclusively of engravings of
          humpless cows which follow very strict conventions: profile bodies, small
          heads with long horns seen from above, U-like bellies and udders very clearly
          depicted. Some of the cows have an unidentified, triangular object hanging
          from their left horn. In total, around 50 relatively large cows (40 to 70
          cm in length) are depicted throughout the gorge walls, distributed in rows
          and groups to represent herds. The most original feature of these engravings
          is, however, the technique used to depict them: rather than carving the
          outline of the cows, the area around them has been lowered to provide a
          bas-relief effect which has no known parallels in the region. The surface
          of the cows has been polished to obtain a smooth appearance.'

        title_internal: 'Ethiopia: featured site, chapter 3'
        body: The chronology of the Shepe cows is difficult to determine, but stylistically
          they have been related to the Laga Oda paintings in the area of Harar and
          to other sites in Eritrea and Djibouti. According to most researchers, the
          Shepe figures have been ascribed to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabian style,
          with a generic chronology from the 3rd to the 1st millennia BC. Shepe engravings
          can be considered relatively naturalistic, and therefore should be among
          the oldest depictions of this style. Other interpretations, however, consider
          Shepe and the nearby sites a completely differentiated school whose chronology
          is still unclear but could be more recent.

        title_internal: 'Ethiopia: featured site, chapter 4'
        body: Regarding their meaning, only conjecture can be made at present, but
          it seems quite likely that they were made by pastoral communities to whom
          cattle were fundamental. The careful depiction of the udders, the repetition
          of this single motif and the effort paid to achieve the bas-relief effect
          imply a paramount importance of cattle in the economy and society of the
          group that engraved them. The fact that some of the cows have what seem
          to be adornments hanging from the horns (a feature documented in other rock
          art regions as the Libyan Messak) also points in that direction. Contemporary
          groups, such as the Nuer in nearby Sudan have similar traditions of horn
          adornments, and throughout the Omo river region different techniques of
          embellishment (ear cutting, horn shaping, modifications of the hump) have
          been documented, and in all of them cattle are a key cultural mark as well
          as an economic resource.  Of course, direct links cannot be established
          between these contemporary examples and the communities that made the engravings
          of Shepe, but the cattle depictions in the ravine are nevertheless a document
          of the importance and consideration given to cattle, an animal which was
          undoubtedly part of these groups’ identity.

        title: Introduction
        title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 1'
        body: Ethiopia is the biggest country of the Horn of Africa, a very diverse
          country which has traditionally been a melting pot of cultures, religions
          and ethnicities, acting as a crossroads between the Nile valley region,
          the Red Sea and East Africa. Most rock art is located in the southern part
          of the country, although smaller concentrations have been documented near
          the borders with Eritrea, Sudan and Kenya. Ethiopian rock art shows strong
          similarities with other countries in the Horn of Africa as well as Sudan
          and mostly consists of cow depictions dated from the 3rd millennium onwards,
          although other animals, anthropomorphic figures and geometric symbols are
          also fairly common.

        title: Geography and rock art distribution
        title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 2'
        body: The geography of Ethiopia is varied and ranges from high plateaus to
          savannahs and deserts.   The eastern part mostly consists of a range of
          plateaus and high mountains, which in some cases reach more than 4000m above
          sea level. To the north of these mountains is Lake Tana, the biggest lake
          in Ethiopia and the source of the Blue Nile, one of the two tributaries
          of the Nile. The mountains are divided in two by the Great Rift Valley,
          which runs north-east to south-west, - and is one of the most important
          areas for the study of human evolution. The highlands are surrounded by
          tropical savannah and grassland regions to the west and south-west, while
          to the east lays the Danakil desert, one of the most inhospitable regions
          on earth. The south-eastern corner of Ethiopia, which borders Somalia, is
          a semi-desert plateau ranging from 300-1500 m above sea level.

        title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 3'
        body: 'Ethiopian rock art is located around two main areas: around the city
          of Harar to the east and the Sidamo region to the south-west. The first
          group comprises mainly painted depictions, while the second one is characterized
          by a bas-relief technique specific only to this area. However, rock art
          has also been discovered in other areas, such as the border with Eritrea,
          the area near Kenya and the Benishangul-Gumuz region, a lowland area along
          the border with Sudan. As research increases, it is likely that more rock
          art sites will be discovered throughout the country. In addition to these
          engravings and paintings, Ethiopia is also known for its decorated stelae,
          tall stone obelisks that are usually engraved with culturally and religiously
          important symbols. One of these places is Tiya, a burial place declared
          a World Heritage Site which has 32 richly decorated stelae. Although not
          strictly rock art in the traditional sense, they nevertheless represent
          one of the most interesting group of archaeological remains in the south
          of Ethiopia and demonstrate similar techniques to some of the engraved depictions.'

        title: Research history
        title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 4'
        body: Ethiopian rock art has played a key role in the Horn of Africa research,
          and the studies undertaken in this country have structured the chronologies,
          styles and interpretations of the whole region. Research started as early
          as the mid-1930s when the Abbé Henri Breuil proposed a classification of
          Ethiopian rock art through the study of the Porc-Epic and Genda-Biftou sites.
          This proposal stated a progressive evolution in eight steps from naturalism
          to schematism, and set the interpretative framework for succeeding decades.
          Breuil’s ideas were generally followed by John Desmond Clark in his synthesis
          of the rock art in the Horn of Africa in 1954, and they also appear in the
          work of Paolo Graziosi (1964). During the 1960s, research was carried out
          by Francis Anfray in the Sidamo area and by Gerard Bailloud near Harar,
          where a report made for the Ethiopian government informed about the existence
          of around ten rock art sites in the same area.

        body: Rock art research in Ethiopia has traditionally included the term Ethiopian-Arabian
          style, coined in 1971 by Červiček to show the similarities between the depictions
          found in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The existence of
          this style is currently the paradigm used in most rock art interpretations
          of the region, although some concerns have been raised due to its too generic
          characteristics, which can be found in many other parts of Africa.  The
          1990s and 2000s have seen a remarkable increase of rock art research in
          the country, with the renewal of studies in the main areas and the beginning
          of research in the regions of Tigray and Benishangul-Gumuz.

        title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 6'
        body: Cattle and cattle-related depictions are the main subject of Ethiopian
          rock art, regardless of their relative chronology. The oldest depictions
          (based on Červiček’s works) are of humpless cows, while in the late stages
          of rock art humped cows and camels appear. Goats, sheep and dogs are very
          occasionally depicted, and unlike the Saharan rock art, wild animals such
          as giraffes and antelopes are scarce. Figures of cattle appear alone or
          in herds, and the depictions of cows with calves are a fairly common motif
          not only in Ethiopia but in the whole Horn of Africa.

        body: The other main group of depictions is of anthropomorphs, which are usually
          schematic and often distributed in rows. In some cases, the tendency to
          schematism is so pronounced that human figures are reduced to an H-like
          shape. Sometimes, human figures are represented as warriors, carrying weapons
          and on occasion fighting against other humans or big felines. Along with
          these figurative themes, geometric signs are very common in Ethiopian rock
          art, including groups of dots and other motifs that have been interpreted
          as symbols associated with groups that historically lived in the region.

        body: 'Not all themes are distributed in every area. In Sidamo, almost all
          figures depict humpless cows, while subjects in the Harar region show a
          far bigger variability. Again, differences in techniques are also evident:
          while depictions in the Harar region are mainly paintings, in Sidamo many
          figures are engraved in a very singular way, lowering the area around the
          figures to achieve a bas-relief effect. The clear differences between the
          Sidamo engravings (known as the Chabbé-Galma group) and those of the Harar
          (the Laga Oda-Sourré group) have led to criticisms about the perceived uniformity
          of the *Ethiopian-Arabian* style.'

        title: Chronology
        title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 9'
        body: As is the case with most African rock art, absolute dates for depictions
          based on radiocarbon techniques are scarce, and therefore most of the chronological
          framework of Ethiopian rock art has to rely on the analysis of figures,
          superimpositions, parallels with depictions of better known areas and other
          indirect dating methods. In Ethiopian rock art it is generally assumed that
          the oldest depictions could be dated to the mid-third millennium BC, according
          to parallels with other Saharan rock art. As aforementioned, the so-called
          Ethiopian-Arabian style shows an evolution from naturalism to schematism,
          with an older group (Sourré-Hanakiya) showing strong similarities with rock
          art in Egypt, Sudan and Libya. A second, progressively schematic group (Dahtami)
          would last until the end of the first millennium BC. This date is supported
          by the appearance of camels and humped cows (zebus), which were introduced
          in the region at the end of the second half of the 1st millennium BC. The
          last stages of Ethiopian rock art relating to camel, warriors and geometric
          depictions can be considered to belong to the historical period, in some
          cases reaching very near to the present day.

        body: 'Lake Victoria is the largest lake in Africa, and at 69,484km², the
          second largest in the world by surface area.   Sitting in a depression in
          the plateau between the eastern and western valley branches of the geological
          East African Rift System, its shores are in Uganda, Tanzania, and to the
          south-east, in Kenya.   Mfangano Island, rising 300m out of the lake near
          the Kenyan shore, is home to some of the most prominent rock painting sites
          in the country, featuring abstract patterned paintings thought to have been
          created between 1,000 and 4,000 years ago by  hunter-gatherers.   The rock
          paintings on Mfangano Island are found at two principal sites:  in a cave
          near the sea known as Mawanga, and at a rock shelter further inland called
          Kwitone.'

        body: Mawanga is a roughly triangular limestone cavern, about 18m wide across
          the mouth and 12m deep.  The roof slopes sharply to the back towards a raised
          platform against the rear of the left wall, on which 12 images of concentric
          circles and spirals in white and red have been painted. Kwitone has similar
          paintings, situated at one end of a long overhang in a sandstone cliff,
          below the shoulder of a ridge.  The rock art at Kwitone is at the far end
          on the shelter wall, several metres above a cleared floor section. The paintings
          here feature 11 distinct shapes including concentric circles and oblongs.
          One of these is a prominent sunburst pattern in brown, with rays emanating
          from the outermost band. The images are larger than those at Mawanga, averaging
          around 40cm in diameter, and less faded, exhibiting more brown pigment,
          although both sites appear to reflect the same artistic tradition. These
          are finger paintings, with pigment probably made of haematite or white clay
          mixed with a natural binder such as egg white or urine. There is evidence
          that the surface may also have also been prepared prior to painting, by
          polishing, and that some of the images may have reapplied or retouched over
          time.

        body: The circular shapes seen here are typical of an apparent wider East
          and Central African rock art tradition featuring a preponderance of circular
          motifs, usually attributed to people known as the Batwa, a Bantu-origin
          name for  a series of culturally related groups historically living around
          Africa’s Great Lakes region and more widely throughout Central Africa.  Like
          the San people, who are known to have been the creators of most of the famous
          rock art of Southern Africa, Batwa were traditionally hunter-gatherers,
          and are considered the most ancient indigenous populations of the area.
          In the early 20th century, it was proposed that East African rock art of
          this tradition could have been the work of ancestral San people, but it
          is now generally assumed to be of Batwa origin with, for example, possible
          parallels to be seen in the symbolic iconography with contemporary barkcloth
          designs of the related Mbuti people from the Democratic Republic of Congo

        body: 'Further examples of apparently Batwa origin rock art can be seen in
          neighbouring Uganda and Tanzania, a reminder that contemporary political
          borders do not reflect physical partitions in the spatial coverage of rock
          art traditions.  Lolui Island, about 50km north west of Mfangano Island
          and  in Ugandan waters, is another important Lake Victoria rock art environment,
          featuring both painting sites and rock gongs (sonorous natural percussive
          instruments with the wear of use) which seem to be associated with the painting
          sites. There are also numerous sets of cupules—ground circular depressions
          in the rocks.  Some of these are referred to locally as Omweso, due to their
          bearing some resemblance to  the depressions used for holding gaming pieces
          in the so-named local variant of the Mancala-type board games played widely
          throughout eastern Africa.  However, their original significance and use
          is unknown.   Cupule sites are also found on the Kenyan mainland and on
          Mfangano island.  Many of these are clearly anthropogenic, however an unusual
          phenomenon is to be noted in the spectacular array of naturally formed cupule-like
          depressions in the limestone of Mawanga cave. This may remind us to exercise
          caution in ascribing ‘rock art’ status to all apparently patterned rock
          formations. The cause of these multitudinous small depressions is so far
          unknown. '

        body: 'The rock art sites of the eastern Lake Victoria region retain spiritual
          connotations for the communities living around them, even if their denoted
          modern significance differs from that envisioned by the original artists.
          The modern inhabitants of Mfangano Island are the Abasuba people, a Bantu
          language-speaking group unrelated to the Batwa who have nevertheless appropriated
          the sites as arenas of spiritual importance.  Members of the Wasamo clan
          in the area around Mawanga remember their having used the site for rain
          making rituals until a few decades ago, with red and white pigment apparently
          representing the moon and sun respectively.  Soot on the cave roof may indicate
          other recent human activity there. When the archaeologist James Chaplin—who
          first investigated the Kwitone site in the 1960s—visited it later, he was
          told by local Wagimbe clan people that they also held the paintings there
          to be associated with some taboos, and connected it with ancestor worship.
          These beliefs reflect events of the recent past, as the Abasuba only moved
          into the area in the last 400 years.  This followed an earlier occupation
          by Luo peoples, prior to which habitation by the Batwa is assumed. The local
          importance of the sites is highlighted in their stewardship by the Abasuba
          Peace Museum, which fosters a continuing relationship with the sites and
          those who live around them. '

        title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 1'
        body: Rock art is distributed widely throughout Kenya, although historically
          rock art research has not been as extensive as in neighbouring countries
          such as Tanzania. Some of Kenya's various rock art traditions are attributed
          to or associated with the ancestors of modern regional cultural groups,
          and as such sites sometimes retain local religious importance. Both painted
          and engraved imagery tends towards the symbolic and geometric, with occasional
          depictions of schematic animals and people. It must be noted that there
          are still probably many Kenyan rock art sites which have not yet become
          known outside of their local communities, if they are known at all.

          stretches from a low-lying eastern coastal strip, inland to highland regions
          in the west of the country. Kenya's western half is divided by the eastern
          section of the East African Rift, the long area of tectonic divergence which
          runs from the coasts of Djibouti, Eritrea and Somalia down through Ethiopia
          and Kenya and into Uganda, curving around the eastern edge of the Lake Victoria
          basin. There are a significant number of painted rock art sites throughout
          west-central and southern Kenya.

        title: Research history
        title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 3'
        body: 'Although researchers had been noting and investigating rock art in
          the neighbouring countries of Tanzania and Uganda from the early years of
          the 20th Century, the first published mention of Kenyan rock art appeared
          only in 1946, with Joy Adamson''s descriptions of engravings at Surima,
          in the northern Turkana region. It was in the 1960s that sustained academic
          attention began to be paid to other sites in the country. In 1961 Richard
          Wright published an account of a rock shelter (now known as Kiptogot Cave)
          with painted images of cattle on the slopes of Mount Elgon near Kitale.
          Wright suggested potential parallels in style with some Ethiopian pastoralist
          rock art. In 1968 Robert Soper was the first archaeologist to investigate
          the unique Namoratung’a burial sites to the east of Lake Turkana, with their
          engraved standing stones, the interpretation of which would be continued
          with the work of Mark Lynch and Lawrence Robbins in the 1970s. In the same
          decade significant painting sites at Lake Victoria, north of the lake near
          the Ugandan border, and in the far south were also reported on by James
          Chaplin, Osaga Odak and Richard Gramly. Research and discovery has continued
          and is likely that many rock art sites in Kenya remain to be documented.
          As recently as 2005, 21 previously unknown rock art sites in the Samburu
          area of central Kenya were recorded during dedicated survey work organised
          by the British Institute in East Africa.    '

        title: Themes
        title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 4'
        body: "Figurative imagery only features prominently in about 10% of the known
          rock art sites of Kenya.  That which exists tends to consist of very schematic
          images of cattle, wild animals and people. The majority of both painted
          and engraved rock art iconography throughout Kenya comprises symbols, with
          common patterns including circles, sometimes concentric or containing crosses,
          spirals, parallel or cross-hatched lines and curvilinear shapes.  Circular
          ground  depressions in the rock surface, known as cupules, are also a common
          variant of rock art in Kenya, along with rock gongs, which show evidence
          of the use of natural rock formations as percussive instruments.\n\nInterpretation,
          cultural attribution and proposed dates for these works vary widely across
          technique and area, although there are common themes.  It has been suggested
          that the schematic nature and similarities in the art may point to shared
          East African symbolic understandings common to different cultural groups,
          for example equating circular shapes (some of the most popular motifs in
          Eastern and Central African rock art in general) with chieftainship or the
          sun, or acting as navigation devices.\n\nGiven the variations in distance,
          age and nature of the sites, there is a danger of generalising, but there
          are factors which may contribute to more incisive interpretations of specific
          sites and symbols.  One set of interpretations for geometric shapes in Kenyan
          rock art points to the similarities of certain of these symbols to cattle
          brands used by Nilotic peoples throughout Kenya, including the Turkana,
          Samburu and Masai groups.  Although the engravings at Namoratung'a are not
          thought to have been made by ancestral Turkana people, Lynch and Robbins
          noted the similarities of some of the symbols found there to contemporary
          local Turkana cattle brands.  These symbols are pecked on stones at graves
          containing mens’ remains and have been proposed to represent male lineages,
          as animal brands traditionally do in contemporary Nilotic ethnic groups.
          Further south, it is known that some more recent rock paintings representing
          brand and shield patterns were made by  Masai and Samburu men, in shelters
          used for meat-feasting—a  practice forbidden in their home compounds after
          their formal initiation as warriors—or as initiation sites. Actual representations
          of cattle are rare, with the vibrant paintings at Kakapel near the Ugandan
          border the most reknowned. Their creators are unknown although Masai and
          Samburu have been known to paint occasional schematic cattle in the past.

        title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 5'
        body: Not all of Kenya's rock art is associated with pastoralists. Much of
          the symbolic art, particularly to the south and west, is attributed to the
          ’Batwa’, ancestors of modern Batwa and related, traditionally hunter-gatherer
          cultural groups living around the Great Lakes Region of East and Central
          Africa.  Circular designs and “Sunburst” symbols are some of the most common
          motifs usually  associated with the Batwa rock art tradition; it has been
          proposed that they may have been associated  with fertility or rainmaking.
          Some rock art on Mfangano Island, in the Kenyan portion of Lake Victoria,
          has retained the latter association, having been used until the recent past
          by local Abasuba people for rainmaking purposes, despite their not having
          produced it originally. This re-use of symbolic sites in Kenya and the difficulty
          of dating further confuses the question of attribution for the art. The
          same rock art sites used by different cultural groups at different times
          and for different reasons. Such is the case at Kakapel for example, where
          it is posited that the earliest paintings may be hunter-gatherer in origin,
          with more recent cattle images added later, and Namoratung’a, with some
          engravings apparently hundreds of years old and others made within the last
          century.

        title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 6'
        body: It is instructive to consider the use of rock art sites within their
          physical contexts as well as the rock art motifs themselves.  Locality and
          landscape are significant, for example at Namoratung’a, where the engraved
          basalt pillars at a related nearby site have been posited to be positioned
          according to astronomical calculations, based on an ancient Cushitic calendar.  There
          are various ways in which the creation and continued use of sites in Kenya
          may have been significantly interactive, such as in the ritual playing of
          rock gongs, or in the potential use of rows of cupules as gaming boards
          for forms of Mancala, a token game common through central and Southern Africa
          which was originally introduced to Kenya via Indian Ocean trade.  It is
          not known if cupules were actually created for this purpose—it has been
          suggested for example that  in some areas, cupules were formed for purely
          practical purposes, in the pulverising of food or materials for smelting
          activities. In Kenya, as elsewhere, what actually constitutes rock art is
          not always easy to identify.

        title: Chronology
        title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 7'
        body: "Rock art ascribed to Batwa peoples could be anywhere between 15,000-1,000
          years old, while pastoralist art is more recent.  Radiocarbon dating of
          rock art is difficult unless it is buried and associated with other uncontaminated
          organic remains and as such, scientifically dated rock art from Kenya is
          rare.  Radiocarbon dates from human remains in graves at Namoratung’a South
          date from the mid-1st Century BC to the mid-1st Millennium AD, but as dates
          like these are not directly relatable to the rock art, researchers have
          tended to concentrate on assigning chronologies based on varying levels
          of patination and style, without being able to ascribe more than estimated
          production dates.  \n\nThere are occasionally defining limits which aid
          in dating  specific sites, for example, cattle did not arrive in Eastern
          Africa until about 2,000 BC, so representations of cattle must postdate
          this.  In addition, in some cases, artworks known to have been associated
          with certain groups cannot have been produced prior to, or post, certain
          dates for political reasons. For example, Masai paintings at Lukenya Hill
          are known to have been painted prior to 1915, as Masai people were displaced
          from this area by European settlers after this date.  \n\nThe diversity
          of Kenyan rock art in motif, distribution and cultural context so far frustrates
          any attempts for a cohesive chronology, but the continuing local engagement
          with rock art sites in Kenya can potentially serve as a useful dating and
          interpretive resource for researchers alongside continuing archaeological
          research."

        body: 'Namzeze, one of the most emblematic sites in the Chongoni rock art
          area, is currently one of the three that can be visited and is open to the
          public.  Unlike many of the other sites, which are grouped together, the
          Namzeze shelter is isolated in the centre of the protected area.  Located
          in a position overlooking the valley towards the Chongoni Hill, the impressive
          rock face of Namzeze contains some of the best examples of both traditions
          of Malawian rock art, the red schematic and white paintings.  The site also
          has a strong symbolism for the Chewa people who still inhabit the area and
          for whom the white paintings of the later period still have deep spiritual
          implications. '

        body: "The superimpositions in the panel above show that the red, schematic
          paintings covering most of the rock face are undoubtedly older than those
          made in white.  Representations include a multitude of geometric signs:
          series of parallel lines, grid-style shapes, concentric ovals and circular
          shapes made with series of dots.  In some cases the red signs were infilled
          with series of tiny white dots, a feature uncommon in the red schematic
          rock art depictions but with the best examples represented here in Namzeze.
          \ Its interpretation, as with most geometric depictions, is a challenging
          issue, but these types of paintings have been traditionally related to ancestors
          of  Batwa people, hunter-gatherers, who inhabited the region until the 1800s.
          \ Studies of Batwa ethnography and cosmology point to these places as related
          to fertility and rainmaking ceremonies.  It is difficult to establish the
          chronology.  The oldest occupation documented in the region is dated to
          the mid-first millennium BC, and the red images precede the arrival of the
          Chewa people in the 2nd millennium AD, responsible for the white paintings
          style, but there is no datable evidence for the paintings.  \n"

        body: The second type of painting found in Namzeze is radically different
          and depicts mainly quadrupeds and birds, as well as some geometric symbols
          and a car, proof of a relatively recent date for some of these paintings.
          Quadrupeds have a very characteristic rectangular body and hooves that in
          some cases are represented as feet.  The technique is very different too,
          consisting of white clay daubed on the wall with the fingers.  These white
          figures usually appear surrounding the previous depictions, in some rare
          occasions overlapping them.  In this case, the authorship, chronology and
          interpretation of the paintings are more straightforward.  Researchers agree
          that these types of paintings have been made by the Chewa, a group of farmers
          that arrived to the region around the 16th century and have maintained rock
          art painting traditions until the 20th century (as the car represented in
          this shelter proves).

        body: 'Regarding the interpretation of the paintings, they are directly related
          to the *nyau*, a secret society of the Chewa and other neighbouring groups
          in Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique which plays a significant role in funerary
          and girl’s initiation ceremonies.  The *nyau* rituals include dancing and
          rely heavily on the use of masks, including face masks as well as other
          mobile structures carried by one or two people.  These masks are central
          for the *nyau* secret society and are kept in secret, hidden from non-initiates.  The
          white paintings of Namzeze and many other sites have been interpreted as
          representations of masks, depicted during initiation ceremonies that took
          place in these isolated shelters where secrets of the *nyau* were explained
          to the new initiates.  '

        body: "In fact, some of the more than 100 types of masks can be easily identified
          in the rock shelters.  The most common is the *kasiyamaliro*, a big structure
          representing an antelope, with a rectangular shape and meant to be carried
          by two people (an [excellent example](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=472359&partId=1)
          can be seen in Room 25 in the British Museum), but others, such as the *Galimoto*
          (a car structure) and birds are also documented.  Some of the features of
          the animals depicted in this panel corroborate with this interpretation:
          the shape of the hooves which is more similar to feet, and the fact that
          in some cases the feet of the forelegs and the hind legs are facing each
          other, as if they corresponded to two different people. Some researchers
          have interpreted this feature as a pictorial tool to teach people the proper
          way of wearing and using the structure to avoid stumbling, which would expose
          the men hidden in the structure and thus the secret of the mask would be
          revealed.  \n"

          a very specific period of time (before that other styles of white paintings
          were used), when the secret society was persecuted first by Ngoni invaders
          in the 19th century, then by missionaries and colonial governments in the
          20th century. With their traditional practices and places forbidden, the
          members of this society had to look for alternative ways to teach the secrets
          of the secret society secrets, with the paintings starting to represent
          *nyau* objects, to be used as a didactic tool.  The Namzeze paintings show
          very explicitly the adaptability of societies to their different challenges
          and historical contexts. Either as a tool to summon the rain or as a coded
          message to transmit sacred secrets, the painted symbols depicted in Namzeze
          show the incredible complexity of rock art meanings throughout time, and
          their importance for the communities that painted them.  \n"

        body: "Malawi is a landlocked country in south-eastern Africa, located between
          Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. It stretches from north to south with the
          eastern boundary of the country marked by the Lake Malawi. Rock art can
          be found throughout the country but is especially abundant in central Malawi,
          near the western border with Mozambique. It consists exclusively of paintings
          attributed to two very distinctive groups (hunter-gatherers and farmers),
          and shows obvious links with other sites located in Zambia and western Mozambique.
          The images consist mainly of animals, anthropomorphic figures and geometric
          symbols, with a chronology that ranges from the Late Stone Age to the 1950s.

          runs from north to south and which contains Lake Malawi (also known as Lake
          Nyasa). Almost 600 km long and more than 50 km wide, Lake Malawi is the
          second biggest lake in Africa and a key geographical feature of Malawi and
          the surrounding countries, as well as an important economic resource for
          the country. The rest of the country west of the Rift Valley is dominated
          by high plateaus, mostly ranging from 900-1200 m above sea level but reaching
          2500 m in the Nyika Plateau to the north and 3000 m at Mt. Mulanje, to the
          south. The climate is equatorial, with strong seasonal differences, and
          hotter in the southern part of the country. '

        body: 'Although rock art can be found in several areas in Malawi, the main
          concentration of sites is located in the Chongoni area, in the westernmost
          part of central Malawi, very near the border with Mozambique. In that area
          around 150 rock art sites have been located so far, belonging to the two
          main traditions of rock art found in the country. Other smaller concentrations
          of rock art can be found to the south and to the north-west, and around
          the southern side of Lake Malawi. The distribution of the different styles
          of Malawian rock art varies substantially: while the older paintings attributed
          to hunter-gatherers can be found everywhere throughout the country, those
          made by farmers are concentrated in the Chongoni area, as well as nearby
          areas of Mozambique and Zambia. Rock art is usually scattered throughout
          the landscape, in hilly areas where gneiss outcrops provide shelters and
          well-protected surfaces adequate for painting.  '

        title: Research history
        title_internal: 'Malawi: country, chapter 4'
        body: 'Rock art in Malawi has been documented by Europeans since at least
          the 1920s, although it wasn’t until the 1950s when the first articles on
          the subject were published, and it was only in 1978 a first synthesis on
          Malawian rock art was undertaken (Lindgren, N.E.  & Schoffeleers, J.M. 1978).
          In the 1980s research increased, especially on Chongoni rock art as its
          importance as a secret society artefact became evident. In 1995 the Chongoni
          rock art area was comprehensively studied by Benjamin Smith as a part of
          his doctoral research (1995), which is still the main reference on the topic.
          Most of the research on Malawi rock art has focused on the study of the
          two different painting traditions found in Malawi. A basic proposal was
          made in 1978 when the red paintings—mostly geometric—considered older and
          attributed to hunter-gatherers, while white paintings were related to more
          modern groups of farmers which arrived early in the 2nd millennium AD and
          preserved their painting traditions until the 1950s. Since 1978, the knowledge
          of these two groups has substantially improved, with a more refined proposal
          made by Benjamin Smith in his doctoral dissertation.  '

          styles, chronologies and production contexts. The first one is characterized
          by red schematic paintings with parallels in Central Africa from Malawi
          to Angola. These paintings are associated with the ancestors of modern Batwa
          hunter-gatherers, and can be classified into two different types. The first
          can be considered the most characteristic and is represented by circles
          with radiating lines, concentric circles, ovals, wavy or parallel lines.
          In some cases, red figures are infilled in white painting or white dots.
          The second type is very scarce (only two examples have been found in Chongoni)
          and depicts very schematic animals, sometimes accompanied by humans. Both
          types are finely executed with red oxide pigment. Regarding their interpretation,
          the figures seem to have been associated with rainmaking and fertility concepts. '

        body: 'The second and more modern rock art tradition found in Malawi is represented
          by white figures made with white clay daubed onto rock surfaces with the
          finger. Associated with the agriculturalist Chewa people, the depictions
          usually represent zoomorphic, spread-eagled or snake-like figures which
          could represent mythological beings, sometimes accompanied by geometric
          symbols.  As in the case of the schematic figures, two types of paintings
          have been proposed: those related to spread-eagled figures and those representing
          zoomorphs (animal-like figures). The paintings were made until several decades
          ago, as testified by depictions of cars that can be found at some sites.
          In this case, the interpretation of the paintings is straightforward, as
          the images depicted can still be related to current rituals often employing
          masks in a variety of shapes.  The spread-eagled paintings may be associated
          with a Chewa girl’s initiation ceremony and would act as a mnemonic tool
          during the ritual, while the zoomorphic paintings may depict spirit characters
          of the Chewa men’s secret society, the *nyau*. In many cases, these paintings
          can overlap the older red paintings already existing at some sites'

          is generally assumed that Late Stone Age hunters and gatherers made this
          rock art. Unfortunately no datable evidence has been found although groups
          of these people survived until the 1800s in Malawi. For the white paintings,
          chronologies are more accurate: the Chewa people are thought to have arrived

        body: Laas Geel, one of the most important rock art sites in the region, is
          located in the north-western part of the Horn of Africa, in Somaliland,
          in the road that links Hargeisa and Berbera. The site is placed on a granite
          outcrop that rises from a plateau at an altitude of 950 meters above sea
          level, at the confluence of two seasonal rivers, a key fact to explain the
          existence of rock art in the outcrop. Even today, the name of the site (“the
          camel’s well” in Somali) makes reference to the availability of water near
          the surface of the wadis. The panels are placed at three different levels
          and distributed mostly throughout the eastern flank of the outcrop, although
          isolated depictions can be found in other slopes.

        body: The site was discovered in 2002 by a French team led by Xavier Gutherz
          which studied the beginning of Pastoralism in the Horn of Africa. Along
          with the paintings, lithic tools were found scattered throughout the site,
          and tombs marked with stelae and mounds can be seen in the neighbourhood.
          The paintings are distributed along 20 rock shelters, the biggest being
          around 10 meters long. Most of them correspond to humpless cows with curved
          or lyre-like white horns (sometimes with reddish tips) and marked udders.
          Paintings are enormously colourful, including red, white, black, violet,
          brown and yellow both isolated and combined. However, the most distinctive
          feature of these cows is their necks, depicted rectangular, abnormally wide
          and either blank or infilled with red and white stripes, either straight
          or wavy. These strange necks have been interpreted as mats hanging from
          the actual neck, in what could be interpreted as a ceremonial ornament.

        body: 'Cows appear isolated or in groups of up to fifteen, although no clear
          representation of herds can be made out, and they are often associated with
          human figures with a very standardized shape: frontally depicted with arms
          outstretched to the sides, and wearing a kind of shirt, usually white. Heads
          are small and sometimes surrounded by a halo of radial dashes as a crown.
          These figures always appear related to the cows, either under the neck,
          between the legs or behind the hindquarters. In some cases they carry a
          bow, a stick or a shield. Along with humans and cows, dogs are well represented
          too, usually positioned near the human figures. Other animals are much scarcer:
          there are some figures that could correspond to antelopes, monkeys and two
          lonely depictions of a giraffe. Throughout most of the panels, geometric
          symbols are also represented, often surrounding the cows.'

        body: Unlike many other rock art sites, Laas Geel has been dated quite precisely
          thanks to the excavations carried out in one of the shelters by the French
          team that documented the site. During the excavation parts of the painted
          rock wall were recovered, and therefore the archaeologists have proposed
          a chronology of mid-4th to mid-3rd millennia, being one of the oldest evidences
          of cattle domestication in the Horn of Africa and the oldest known rock
          art site in this region. Unfortunately, although bovine bones were recovered
          from the excavation, they were too poorly preserved to determine whether
          they correspond to domestic or wild animals.

        body: When discovered, Laas Geel was considered a unique site, and although
          its general characteristics corresponded to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabic
          style, its specific stylistic features had no parallels in the rock art
          of the region. As research has increased, some other sites, such as Dhaga
          Koure, Dhambalin and Karin Hagane, have provided similar depictions to those
          of Laas Geel, thus reinforcing the idea of a distinctive “Laas Geel” style
          which nevertheless must be interpreted within the broader regional context.

        title: Introduction
        title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 1'
        body: Somalia is a country located at the corner of the Horn of Africa, bordered
          by Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya. Somaliland self-declared independence from
          Somalia in 1991 although the government of Somalia has not recognised this
          and views it as an autonomous region. A cultural and economic crossroads
          between Middle East, Africa and Asia, this area has historically been the
          centre of trade routes that linked these regions. It also has a very rich
          rock art heritage which has only recently been started to be studied in
          depth. Most of the known depictions correspond to painted or engraved cattle
          scenes, often accompanied by human figures, dogs and other domestic animals,
          although some warriors, camels and geometric symbols (sometimes interpreted
          as tribal marks) are common too.

        title: Geography and rock art distribution
        title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 2'
        body: 'The geography of Somaliland is characterized by a coastal semi-desert
          plain which runs parallel to the Gulf of Aden coast, crossed by seasonal
          rivers (wadis) which make possible some grazing during the rainy season.
          Farther to the south, this semi-desert plain gives rise to the Karkaar Mountains.
          These mountains, which run from Somaliland into the region of Puntland in
          Somalia, have an average height of 1800 meters above sea level and run west
          to east until Ras Caseyr (Cape Guardafui) where the north and east coasts
          of the Horn of Africa meet. Southward to the mountains there is a big, dry
          plateau known as the Ogo, whose western part (the Haud) is one of the few
          good grazing areas in the country. The Ogo plateau occupies much of central
          and eastern Somalia, which to the south is characterized by the two only
          permanent rivers in the country, the Jubba and the Shabeele, born in the
          Ethiopian highlands and running to the south. Regarding rock art, the distribution
          of the known rock art sites shows a high concentration in Somaliland, with
          only some sites located to the south in the Gobolka Hiiraan region. However,
          this distribution could be a result of lack of research in other areas. '

        title: Research history
        title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 3'
        body: A reconstruction of rock art research history is challenging due to
          its contemporary history. To begin with, during the colonial period the
          country was divided in three different territories (British, Italian and
          French) with very different trajectories, until 1960 when the British and
          Italian territories joined to create Somalia. In British Somaliland the
          first studies of rock art were carried out by Miles Burkitt and P.E. Glover
          in the 1940s, and the first general overview was published in 1954 by J.D.
          Clark, as a part of a regional synthesis of the Horn of Africa prehistory,
          followed by limited research done by Italians in the north-east region in
          the late 1950s. Since then, research has been limited, with some general
          catalogues published in the 1980s and 1990s, although political instability
          has often prevented research, especially in the south-eastern region of
          Somalia. In fact, most rock art information comes from wider regional syntheses
          dedicated to the Horn of Africa.  In the early 2000’s the discovery of the
          Laas Geel site led to a renewed interest in rock art in Somaliland, which
          has allowed a more systematic study of archaeological sites. Nowadays, about
          70 of these sites have been located only in this area, something which shows
          the enormous potential of rock art studies in the Horn of Africa.

          relationship between the rock art found in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian
          Peninsula. According to this proposal, there was a progressive evolution
          from naturalism to schematism, perceptible in the animal depictions throughout
          the region. Wild animals seem to be largely absent but for Djibouti, while
          cattle depictions seem to have been fundamental elsewhere, either isolated
          or in herds. Such is the case with rock art in this region, where cows and
          bulls are the most common depictions, in many cases associated to human
          figures in what seems to be reverential or ritual scenes. In some of the
          sites, such as Laas Geel, the necks of the cows have been decorated with
          complex geometric patterns interpreted as a kind of mat used in special
          occasions to adorn them.

        body: Along with cattle, other animals were represented (humped cows or zebus,
          dogs, sheep, dromedaries), although to a much lesser extent. Wild animals
          are very rare, but giraffes have been documented in Laas Geel and elephants
          and antelopes in Tug Gerbakele, and lions are relatively common in the schematic,
          more modern depictions. Human figures also appear, either distributed in
          rows or isolated, sometimes holding weapons. Geometric symbols are also
          common, usually associated with other depictions. In Somalia, these symbols
          have often been interpreted as tribal or clan marks. With respect to techniques,
          both engraving and painting are common, although paintings seem to be predominant.

        title: Chronology
        title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 6'
        body: As in many other places, the establishment of accurate chronologies
          for Somaliland rock art is challenging. In this case, the lack of long term
          research has made things more difficult, and most hypotheses have been based
          in stylistic approaches, analysis of depictions and a small set of radiocarbon
          data and archaeological excavations. According to this, the oldest depictions
          could be dated to between the mid-3rd and the 2rd millennium BC, although
          older dates have been proposed for Laas Geel. This phase would be characterized
          by humpless cows, sheep and goats as well as wild animals. These sites would
          indicate the beginning of domestication in this region, the cattle being
          as a fundamental pillar of these communities. From this starting point the
          relative antiquity of the depictions would be marked by a tendency to schematism,
          visible in the superimpositions of several rock art sites. The introduction
          of camels would mark a chronology of the end of the first millennium BC,
          while the date proposed for the introduction of zebus (humped cows) should
          be placed at between the 1st Centuries BC and AD.

        body: Since the 1st millennium BC human figures armed with lances, bows and
          shields start to appear alongside the cattle, in some cases distributed
          in rows and depicting fighting scenes against other warriors or lions. The
          moment when this last period of rock art ended is unknown, but in nearby
          Eritrea some of these figures were depicted with firearms, thus implying
          that they could have reached a relatively modern date.

        body: The Kondoa rock art sites are located on the eastern slopes of the Maasai
          escarpment, which borders the western side of the Great Rift Valley in central
          Tanzania, covering an area of over 2,336 km². Stretching for around 18 km
          along the escarpment, the exact number of rock art sites in the Kondoa area
          is unknown but is estimated to be up to 450, the oldest of which are thought
          be more than 2,000 years old. The extensive and spectacular collection of
          rock paintings are attributable to both hunter-gatherer and pastoralist
          communities and the images are testament to the changing socio-economic
          environment in the region. The hunter-gatherer rock paintings of Kondoa
          are dominated by human figures and animals. While a dark reddish brown predominates,
          other colours include yellow, orange, red and white.  Some of the shelters
          are still considered to have cultural associations with the people who live
          nearby, reflecting their beliefs, rituals and cosmological traditions. In
          2006, Kondoa was nominated and listed as one of UNESCO’s World Heritage
          rock art sites in Africa.

        body: "The sites at Kolo are the most famous of the Kondoa paintings. Kolo
          comprises three rock art sites, known as Kolo 1, 2 and 3. The main site,
          Kolo 1 (known locally as Mongomi wa Kolo) is a large, imposing rock shelter
          that is only accessible by following a winding path at the end of a dirt
          road. This site contains many fine-line red paintings, some of which are
          very faded; but the site is still used by the local community for secret
          rituals. Kolo 2 is located south of the main site and includes human and
          animal figures, while Kolo 3 is north of Kolo1 and is characterised by human,
          animal and geometric figures. The renowned palaeontologist Mary Leakey surveyed
          and documented many of the paintings at Kolo in the 1950s.  The examples
          we see here are thought to have been made by early hunter-gatherer groups,
          ancestors of the modern Sandawe, one of the first cultural groups to inhabit
          Kondoa.   \n\n"

        body: "__Art__\n\nAmong the animals depicted are elephants, giraffes, antelopes,
          eland, rhinoceros and wildebeest; while human figures are represented as
          slender and elongated, often with elaborate hairstyles or headdresses, holding
          bows and arrows. Groups of figures are also shown bent at the waist, with
          some appearing to take on animal characteristics. These paintings have been
          associated with Sandawe cultural beliefs. \n\nThe Sandawe communicate with
          the spirits by taking on the power of an animal and some features at Mongomi
          wa Kolo can be understood by reference to the Sandawe traditional practice
          known as simbó (Ten Raa 1971, 1974). Developing Ten Raa’s observations,
          Lewis-Williams (1986) proposed that simbó is the ritual of being a lion,
          and that simbó dancers are believed to turn into lions. Lim (1992, 1996)
          adopted a site-specific approach to the rock art and has suggested that
          the importance of place is as important as the images themselves. According
          to Lim the potency of a place is produced through ritual activities, so
          that meaning resides in the process of painting in a particular location,
          rather than in the painted image itself.  \n"

          Ritual Practices

          Ritual sites are generally located near fig and baobab trees, and springs. However, about 3 m south of the main Kolo shelter, a cavity underneath a huge boulder is used, even today, by local diviners, healers and rainmakers to invoke visions and communicate with the spirits. Oral traditions indicate that Mongomi wa Kolo is considered more powerful than other ritual places in Kondoa, and its unusual location may contribute to its efficacy.  The other two shelters of Kolo 2 and 3 are also used for ritual ceremonies.

          __Conservation__

          When Mary Leakey was surveying the Kondoa rock paintings in 1983 she predicted that if serious preservation and conservation measures were not put in place the paintings would be destroyed by 2020. Although inscribed onto the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2006, it has been noted paintings are being destroyed by the dust from the ground and in some cases rainwater is causing the paintings to deteriorate.

          Moreover, the documentation of paintings at Kondoa is incomplete, and some areas have not been surveyed at all. Bwasiri (2008) advocates an urgent need to collate all existing information in this region and implement a sites and monuments record that also takes into account living heritage values.

          of which may date back 10,000 years. Consisting mainly of paintings, rock
          art is found predominantly in the Kondoa region and the adjoining Lake Eyasi
          basin. Those at Kondoa were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in

        body: |-
          Situated within the Great Lakes Region of East Africa, Tanzania is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and the Indian Ocean to the east, with a coastline of approx. 800km. At 947,303 km², Tanzania is the largest country in East Africa and is home to Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro (5,895 m, 19,340 feet), located in the north-east of the country.

          Central Tanzania is comprised largely of a plateau, which is mainly grassland and contains many national parks. The north of the country is predominantly arable and includes the national capital of Dodoma. The north-east of the country is mountainous and contains the eastern arm of the Great Rift Valley. Further north-west is Lake Victoria adjoining the Kenya–Uganda–Tanzania border. Concentrations of rock art are found mainly in the Kondoa province of central Tanzania and also the Lake Eyasi Basin in the north of the country.


          The rock art of the Lake Eyasi Basin and that of Kondoa share many similarities related to subject matter, styles, pigments and even types of sites. This may possibly reflect a shared art tradition among hunter-gatherers, which is feasible as there are no natural barriers preventing the movement of cultural ideas and techniques.

        title: History of rock art research in Tanzania
        title_internal: Tanzania Chapter 3
        body: 'The existence of painted rock art was first reported  to Europeans
          in 1908 by missionaries, but the first scientific explorations date back
          to the 1930s. Early surveys were undertaken by Ludwig Kohl-Larsen (1958),
          a German physician, amateur anthropologist and explorer, who traced images
          in more than 70 rock shelters in 1935. The renowned paleoanthropologists
          Mary and Louis Leakey (1983) were the first to extensively study the rock
          art of Tanzania during the 1930s and 1950s (having noted many sites in the
          1920s), documenting over 1600 painted images at 186 sites north of Kondoa.
          In the late 1970s and during the 1980s Fidelis Masao (1979) surveyed 68
          rock paintings sites and excavated four of them while Emmanuel Anati (1996)
          recorded 200 sites in Kondoa. Other researchers include Eric ten Raa (1971,
          1974), David Lewis-Williams (1986), Imogene Lim (1992), and Emmanuel Bwasiri
          (2008, 2011); all of whom have recorded numerous sites, contributing to
          identifying chronologies, styles and possible interpretations. Conservation
          and preservation of the rock art has been of importance since the 1930s,
          and many of the paintings recorded by the Leakeys in the early 1950s are
          now severely deteriorated, or in some cases completely destroyed. '

        title_internal: Tanzania Chapter 4
        body: "Scholars have classified the rock art in Tanzania into three main stylistic
          groups:  Hunter-gatherer, also known as Sandawe, Pastoral, and Late Whites.
          Hunter-gatherer and Late White paintings are often found in the same rock
          shelters and in some instances, all three types occur at the same site.
          \n\nNo paintings have been scientifically dated, but some researchers have
          proposed the earliest dates for the art: Anati (1996) has suggested paintings
          at Kondoa may be up to 40,000 years old; Leakey (1985) and Coulson and Campbell
          (2001) up to 10,000 years old. Masao (1979) has estimated the earliest art
          at perhaps 3000 years old. These are estimates and not based on radiometric
          dating techniques, and as the paintings have been exposed to considerable
          weathering these very early dates currently cannot be substantiated.\n\n__Hunter-gatherer__\n\nHunter-gatherer
          or Sandawe rock art is characterised by fine-line paintings and includes
          images of animals, human figures, handprints and circular designs. These
          are the earliest paintings, thought to date to between 3,000-10,000 years
          ago, and are attributed to the ancestral Sandawe, a hunter-gatherer group
          indigenous to north-east Tanzania. \n\nThis tradition of rock art occurs
          in the Kondoa region, with just a few hundred sites in a concentration of
          less than a 100km in diameter and corresponding closely to the known distribution
          of the Sandawe people. Animals, such as giraffe, elephant, rhinoceros, antelope,
          plus a few birds and reptiles, dogs and possibly bees, make up more than
          half of the images depicted. In addition there are a few animal tracks depicted:
          cloven hooves, porcupine and aardvark.  \n"

          Typically, human figures are slender and elongated, wearing large elaborate coiffures or headdresses, and sometimes with animal heads.  Occasionally they are bent at the waist but they always appear in groups or pairs. A few of the figures are painted with bows and arrows and occur with animals, although whether these represent a hunting scene is uncertain. Women are very scarce. The few handprints present are painted depictions rather than stencils and circular designs are made up of concentric circles sometimes with elaborate rays and occasional rectangles and finger dots.

          __Pastoral__

          About 3,000 years ago, Cushitic herders from Ethiopia moved into the region, and were followed by Nilotic cattle pastoralists, ancestors of today’s Maasai. In comparison to hunter-gatherer rock art, Pastoral rock art yields many fewer paintings and generally depicts cattle in profile, and sometimes sheep and/or goats, a few dogs and figures holding sticks and bows. Predominantly painted in black and sometimes red and white, the colour of many images has now faded to a dull grey colour.

          __Late White__

          Late White paintings are crude, finger painted images and often superimpose older images. These were made by Bantu-speaking, iron-working farmers who moved into the region in the last 300-500 years.  The most common type of depiction are designs and motifs that include circles, some of which have rays emanating outwards,  concentric circles, patterns of dots and grids with outlines, what look like stick figures with multiple arms, as well as handprints. Animal depictions include giraffe, elephant, antelope, snakes, reptiles, baboons and domestic species. Human figures are less common, but when present are notably men facing forwards with hands on hips, sometimes holding weapons.

          First documented in 1913 (in the Teso Report&dagger;), the geometric paintings at Nyero are among the most important and well documented rock art sites in Uganda, and are on the Tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage sites&Dagger;.

          Nyero is located in eastern Uganda in the Kumi District, about 200 km from the capital city Kampala.  It comprises six rock shelters in total, but initially only three were recorded and referred to as shrines by local communities, who had no knowledge of the origins of the paintings. The authorship of the paintings remains in some debate.

          Initially, the rock art was thought to be the work of San|Bushmen of southern Africa. However, archaeological, genetic and ethnographic evidence has subsequently attributed the paintings to the ancestors of Batwa people, hunter-gatherers who are descendants of ancient aboriginal groups once spread across East and Central Africa and most probably the original inhabitants of this landscape. Today they live in small groups near the Rwanda/Uganda border.

          More recent studies have proposed that the rock art was the work of settled human groups and not early hunter-gatherers. It has been proposed that rock shelters were used by semi-nomadic peoples devoted to animal herding, and used as reference points in the landscape. Generally positioned away from flat land, they may have served to direct herders of cattle and/or goats towards paths and water. The unknown identity of the rock artists makes dating problematic, but some of the paintings may be up to 12,000 years old.
          Notwithstanding the problems associated with attribution and chronology, many of the rock paintings in Uganda show serious damage due to long exposure to the elements. At Nyero 2, the paintings are partially covered with mineral salts, while at Nyero 5 the paintings have been destroyed or are obscured by rain wash-off. The physical condition of the paintings is testament to their antiquity.

          __Nyero Rock Art sites:__

          __Nyero 1__
          This is a small rock shelter on the outer edge of the outcrop and comprises six sets of concentric circles with a central image of a ‘floral motif’ and a so-called ‘acacia pod’ shape. The geometrics in this shelter are all painted in white.

          __Nyero 2__
          This is the main shelter, the overhang of which is formed by an enormous boulder (estimated to weigh at least 20,000 tons) which has broken away; a vertical rock against the back wall measures 10m in height. The panel at Nyero 2 consists of more than forty images such as vertical divided sausage shapes, so-called ‘canoes‘, unidentified faint markings, ‘U’ shapes, lines and dots, with evidence of superimposition; but is dominated by concentric circles. A unique feature of the paintings are the so-called ‘canoes’ or parts of ‘canoes’, so-called because of their resemblance in form. The depictions are all painted in shades of red.

          The paintings are protected from direct rain by the overhang and rocks to the front and sides protect the paintings from the sun, which is likely to have contributed to their preservation. Early users of the shelter placed ritual gifts on its south-eastern side; the tradition of using this space to place money either before or after receiving help from ancestral spirits is continued by the local community.
          As well as the rock art, a bone incised with three concentric circles and four parallel lines, and pieces of prepared ochre were excavated from this site in 1945.  These are the only evidence of prehistoric portable art so far found in Uganda.

          __Nyero 3__
          Located about eight minutes’ walk from Nyero 2, this shelter is formed by a large boulder perched on supporting rocks. Paintings consist of white concentric circles; the outer circles surrounded by double curved designs, between which are double lines divided into small compartments.

          This is a small shelter on the south-western side of the hill where there are a few traces of red finger-painted concentric circles, two conical shapes and lines.

          __Nyero 5__
          Situated on the western side of the hill, this shelter has a red geometric motif composed of a combination of circular and linear shapes made with both a brush and a finger. However, the images are quite difficult to distinguish as they are damaged by natural water erosion.

          __Nyero 6__
          Situated on the top of the hill, this shelter has a good view of the landscape. This site features two red finger-painted outlines of small oval shapes and a slanting L-shape as well as an outlined cross with a small circle below. The painted surface is now subject to severe exfoliation as it is open to the rain and morning sun.

          The sites at Nyero are believed locally to have been sacred ancestral places where, in the past, people would have travelled long distances to make offerings of food, beer and money in times of drought, misfortune and for child birth. Nyero was also regarded as a magical place where rain ceremonies were held. Oral histories have recorded strong attachments to the site and individual and community prayers were held seasonally. The antiquity of the images and their association with long-forgotten peoples may serve to enhance Nyero as a special and sacred place for local communities.

        body: Rock art in Uganda is mostly concentrated in the eastern part of the
          country, but more broadly sits within a regional belt of geometric rock
          art spanning East and Central Africa. It is mainly geometric in nature and
          includes both paintings (red and white being the most common pigment) and
          engravings; it comprises a basic and recurring repertoire of shapes including
          circular, rectangular, sausage, dot and lines. Concentric circles with rays
          emanating from them are a unique feature of Ugandan rock art.

          shares borders with Kenya to the east, South Sudan in the north, Democratic
          Republic of Congo in the west, and Rwanda and Tanzania in the south. It
          sits in the heart of the Great Lakes region, flanked by Lake Edward, Lake
          Albert and Lake Victoria, the latter being the second largest inland freshwater
          lake in the world, containing numerous islands. While much of its border
          is lakeshore, the country is landlocked.  Predominantly plateau, Uganda
          is cradled by mountains with Margherita peak (5,199m) on Mount Stanley the
          third highest point in Africa.

        body: |-
          The first documentation of rock art in Uganda occurred in 1913 (Teso Report) at Nyero, a painted rock shelter of the Later Iron Age period. After its initial recording the site was subsequently cited in a 1945 excavation report (Harwich, 1961) and meticulously noted by J.C.D Lawrance during the 1950s. Only a small number of studies of Ugandan rock art rock art have been published (Wayland 1938; Lawrance 1953; Posnansky 1961; Morton 1967; Chaplin 1974), with early analyses being predominantly descriptive and highly speculative.

          The first major publications on Ugandan rock art emerged in the 1960s (Posnansky 1961; Morton 1967; Chaplin 1974) with rock art researchers proposing that the geometric and non-representational depictions served a documentary purpose of identifying cultural groups such as hunter-gatherers, cultivators or pastoralists. During this decade researchers attempted to place the rock art in a chronological framework, tying it to broader archaeological sequences. Political instability greatly impeded research during the 1970s and 1980s, although Chaplin’s thesis and in-depth survey on prehistoric rock art of Lake Victoria was published posthumously in 1974.

          the assumption that the art was attributable to the so-called “Bushmen”
          of southern Africa, using these explanations to understand the rock art
          of Uganda. Catherine Namono’s (2010) recent doctoral thesis on rock art
          in Uganda has opened up these debates, “tackling the more slippery issues
          of attribution, interpretation and understanding of rock art” (Namono, 2010:40).

        body: |-
          Attempts to understand the chronology of Ugandan rock in the 1960s were based on sequences focusing on pigments used in paintings. Lawrance proposed that yellow paintings were the oldest; followed by orange, red, purple, red and white; white and dirty white were the latest in the sequence. It is highly problematic developing sequences based on pigments because of the ways in which they chemically react with particular surfaces, other pigments and the natural elements, which can compromise the integrity of the pigment. However, there appears to be a consistency (across East and Central Africa) that suggests red and white geometric paintings are the oldest and have been in existence for millennia.

          Initially thought to be the work of San Bushmen of southern Africa, archaeological, genetic and ethnographic evidence has subsequently attributed the paintings to the Batwa people, a cultural group who are today found in small groups near the Rwanda/Uganda border. If it is accepted that the geometric imagery was made by these hunter-gatherers then the rock art of Uganda probably dates from between 12,000 to 1,000 years ago.

        body: However, more recent studies have proposed that these were the work
          of settled human groups and not early hunter-gatherers. Radiocarbon dating
          at Nyero (and another site at Kakoro) has dated the paintings to between
          5,000 and 1,600 years ago. It has been proposed that rock shelters were
          used by semi-nomadic peoples engaged in animal herding, which they used
          as reference points in the landscape. Generally positioned away from flat
          land, they may have served to direct herders of cattle and/or goats towards
          paths and water.

        title: Interpretation
        title_internal: 'Uganda: country, chapter 11'
        body: A recent comprehensive study (Namono, 2010) of the potential meaning
          of geometric art in Uganda looked at the ways in which the geometric shapes
          in the rock art can be associated with the ethnographies of hunter-gatherers
          of the region. The approach proposed that the symbolism of geometric rock
          art derives from a gendered forest worldview. The forest is pivotal to hunter/gatherer
          cosmology in this region, whereby it plays a central role in cultural production
          and reproduction over time and is regarded as both male and female. The
          forest is not only a source of subsistence and well-being but informs their
          identity and the rock art reflects these complex concepts.

          in some cases, such as at Nyero, sites are still in use by local peoples
          with offerings being made and sites associated with rain-making rituals.
          However, the advent of colonialism influenced such traditions bringing a
          change in the way the forest was venerated, used and conceptualised.

        body: The paintings at Tsodilo are unique in comparison to other San|Bushmen
          rock art in both techniques and subject matter. San|Bushmen paintings are
          well-known throughout southern Africa for their fine-line detail because
          they were brush painted, but those at Tsodilo are finger painted. In addition,
          160 depictions of cattle are portrayed in the same style as wild animals,
          and more geometric designs appear here than anywhere else. Tsodilo animal
          drawings are larger and the geometric designs simpler than those found elsewhere.  In
          comparison to human figures elsewhere in southern Africa, those at Tsodilo
          appear without bows and arrows, clothing or any forms of personal ornamentation.  In
          addition, numerous cupules and grooves are incised and ground into rock
          surfaces, sometimes close to painted rock art sites and some on their own.
          For the residents of Tsodilo, the hills are a sacred place inhabited by
          spirits of the ancestors.

        body: While most of the images in the Tsodilo Hills seem to be discrete depictions,
          some sites show figures. Some of these figures are with cattle as well as
          women standing in rows in connection with animal groups, possibly showing
          some relationship with each other. Additionally, some of the rock art in
          the Tsodilo Hills shows superimposition, but this occurs infrequently. In
          some cases red geometric designs superimpose animals, but geometric designs
          and animals never superimpose human figures, nor do images of cattle ever
          superimpose other images – which may suggest some kind of relationship or
          hierarchy.

          eland, cows, antelope, snakes, unidentified animals and geometric designs,
          particularly “m” shapes. White paintings occur at sites with red paintings
          and often superimpose them.

        title: Cupules/Grooves
        title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 8'
        body: There are no engravings at Tsodilo representing animals or human figures,
          but more than 25 sites show evidence of small round depressions ground into
          the rock, known as cupules, as well as various shaped grooves that have
          been chipped and ground into the rock. The majority of sites are found on
          Female Hill, with four on Male Hill and one site on Child Hill. Cupules
          tend to measure about 5cm or more wide and less than a 1 cm deep, although
          larger examples occur. They can occur at painted rock art sites but also
          on their own. For the most part they are found in groups ranging from 5
          to 100 and in three cases, considerably more. For example, in Rhino Cave
          there are 346 carved into a vertical wall and nearly 1,100 at Depression
          Shelter. The purpose or meaning of cupules is unknown; they may have denoted
          a special place or the number of times a site had been visited. However,
          we have no dates for any of the cupules and even if they are adjacent to
          a rock art site, they are not necessarily contemporaneous. From their patina
          and general wear it has been proposed that some cupules may date back tens
          of thousands of years to the Middle Stone Age. If paintings also existed
          at this time they have long since disappeared.

        title: Who were the artists?
        title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 10'
        body: "It is a bit of a mystery about who actually created the paintings at
          Tsodilo, as the red images at Tsodilo do not fit neatly into other known
          styles of rock art in southern Africa. They do not show the fine brush work
          of San|Bushmen¹ in other parts of southern Africa, nor the cruder style
          of white paintings attributed to later Bantu-speaking farmers.\n\nIt is
          possible that they were painted by the Khoesan during the first millennium
          AD, the original settlers in the area who made stone tools and herded livestock.
          A local Ncaekhoe man (a Central San people) claims his ancestors made the
          paintings and it is possible that some or many of the cattle images were
          painted by pastoral ancestors of Ncaekhoe. \n\nThe white paintings are more
          difficult to attribute authorship, although as they are comparable to the
          red paintings, comprising the same subject matter of elephant, rhino, giraffe
          and antelope as well as geometrics, they may reflect a later version of
          the red tradition.\n\n"

        title: Dating
        title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 11'
        body: The paintings at Tsodilo are often faded because they are located on
          rock faces exposed to the sun, wind and rain. As such, dating them scientifically
          is problematic as little or no suitable organic material remains. However,
          cattle paintings may help to date the art. There are about 160 depictions
          of cattle, which were common around the Tsodilo Hills between 800–1200 AD.
          As the cattle depictions are stylistically similar to other animal depictions
          it has been suggested that this seems to be a plausible date for most of
          the art (Coulson and Campbell, 2001:103)

          between images on the same rock. \n\nRepresentations of people are simply
          painted and generally stick-like, identified to gender by either penis or
          breasts. In some cases this may represent sexual virility and fertility,
          although in scenes where both occur it may merely indicate gender differences.\n\nCattle
          seem to appear in the rock art at the same time as human figures. In one

          herding or stealing cattle (Campbell, Robbins and Taylor, 2010:106). Three

        body: The Republic of Botswana is bordered by South Africa to the south, Namibia
          to the west and north and Zimbabwe to the north-east. It shares a short
          border consisting of a few hundred metres with Zambia to the north. The
          majority of this flat country, around 70%, is made up of the Kalahari Desert,
          with the Okavango Delta, one of the world’s largest inland deltas located
          in the north. Botswana has a subtropical climate of hot summers and warm
          winters due to its high altitude and is semi-arid due to the short rainy
          season. Rock art is scattered across the country with the main sites being
          found in the Tsodilo Hills in the north- west;  the Gubatshaa Hills in the
          Chobe National Park, east of the Okavango Delta;  Tuli Block in the far
          east of the country and Manyana in the south-east.

          German geologist Siegfried Passarge visited the Tsodilo Hills on the 1st July 1898, mapping the area, writing on the geology and photographing a few rock paintings. In 1907, he published tracings of his photos in Die Buschmänner der Kalahari. A passing mention of the Hills was made in 1913 in a brief report by Max Happe, but it was François Balsan, a French industrialist and explorer, who raised the profile of Tsodilo Hills when over two days he photographed and prepared tracings of what has come to be known as the “Rhino Panel” on September 27-28 1951.

          Laurens van der Post’s publication of *The Lost World of the Kalahari* in 1958 brought Tsodilo Hills and its rock art to the attention of the wider world. Van der Post, an Afrikaner, had planned to make a film of the rock art in the region, but a number of events including the shooting of a steenbok (a severe crime locally), the cameras jamming and swarms of bees descending upon their camp, conspired against him and resulted in van der Post leaving the Hills in despair. However, he also left an apologetic note at the rock art panel he had been trying to film as a way of assuaging the wrath of the “Spirit of the Hills” as he put it. The rock face he was trying to film, comprising eland, giraffe and handprints, is now known as “Van der Post Panel”.

          In 1963 Alec Campbell visited the region with George Silberbauer, an ethnographer who had studied the San|Bushmen in Botswana. As Director of Botswana’s National Museum, Campbell had a little government funding to record the rock art and excavate the rock shelters. Subsequently he collaborated with archaeologists Larry Robbins, Mike Murphy, and paleo-geographer George Brook.

          During the 1990s, Campbell, along with the staff from the National Museum recorded around 400 rock art sites numbering over 4,000 individual paintings. In 2001 Tsodilo Hills became a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its spiritual significance to local peoples, as well as its unique record of human settlement over many millennia.

          Tuli Block is a narrow fringe of land in the far east of the country that borders South Africa and lies on the banks of the Limpopo River. This area is characterised by rock engravings of human and animal footprints, and cupules, which hold spiritual importance both for San|Bushman¹ hunter-gatherers and Tswana farmers. The engravings are thought to refer to a local myth that tells of an ancestor, named Matsieng, who is believed to have emerged from a waterhole followed by his animals. However, there are several localities in the region that claim this origin myth. It is thought the engravings in this area were created by the San|Bushmen and linked to their belief system, appropriated later by the Tswana farmers.

          The most renowned rock art in Botswana comes from the Tsodilo Hills in the north-west of the country. With more than 4,500 paintings preserved in an area of 10km² it has been termed the “Louvre of the Desert”.  Tsodilo is made up of four main hills; Male Hill, Female Hill, Child Hill and North Hill, and paintings occur on all four. The subject matter, comprised of red and white paintings, includes animals, human figures and geometric designs. Red paintings are likely to have been made by San|Bushmen, while the white paintings are more difficult to attribute authorship to but may be a later continuation of the red tradition. There are no engraved images at Tsodilo but cupules and ground grooves are a common feature.  Dating of the paintings at Tsodilo has been difficult, and because many of them occur on exposed surfaces where they are susceptible to damage by the sun, rain and wind, what remains is probably not very old. However, paintings of cattle, which are also badly faded, probably date to between AD 800 and 1150 when people kept these animals in this area.

          ¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

        body: 'Rock art is rare in the south-east of the country, but the site of
          Manyana is noteworthy because it is the only one that has been excavated.
          The paintings are found at five sites along a rock outcrop of 0.75 km at
          the base of the Koboleng Hills, and while once richly decorated, many of
          the paintings have now faded. It is difficult to determine exactly when
          the paintings were made, but excavation shows the use of ochre from the
          earliest occupation levels dating to the Late Stone Age, around AD 100 -
          800, with the latest occupation levels dating to the Late Iron Age, around
          AD 1600-1700. Interestingly, none of the paintings were done in white, a
          colour found at many other sites in Botswana and other regions of southern
          Africa, and often attributed to paintings of Iron Age date. In addition,
          there are no images of eland or figures combining human/antelope form which
          are common occurrences in South African rock art. '

          also in the eastern part of the country in Tuli Block and Gubatshaa Hills.
          Engravings include human footprints and animal tracks. Most sites with engravings
          and/or cupules occur near water; for example at the site of Riverslee in
          the Tuli Block they encircle a waterhole while at Basinghall the cupule
          site is near the Limpopo River.

        body: Because the identity of the artists are unknown to us we can only speculate
          on the function and/or meanings of the art in relation to other rock art
          traditions in southern Africa.  These may include fertility, health, abundance,
          protection against evil spirits or summoning rain. Contemporary communities
          at Tsodilo Hills believe that spirits live in the Hills and have explained
          how those who enter the Hills must be respectful as the spirits are capable
          of both curing and punishing people. In particular, White Paintings Shelter
          in the Tsodilo Hills was used as a place to perform curative dances that
          involved the placing of hands on the paintings in order to use its power.
          Geometric designs are more difficult to interpret but may fit into a tradition
          of other geometric symbols in the region and represent weather and fertility
          symbols.

          the north-west of central Namibia, forms the largest single grouping of
          ancient engraved images in southern Africa.  Covering about 57 hectares
          in the core area and home to over 2,000 engravings, the rock art sites are
          situated near a small but permanent spring. The site was first formally
          noted by Reinhard Maack in a 1921 report to the Administrator of South West
          Africa, following a report to him from a surveyor named Volkmann mentioning
          the engravings, near a spring Volkmann named as Uais (/Ui-//aes= place among
          rocks or jumping waterhole in Khoekhoegowab, the language of the local Damara
          people).  Later, the land came into the use of farmer David Levin, whose
          concern over the survival of the spring led ultimately to its being referred
          to as Twyfelfontein (‘doubtful spring’ in Afrikaans). In 1963 Ernst Scherz
          visited the site as part of his work to record rock art sites throughout
          South West Africa.  Scherz documented around 2,500 images in the wider valley
          area, while a 2005 survey of the core site found 2,075 individual images
          on 235 separate rock surfaces.  '

          of cross-hatched, looped and linear forms, as well as circles and polished
          depressions and cupules.  In addition there are numerous depictions of animals,
          ranging in style from more naturalistic to stylised and distorted.  Chief
          among the animal images is the giraffe, which is most numerous.  Also common
          are images of rhinoceroses, zebra, gemsbok antelope and ostriches.  There
          are occasional depictions of cattle but images of human beings are almost
          absent.  Also featured are images of human footprints and animal spoor (hoof

        body: The figurative images in the engraved art feature several different
          distinct styles, ranging from very naturalistic outlines of animals such
          as giraffes and rhinoceroses, through carefully delineated but stylised
          or distorted renditions of these animals with exaggerated extremities, to
          very schematic pecked outlines.  One particular aspect of style is a form
          of relief engraving, whereby in some deeply pecked figures' muscle masses
          are delineated.  In others, the infill pecking is graded and  sparser in
          the centre of a figure, giving the impression of shading.  A few of the
          engravings are highly polished.  Perhaps most renowned among these is the
          “dancing kudu” image, a stylised image of a kudu antelope cow rendered atop
          a flat slab of rock and surrounded by geometric shapes.

        body: "It appears that the kudu figure is pregnant and it has been suggested
          that the choice of this animal may have been made in relation to female
          initiation practices. This is because the female kudu has a symbolic importance
          relating to women’s behaviour in the cosmology of some San|Bushman¹ people,
          traditionally hunter-gatherer people whose ancestors are thought to have
          made most of southern Africa’s rock paintings and engravings.  Other animals
          known to have symbolic and metaphorical significance to San|Bushman people
          are also depicted here (giraffe images are most numerous) and these images
          have been interpreted in the vein of other southern African rock art sites,
          where images are thought to reflect the experiences of shamans while in
          a trance state, and may have multiple metaphorical and other cultural meanings.
          \ \n\nThe engravings were certainly made in strategic locations and not
          simply on any available rock surface, with some images having been deliberately
          made in places that are difficult to reach and to see.  The reason for this
          is unclear, though it has been suggested that such placement might be in
          relation to the images serving a preparatory function for shamans preparing
          to enter a trance.  Some of the engravings have exaggerated features such
          as elongated limbs and extremities which may reflect trance experience.
          \ One of the engravings appears to depict a lion with pugmarks (paw prints)
          instead of feet and third at the end of the tail.  Each of those in the
          feet have five instead of the correct four pads and this has been interpreted
          as meaning that the figure represents a human shaman in trance who has taken
          on lion form.  A similar suggestion has been made regarding the frequent
          depictions of ostriches (Kinahan, 2006).  \n\n¹ San|Bushmen is a collective
          term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living
          in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions. Both
          'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these
          groups, although others have positively adopted them.\n"

        body: "Such interpretations are made on the basis that the artists followed
          the same cultural tradition as the ancestral San|Bushman. The few examples
          of painted rock art at the site certainly appear to conform to the hunter-gatherer
          tradition found elsewhere in Namibia.   Following this approach, the geometric
          engraved forms may be interpreted as illustrative of so-called ‘entoptic’
          phenomena: shapes and patterns observed when entering a trance state, though
          an alternative origin for some of the geometrics with particular line and
          circle motifs has also been suggested. This proposal suggests that they
          were made by ancestral Khoenkhoen herder people, rather than hunter-gatherers,
          perhaps in relation to initiation practices.  \n\nAttempting to date or
          sequence the images based on superimpositioning or patina is difficult –
          superimposition of engravings at the site is rare and a range of patination
          colours seem to indicate these works having been created over a wide timescale,
          though it has been noted that a certain style of spoor images sometimes
          overlie some of the animal figures, indicating that this is a younger tradition.
          \ Archaeological fieldwork around the site undertaken in 1968 by Erich Wendt
          recovered evidence of occupation including stone tools, worked ostrich eggshell
          and stone structures.  The dates recovered from radiocarbon dating ranged
          widely from c.5,850-180 BP (years before present).  The relationship between
          periods of occupation/site use and the production of rock art is not known,
          but based on archaeological evidence from around the wider area it is thought
          that engravings in the styles found at Twyfelfontein range from around 6,000
          to around 1,000 years old, though some may be more recent.\n"

        body: "Rock art is found across the country from the southern border almost
          to the northern border, although rock art sites are scarce in the far north.
          \ The majority of known rock art sites are found in the rocky and mountainous
          areas forming the escarpment edge in the west of the country.  Particular
          concentrations of rock art are found in the west-centre of the country,
          north of the edge of the Namib’s coastal sand sea.  Namibia’s most well-known
          rock art locales are clustered in this area, among them the Brandberg (also
          known as Dâures) and Erongo mountains and the Spitzkoppe peaks, as well
          as the well-known engraved rock art complex at  Twyfelfontein | /Ui-//aes.
          \ \n\nAround  20km wide, the almost circular granitic intrusion of the Brandberg
          contains Namibia’s highest point  at over 2,500 ft., and around 1,000 rock
          art sites, with around 50,000 individual figures recorded. These include
          both paintings and engravings but paintings form the majority. The Erongo
          mountains, a similar but less compact formation around 120km to the south-east,
          contain a further 80 sites and 50km to the west of this, the Spitzkoppe
          peaks, a group of granite inselbergs, has a smaller concentration of known
          sites with 37 so far recorded.  Painting sites are most often found on vertical
          surfaces in rock shelters or the sides of granitic boulders,  while engravings
          may survive in more exposed environments such as on boulders, often dolerite
          or sandstone.   \n\nThe most well-known of the engraving sites is that of
          Twyfelfontein | /Ui-//aes, around 50 km north of the Brandberg. The rock
          art complex here is dominated by collections of engraved images, though
          some paintings are also present.  With well over 2,000 individual images,
          the Twyfelfontein engravings form the largest known discrete collection
          of engraved rock art in Southern Africa.   \n"

        body: 'The first published mention of rock art in south-western Africa may
          be that of C. J. Andersson who mentioned “A strange tale of a rock in which
          the tracks of …animals are distinctly visible” in his 1856 book Lake Ngami.  Further
          reports came in the 1870s when the Reverend C. J. Büttner published an article
          in a South African periodical reporting rock art in the Erongo Mountains,
          while Commissioner William Coates Palgrave made a report of paintings near
          Dassiesfontein, along with some the earliest known photographs of rock art
          in Africa.  European public awareness of rock art from the region in Europe
          was spurred by the January 1910 publication of an article  by Oberleutnant
          Hugo Jochmann featuring images from various sites in a German magazine.  The  first
          monograph on the rock art of the area then known as South West Africa was
          published in 1930 (Obermaier & Kühn, 1930), following further reports by
          officials, including the explorer and geographer Reinhardt Maack, who in
          a 1921 report first noted the existence of engravings at Twyfelfontein.  '

        body: "During the course of an earlier expedition, Maack had stumbled upon
          a singular painting in a Brandberg rock shelter. This image came to be well-known
          as the ‘White Lady’ of the Brandberg, after the renowned rock art researcher
          the Abbé Henri Breuil, who saw Maack’s copy of it and took a keen interest
          in the image. Eventually Breuil published a lavishly illustrated volume
          on the White Lady in 1955, which made it one of the most famous rock painting
          images in the world.  During the 1940s and 50s Breuil also explored and
          published on rock art sites elsewhere in the Brandberg and Erongo mountains.
          \ \n\nErnst Scherz, who had acted as a guide for Breuil, would go on to
          conduct extensive documentation work throughout the country as part of  the
          comprehensive research project investigating the archaeology of South West
          Africa run by the University of Cologne and sponsored by the Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft.
          \ Beginning in 1963, this resulted in the publications of Scherz’s three-volume
          opus *Felsbilder in Sudwest-Afrika* in 1970, 1975 and 1986, containing site
          by site descriptions and classifications of painting and engraving sites
          throughout modern Namibia, along with discussion of theme and context.  The
          Cologne programme also supported the work of several other researchers,
          including the designer and artist Harald Pager, whose meticulous work recording
          rock paintings in South Africa’s Drakensberg had already gained him recognition
          in the field of rock art research. From 1977, Pager began a seven year project
          of recording painted rock art sites in the Brandberg, documenting around
          43,000 individual images.  Pager’s corpus has been organised by Tilman Lenssen-Erz
          and published posthumously in the six-volume   *Rock Paintings of the Upper
          Brandberg*, as a result of which the Brandberg is one of the most comprehensively
          documented rock art regions on earth.\n"

        title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 8'
        body: "Much of the painted rock art in Namibia may be broadly compared to
          the wider hunter-gatherer rock art oeuvre found throughout southern Africa,
          similar in theme and composition and believed to be a part of the same general
          tradition, which is generally attributed to San|Bushman¹ people and their
          ancestors.  Imagery includes scenes of human figures carrying bows and other
          implements, wild animals and unidentified shapes in different pigments.
          \ Overall, human figures dominate in the paintings of Namibia, making up
          more than 2/3 of the painted figures, and where the gender can be recognised,
          they are more commonly male than female.  Prominent painting subjects and
          styles in the rock art of Namibia (particularly the best-studied west-central
          region) include, at some sites, clearly delineated dots and patterns on
          human figures, a particular tradition of showing human figures with voluminous
          decorated hairstyles, and more images of giraffe and kudu, gemsbok and springbok
          antelope than in other southern African regions.  Other images of animals
          include those of zebras, elephants, rhinoceros and ostriches.  More occasional
          motifs found include plants, cattle, sheep and handprints. \n\n¹ San|Bushmen
          is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher
          groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural
          traditions. Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some
          members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them."

          naturalistic to stylised.  Paintings found at Spitzkoppe tend to be smaller
          and cruder than others in the region, where some sites feature tableaux
          in many colours while others are entirely monochrome.   While the majority
          of rock  paintings in Namibia seem to conform to the hunter-gatherer style,
          there are also some examples of finger paintings in the Brandberg and northern
          Namibia, which are much more schematic in style and appear to belong to
          a different tradition altogether.  \n\nAs with much southern African rock
          art, the colours visible today may not always accurately reflect the original
          look as some pigments.  This is particularly true for those used for pale
          colours or white, which may be ‘fugitive’, meaning that over time they fade
          or wash away faster than the more stable pigments around them, leaving gaps
          which were once coloured.  Chemical analyses have shown that a major binder
          (used to coalesce dry pigment powder) for painted rock art in Namibia was
          blood, and in some cases egg white.   \n"

        title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 11'
        body: "Namibian rock paintings, and most engravings, have largely been interpreted
          in the vein largely espoused by  researchers over the past 30 years.  This
          postulates that much of this rock art reflects the experience of San|Bushman
          shamans entering trance states and that rather than being scenes from daily
          life, the depictions of animals and activities are highly symbolic within
          San|Bushman cosmology, with images acting as reservoirs of spiritual power.
          \ This avenue of interpretation originates largely from the study of rock
          art in South Africa and Lesotho.  While it appears broadly applicable here,
          the fact that direct attributions to known cultural groups in this area
          are difficult somewhat hinders direct comparisons with Namibian rock art.
          \ While hunter-gatherer rock painting production in South Africa was practiced
          until the recent past, it appears to have ceased in Namibia around a thousand
          \ years ago and modern San|Bushman groups in the Kalahari area have no tradition
          of rock art production.   \n\nAdditionally, hundreds of miles and different
          geographical environments separate the rock art centres of north-western
          Namibia from those in neighbouring countries. This is particularly apparent
          in the differences in terms of animal subject matter, with the numerous
          depictions of gemsbok and springbok, explicable by the rock art creators
          being semi-desert dwellers where gemsbok and springbok are found locally
          though largely absent from rock art elsewhere in southern Africa, where
          these animals are not found. \n"

        body: "Other differences are found in style and emphasis: the frequency with
          which giraffe feature in Namibian paintings and engravings contrasts with
          the South African rock art, where the emphasis is more on the eland antelope.
          \ This has led some to propose that the giraffe, similarly, must have held
          a particular symbolic meaning for the painters of the region.  Based on
          associated imagery, placement of the rock art sites, and some ethnography
          (written records of insights from contemporary San|Bushman culture compiled
          by anthropologists) it has been suggested that giraffes may have been linked
          with rain in local belief systems, with some Namibian rock painting sites
          are associated specifically with rainmaking or healing activities. \n\nWhile
          the more naturalistic examples of engravings are thought to have also been
          produced by ancient hunter-gatherers, as with the paintings, it has been
          suggested that some geometric engravings were produced  by herding people,
          possibly ancestral Khoenkhoen, perhaps in relation to initiation rites.
          \ Schematic finger paintings have also been attributed to pastoralist people.
          \ All attributions are tentative, however, because the majority of the art
          is thought to be many hundreds of years old and the historical distinctions
          between hunter-gatherers and herders is by no means clear-cut in the archaeological
          record.\n"

        body: "The pieces from the cave Wendt excavated (named ‘Apollo 11 Cave’ after
          the moon mission which took place during the period of the excavation work)
          are not thought to have fallen from a cave wall but were made on loose rock
          pieces.  The only parietal art (on a fixed rock surface) dated from excavated
          deposits in Namiba so far consists of pieces of painted granite from the
          largest painted shelter in the Brandberg, one of which, found in a sedimentary
          layer radiocarbon dated to around 2,700 years ago, had clearly fallen from
          an exposed rock surface into which researchers were able to refit it. Aside
          from this, estimates at the age of rock art are based on superimposition,
          patination and associated archaeological finds. \n\nBased on archaeological
          evidence, it is thought that the majority of the fine-line hunter-gatherer
          rock art in the Brandberg area was produced between around 4,000 and 2,000
          years ago, with the painting tradition in the wider region starting as much
          as 6,000 years ago. This ceased sometime after the introduction of small
          domestic stock to the area, although not immediately, as fine-line paintings
          of sheep and paintings and engravings of cattle testify.   Across central
          Namibia, there appears to be a particularly strong correspondence of finds
          relating to paintings—such as grinding equipment and pigments—with dated
          layers from the 1st millennium BC.\n"

        body: 'Engravings are more difficult to obtain dates for scientifically. Superimpositioning
          and other physical factors can serve to indicate which styles of image are
          more recent with both paintings and engravings. For example, in the Brandberg,
          monochrome tableaux appear older than detailed polychrome depictions of
          individuals, and certain images, such as those of zebras, are thought to
          be relatively late.  Among engravings of central Namibia, a certain style
          of hoof print appears to overlie some figurative images, leading researchers
          to believe them younger.  Overall it is thought that the engraving and painting
          traditions were concurrent, with some clear parallels in style, but that
          engraving probably lasted for several hundred years as a tradition after
          painting ceased.  '

          Africa. Situated in the foothills of the Drakensberg mountains, a sandstone
          recess atop a steep slope contains rock paintings made by people from the
          San|Bushman¹ communities who historically lived as hunter-gatherers throughout
          southern Africa. The Drakensberg mountains in particular are known for their
          wealth of rock paintings, often showing detailed and brightly coloured images
          of people, animals and part-human, part-animal figures known as ‘therianthropes’,
          with this site a prime example. One of the panels of paintings here is particularly
          important in the history of rock art research, as in the 1970s it helped
          to inspire a new kind of approach to the understanding of the meanings and
          symbolism of San|Bushman paintings and engravings.\n\n"

        body: The most prominent painting panel at Game Pass shows a series of carefully
          depicted eland antelope in delicately shaded red, brown and white pigment,
          largely super-imposing a group of ambiguous anthropomorphic figures wrapped
          in what appear to be bell-shaped karosses (traditional skin cloaks). Several
          small human figures appear to be running above them. These are some of the
          best-preserved rock paintings in the Drakensberg, with the largest animals
          around 30 cm long.  To the left of this panel are two smaller sets of images,
          one with two further eland, some further human-like figures and a human
          figure with a bow; the other (Fig. 1 below) a small panel, for which the
          site is most renowned.   An image around 50 cm long  shows an eland with
          its face turned towards the viewer, depicted as if stumbling forwards, with
          its hind legs crossed.  Grasping the eland's tail is a therianthrope figure
          with hooves for feet. Like the eland, this figure has its legs crossed and
          is depicted with small lines like raised hairs bristling from its body.
          To the right are three further therianthrope figures.

        body: The rock paintings from this site were first brought to public attention
          in a 1915 issue of Scientific American, and it has been frequently published
          on and discussed through the 20th century.  While studying a reproduction
          of the image with the stumbling eland in the early 1970s, researcher David
          Lewis-Williams began to consider that the figure holding the eland's tail
          (Fig. 2 below) might not be a simple illustration of a man wearing a skin
          suit, or performing an act of bravura, as had been suggested by previous
          researchers, but might be “idiomatic and metaphorical, rather than illustrative”
          (Lewis-Williams 1981:91).

        body: "This idea was partly inspired by the testimony of Qing, a San|Bushman
          man who, in 1873, had guided the Colonial Administrator Joseph Millerd Orpen
          to rock art sites in the mountains of Lesotho, with which the Drakensberg
          forms a natural eastern border with South Africa and which also contains
          many rock paintings. Qing's explanations of the paintings, some of which
          Orpen copied, included a reference to antelope-headed human figures having
          “died and gone to live in rivers, who were spoilt at the same time as the
          elands and… by the dances of which you have seen paintings”. This, along
          with testimony and practices recorded from other South African San|Bushman
          people at the time, as well as those living elsewhere in south-western Africa
          in the 20th century, suggested to Lewis-Williams that these and other images
          in San|Bushman rock art may be a reference to the activities of spiritual
          leaders or 'shamans', people who, in San|Bushman communities, are believed
          to have the power to interact with spirits and the spirit world in ways
          which may affect the physical world. \n\nLewis-Williams and other proponents
          of this 'shamanistic' approach to interpreting San|Bushman rock art have
          proposed that much of its imagery is in fact related to the shaman's experience
          during the 'trance dance' ritual found in all San|Bushman socie-ties. During
          this activity the shaman enters a hallucinatory state in which spiritual
          ‘tasks’ such as healing the sick may be undertaken on behalf of the community.
          On entering the trance state the shaman experiences trembling, sweating,
          stumbling and other symptoms similar to those of a dying antelope hit by
          a poisoned arrow. Lewis Williams noted that among some San|Bushman people
          this process is referred to as ‘dying’ or being ‘spoilt’ and considered
          that the similarities between the eland and the therianthrope figure in
          this image represent this conceived equivalence.\n\n"

          Despite the historical presence of other large game animals in the Drakensberg, the eland is the most commonly depicted animal in rock art of the region. Patricia Vinnicombe, noting this and the focus on other particular subjects in the imagery at the expense of others, proposed in her pioneering 1976 study of the rock art of the Southern Drakensberg *People of the Eland* that the paintings are “not a realistic reflection of the daily pursuits or environment of the Bushmen” (Vinnicombe 1976:347). Vinnicombe recalled that when, in the 1930s, an old Sotho man named Mapote, who had San|Bushman half-siblings and had used to paint with them, was requested to demonstrate, he had said that since the San|Bushmen had been “of the eland”, he should first depict an eland. Based on this and recountings of a myth about the creation and death of the first eland from Qing and other contemporary Southern San|Bushman people, Vinnicombe concluded that the eland, although regularly hunted by the Drakensberg San|Bushmen, had been a particularly sacred or powerful animal to them and that “Through the act of painting and re-painting the eland… the mental conflict involved in destroying a creature that was prized and loved by their deity…was…ritually symbolised and resolved” (Vinnicombe, 1976:350).

          Building on the idea of the spiritual significance of the eland, the approach proposed by Lewis-Williams offered an alternative interpretation by inferring from ethnography that eland were believed to have spiritual ‘potency’. As part of a complex system of beliefs involving conceptions of power and potency in relation to animals and rites, this potency could be released upon death, with trancing shamans believed to be able to harness it, feeling themselves taking on the attributes of the animal. Thus therianthrope figures like those depicted here may be interpreted as representing hallucinatory experiences of shamans in trance, where they may feel that they are assuming the forms of other animals. It has been argued that other motifs such as geometric forms known as 'entoptics' represent the abstract patterns created by neural networks and ‘seen’ during the early stages of entering an altered state of consciousness and that the paintings themselves may have been created as reservoirs of spiritual potency.

        body: "The shamanistic approach to interpreting San|Bushman rock art images,
          for which the Game Pass panel is sometimes referred to as the ‘Rosetta Stone’,
          gained popularity in the 1980s and has since become the dominant interpretative
          framework for researchers. Debate continues about the extent and nature
          of its applicability in all of San|Bushman rock art, and the extent to which
          myth and ritual not associated with the trance dance may also inform the
          art. Work that connects San|Bushman cosmology and practice with images from
          sites like Game Pass continue to provide interesting insights into these
          enigmatic images. \n\nGame Pass Shelter and many other rock art sites are

          The rock art of South Africa has probably been studied more extensively than that of any other African country.  It is estimated that South Africa contains many thousands of rock art sites, with a great variety of styles and techniques.  The most well-known rock art in South Africa is that created by the San|Bushman¹ people (several culturally linked groups of indigenous people of southern Africa who were traditionally hunter-gatherers) and their ancestors, with the painted rock shelters of the Drakensberg mountains some of the most well-known rock art sites in the world.  However, the range of South African rock art is wide, spanning great distances, many centuries, and different cultural traditions.

          ¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

        title: Geography and rock art distribution
        title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 2'
        body: South Africa covers around 1,213,090 km², encircling Lesotho and bordered
          in the north by Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe and in the west by Mozambique
          and Swaziland.  Much of the interior of the country consists of a high central
          plateau bordered by the Great Escarpment, a rocky ridge which forms the
          bulk of the long Drakensberg mountain system in the east and several smaller
          ranges in the centre and west of the country, as well as the western border
          with Lesotho.  Further to the south, the Cape Fold Mountains mirror the
          bend of the cape coast.  Much of South Africa’s known engraved rock art
          is found on igneous or metamorphic formations in the semi-arid environments
          of the central plateau.  In contrast, painted rock art sites are more commonly
          located in the sandstone and quartzite rock shelters of the mountain systems,
          which form the edges of the more temperate, low-lying coastal regions in
          the east and south of the country.

        title: Hunter-gatherer rock art
        title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 3'
        body: Much of both the painted and engraved rock art of South Africa is characterised
          by its naturalistic depictions of animals, as well as numerous images of
          people, ambiguous figures with mixtures of animal and human features, and
          certain ‘geometric’ or abstract shapes and patterns.  These images are the
          work of San|Bushman people and their ancestors.  Although San|Bushman communities
          now live mainly in Namibia, Botswana and north-western South Africa, historically
          San|Bushman cultural groups lived more widely throughout southern Africa.  Hunter-gatherer
          people are thought to have been the only inhabitants of what is now South
          Africa until the arrival of herding and farming people from the north from
          around 2,000 years ago.

        title: Herder rock art and other traditions
        title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 5'
        body: Some rock art styles and motifs elsewhere in South Africa seem to belong
          to other unique traditions.  It has been proposed that engraved rock art
          patterns with particular features including circular, linear and oblong
          motifs found at sites across the country, particularly near watercourses,
          may be the work of the Khoekhoen people or their ancestors, herders culturally
          related to the San|Bushmen. Some paintings also appear to reflect this tradition.
          Local rock art traditions specific to certain areas include, among others,
          conglomerations of handprints near the coast in the south-western part of
          the Western Cape and rows of engraved cupules in the north east of the country.
          There are also several examples from different rock art traditions across
          South Africa, of depictions of European people, items or events (such as
          horses and firearms) which clearly date from the 17th century or later.  In
          the Karoo region, rock gongs (natural rock formations with indentations
          indicating that they have been used as percussive instruments) are sometimes
          associated with engraving sites.

          paintings near the Great Fish River in the Eastern Cape.  Further written
          references to rock art from the area were made throughout the 18th and 19th
          centuries, with some of the earliest known reproductions of Southern African
          rock art made in the 1770s. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, painted
          copies were made of San|Bushman rock art by amateur artists such as George
          Stow, Mark and Graham Hutchinson and Helen Tongue. '

        body: In 1976, Vinnicombe published the seminal work *"People of the Eland"*,
          analysing paintings from 150 Drakensberg sites and attempting to gain insight
          into their execution and significance through a combination of quantitative
          study and reference to San|Bushman ethnography (written records of insights
          from San|Bushman culture compiled by anthropologists).  Through the 1980s,
          interpretation of rock art was further developed, perhaps most significantly
          by David Lewis-Williams, a collaborator of Vinnicombe's. Lewis-Williams
          originated an approach to understanding San|Bushman rock art which posits
          that the motivation and meaning for most, if not all, San|Bushman rock art
          is based on the centrality of the spiritual leader or'shaman' and the shaman’s
          actions in San|Bushman life and belief.  Over the past 30 years, the idea
          that much of San|Bushman rock art is essentially ‘shamanistic’ in nature
          has been dominant in academic discourse.

        title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 9'
        body: "Shamanistic interpretations of San|Bushman paintings and engravings
          draw on both past records of ‘Southern’ or /Xam San|Bushman people living
          historically in South Africa and more recent ethnography based mainly on
          San|Bushman communities in Namibia and Botswana, suggesting that their imagery
          illustrated and reinforced the power of the actions of shamans. Much of
          the imagery is proposed to reflect the shaman’s hallucinatory visions from
          the 'trance dance’, a tradition common to San|Bushman groups where shamans
          enter a trance state during which they visit a 'spirit world' in which they
          may go on spiritual journeys or perform tasks on behalf of their communities.
          It is thought that the rock art panels may have acted as reservoirs for
          the 'potency' that shamans are considered to possess, with the rock face
          considered a veil between both worlds.  The images are thought to reflect
          trance experiences including those of 'therianthropes’, images of figures
          with both human and animal features, explained as shamans who in a trance
          state feel themselves transformed into animals.  Certain other poses and
          features found in San|Bushman rock art, such as so-called 'entoptic' motifs—geometric
          shapes such as zigzags and dots—have also been interpreted as reflecting
          visions that shamans experience while in a trance state.  \n\nDiscussion
          continues around the extent of the applicability of 'shamanist' interpretations
          for all aspects of San|Bushman art, with research ongoing and scholars also
          exploring the potential roles of other elements in rock art production,
          such as mythology or gender and initiation rites.  Other avenues of study
          include more regional foci, on specific cultural and temporal contexts and
          how the imagery may reflect local power dynamics through time.\n"

        body: 'Although the focus in South African rock art research has been on San|Bushman
          art, research has also been done on other rock art traditions, suggesting
          different cultural origins.  For example, investigation of Northern Sotho
          rock art has shown much of it to have been created in relation to boys''and
          girls'' initiation ceremonies, while Bantu-language speakers''engravings
          of interlinked circle patterns have been interpreted as images of idealised
          conceptualised homesteads.  Work on attribution for some rock art of uncertain
          authorship also has been undertaken.  Certain geometric forms of rock engraving
          may be of Khoekhoen origin, possibly showing influence from central African
          geometric traditions and tracing historical migrations southwards.  It has
          also been suggested that some finger-painted images in the centre of the
          country are the early 19th century work of the Korana people, a group of
          mixed ancestry living as raiders on the Cape frontier and incorporating
          motifs from San|Bushman and other traditions. '

        title: Chronology
        title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 11'
        body: "The earliest scientifically dated examples of clearly visible painted
          parietal art in South Africa comes from Steenbokfontein Cave in the Western
          Cape, where collapsed painted portions from the wall buried in sediment
          have been radiocarbon dated to at least 3,600 years ago, while in the Drakensberg,
          AMS dating carried out on the oxalate crust superimposing a painting of
          a human figure has suggested it to be at least 1,800 years old.  While it
          is thought that the beginnings of the painting tradition in the Drakensberg
          region are probably older than this, the relative lack of durability in
          paint means that many of the existing paintings were probably made sometime
          within the past few hundred years. Sometimes it is apparent when this is
          the case - several painting sites in this region show images of both San|Bushman
          people and Europeans riding horses and bearing firearms, which dates them
          to within the past 350 years and particularly the 19th century.  Images
          of sheep and cattle also place images within the last 2,000 years.  \n\nThe
          oldest reliably dated evidence for deliberate engraving in the country is
          several ochre pieces incised with abstract patterns found in a buried layer
          in Blombos cave in the Western Cape and dated through a number of methods
          to between 70 and 100,000 years ago.  The earliest known figurative engraving
          date from the country comes from a slab with an image of a portion of an
          animal on it, excavated from Wonderwerk Cave in the Northern Cape and dating
          from around 10,200 years ago.  Engravings remaining in the open are more
          difficult to date scientifically, and various attempts have been made to
          date and sequence both engravings and paintings based on style and superimposition,
          while recent years, work has been undertaken to apply the Harris Matrix
          (an archaeological sequencing technique for relative dating) method to painting
          chronologies in the Free State, Drakensberg and Western Cape.  This involves
          using techniques originally conceived for charting chronology in stratigraphic
          layering to compare and sequence different superimposed motifs.\n"

          characterized by granite hills separated by nearly parallel valleys where
          the vegetation consists of scattered woodlands and areas covered by grass
          with an abundance of wild fruits. The region was occupied since at least
          the Middle Stone Age, but the human presence increased in the last millennia
          BC. The region holds an incredible amount of rock art; as many as 3,000
          sites have been estimated based on the better surveyed areas. Paintings
          constitute the vast majority of depictions, although occasional engravings
          have also been reported. Paintings are usually found in rock shelters and

          Zimbabwe, mainly consisting of depictions of animals and human figures often
          grouped in complex scenes, clustered or represented in rows. Human figures
          are predominant, with males being more numerous than women and children
          very rare. They are usually depicted in a slender style, facing left or
          right but with the upper part of the body facing front, and often carrying
          bows, arrows or other objects. Regarding the animals, mammals dominate,
          with the kudu antelope being especially numerous although this animal is
          not commonly found in the Matobo Hills. A wide range of animals such as
          smaller antelopes, giraffes, zebras, ostriches, monkeys, eland antelope,
          rhinoceros and to a lesser extent carnivores are also depicted. The animals
          are represented in very different attitudes and may be depicted standing
          still, running or lying. Humans and animals are often related in hunting
          scenes. Along with animals and human figures, a fair number of geometric
          symbols are present, including a very characteristic type of motif made
          of a series of narrow oval-like shapes (formlings) usually depicted vertically,

        body: "Many of the depictions in the Matobo Hills are associated with hunter-gatherers,
          providing a great amount of information about the social, economic and spiritual
          life of these groups. Depictions of daily objects (bows, vessels, digging
          sticks, cloaks) appear depicted in the rock art, and humans are shown hunting
          animals, fighting other groups and dancing in what seem to be ritual scenes.
          In fact, many of the scenes show strong similarities to those found in the
          Drakensberg (South Africa), and part of the iconography in the Zimbabwean
          paintings – ‘therianthropes’ (part-human, part-animal figures), elongated
          figures, rain animals, geometric figures – can be easily related to trance
          or rain-making activities similar to those seen in South Africa. These paintings
          have been interpreted as representing the trance experiences of shamans
          (the term ‘shaman’ is derived from Siberian concepts of Shamanism and its
          applicability to San|Bushman¹ cultures has been questioned, but it is utilised
          here on the understanding that it sufficiently represents trancers in this
          academic context, where it is the most frequently used term to describe
          them). However, unlike in South Africa, the Matobo Hills rock art is not
          recent and researchers lack the key ethnographic records that help us to
          interpret the paintings. Therefore, interpretations cannot be directly extrapolated
          from the South African paintings to those of the Matobo Hills, and researchers
          such as Peter Garlake have broadened the interpretative framework of this
          art to include social issues in addition to the religious. \n\n"

          in South Africa, rock art does not show evidence of interaction between

          the area were either displaced or absorbed by these new farmer communities.
          However, some of the later paintings show some links with the previous hunter-gatherers
          traditions. This later art consists mainly of schematic figures (usually
          animals, including domestic ones such as goats and cows) and geometric symbols,

        body: 'Zimbabwe is a landlocked country surrounded by Mozambique, Zambia,
          Botswana and South Africa, occupying a large, granitic high plateau between
          the Zambezi and Limpopo river systems, with a tropical climate moderated
          by altitude. The highest part of the country is the eastern Highlands; a
          north-south mountain range reaching altitudes of 2,500 m. Rock art is located
          in two main areas, the northern region of Mashonaland and the south-western
          area of Matabeleland. These areas are full of granite hills and boulders
          that provide excellent shelters for the paintings. The Matobo hills in Matabeleland
          constitute one of the most outstanding examples of rock art in Southern
          Africa. The total number of Zimbabwean rock art sites is unknown, but estimations
          made point to thousands of sites throughout the country, with more being
          discovered annually. '

        title: History of the research
        title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 2'
        body: 'Zimbabwean rock art was first reported by Europeans in 1927, when Miles
          Burkitt visited southern Africa, but is especially linked to Leo Frobenius,
          one of the most renowned researchers in the first decades of the 20th century.
          Leo Frobenius travelled to the region in 1928 with a German team and thoroughly
          documented numerous paintings, identifying many of the most characteristic
          features of Zimbabwean rock art. However, he failed in identifying the authors
          of the paintings, ascribing them to external influences of “high civilizations”
          instead to the local communities who made them. Subsequently, work was continued
          by Elizabeth Mannsfeld-Goodall, who for forty years documented rock art
          paintings constituting a huge corpus of tracings, but without developing
          an interpretative framework for them. In the 1950s, another historic researcher,
          the Abbé Henri Breuil, visited Zimbabwe and studied the paintings, again
          suggesting an Egyptian or Minoan origin. It wasn’t until the 1960s and 1970s
          when a more objective approach to the study of rock art started, with Peter
          Garlake the most prominent figure in research from the 1980s onwards. Garlake
          wrote the first comprehensive books on Zimbabwean rock art (Garlake 1987),
          integrating it within the general framework of southern Africa and raising
          awareness about the importance of these archaeological expressions. In 2003
          the Matobo Hills were included in the World Heritage List acknowledging
          the relevance of Zimbabwean rock art for African heritage. '

        body: The rock art of Zimbabwe is some of the richest in Africa both in variety
          and complexity, the vast majority being painted figures infilled or outlined
          usually with just one colour, although bichrome examples are also known.
          The human figure is the most often represented engaged in different activities
          -hunting, walking, dancing- either isolated or in groups of up to forty
          people. The figures are depicted in different styles, from the very schematic
          to relatively naturalistic outlines, with men far more represented than
          women, and usually depicted carrying bows and arrows. In some cases, these
          figures are part of very complex scenes including animals and geometric
          symbols, some of which have been interpreted as trance-like scenes similar
          to those in South Africa with figures bleeding from their noses, crouching
          or dancing in groups or sharing animal traits. A very specific type of depiction
          is human figures with hugely distended abdomens, a trait that is associated
          either with fertility or mystic potency concepts.

          such as eland, waterbucks or wildebeest are very rarely represented, while
          other animals (lions, cheetah, birds, ant bears, porcupines, baboons or

          for the depiction of females rather than males, especially in the case of
          antelopes or elephants. Regardless of the type of animal, the depictions
          seem to have a deep symbolism far beyond the representation of animals just
          hunted and consumed, often being surrounded by dots, flecks or networks
          of lines. That symbolism is especially important in the case of the elephant,
          which is often depicted being hunted by groups of men. '

          Traditionally, the themes expressed in Zimbabwean rock art have been identified as the same as those of the San|Bushmen¹ from South Africa and in many cases are undoubtedly related, and provide key hints for their interpretation. However, there are also differences, such as the emphasis given to different animals, the higher presence of trees and plants in Zimbabwe or the smaller presence of trance scenes in the north compared to that of the Drakensberg. Moreover, the lack of ethnographic information for Zimbabwean paintings and their older chronology make it difficult to establish the same type of associations as those made for other areas with more direct connections rock art to known cultures, as happens in South Africa. Although in a minority, rock art of a later chronology can be attributed to Iron Age farmers, characterized by more schematic figures, usually white and painted thickly with the finger or the hand. As is the case in other areas in Central Africa, some of these later depictions are related to rain making and initiation ceremonies.

          ¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

        body: "As with much rock art, the dating of Zimbabwe paintings is a challenging
          subject, although there is a consensus about them being significantly older
          than those of the Drakensberg and probably dated at before 2,000 years ago.
          The lack of any type of agriculture-related images in the paintings, which
          was established by the 1st millennium AD, sets a relative dating for the
          depictions, while the scarcity of sheep (introduced by the second half of
          the first millennium BC in the area) points to a time period in which these
          animals were still uncommon. These hints and the fact that, unlike in other
          areas there are not historical subjects represented in the paintings, seems
          to indicate that Zimbabwean paintings are at least 1,000 years old. However,
          archaeological evidence (Walker 2012: 44) suggests that rock art could be
          significantly older than that, at least several thousands of years old.

        Historically, much of the rock art from across northern Africa has been classified according to a particular style or ‘school’ of depictions. One such category of images, known as the Libyan Warrior School or Libyan Warrior style is found predominantly in Niger. Typically, this style

        “…commonly depicts human figures, mainly armed warriors; women are very rare. The style is fairly crude and the technique unsophisticated, almost invariably a rather careless pecking. The figures, almost always presented frontally with their heads quite circular, with added lobes, or mushroom-shaped, are shown according to a symmetrical schema. Various garment decorations and feathers in the hair are common, and the warrior often holds one or two throwing-spears – the bow is almost lacking – and frequently also holds by the leading rein a typical horse; foreshortened with large hindquarters” (Muzzolini, 2001:614)

        Termed *Libyan Warriors* by French ethnographer Henri Lhote, these representations have been associated with Garamantes’ raids, possibly 2,500 years ago. Thought to be descended from Berbers and Saharan pastoralists who settled in central Libya from around 1500 BC, the Garamantes developed a thriving urban centre, with flourishing trade networks from Libya to Niger. In contrast, Francis Rodd, a military man who led two big expeditions to the Sahara in the 1920s, proposed that these figures represent Tuareg; a people reputedly of Berber descent who live a nomadic pastoralist lifestyle. They have their own script known as Tifinagh, which is thought to have Libyan roots and which is engraved onto rocks alongside other rock art depictions.

      body: |
        Libyan Warrior figures are almost exclusively located in the Aïr Mountains of Niger although can also be found in the Adrar des Iforas, north-east Mali extending into Algeria.  Defining the Libyan Warrior Period chronologically is a challenge and dates are fairly fluid; the earliest dates suggested start from 5,200 years ago; it certainly coincides with the Horse period between 3,000-2,000 years ago but has also been proposed to continue throughout the Camel Period, from 2,000 years ago to present.

        From the sample of images we have as part of this collection it is clear that not all figures designated as falling under the umbrella term of Libyan Warrior style all share the same characteristics; there are similarities, differences and adjacencies even between what we may term a ‘typical’ representation. Of course, if these images span a period of 5,000 years then this may account for the variability in the depictions.

      body: However, for the majority of figures their posture is remarkably similar
        even though objects of material culture and the types of garments they wear
        may show more diversity. The overriding feature is that figures are positioned
        frontally with arms bent and raised, often displaying splayed fingers. In
        some cases figures hold weapons and shields, but some do not. Some wear obviously
        elaborate headdresses, but in others the features look more coiffure-like.
        Selected garments are decorated with geometric patterns, others are plain;
        not all wear items of personal ornamentation. Certainly, not all figures are
        associated with horses, as typically characterised. Moreover, rather than
        all being described as unsophisticated or careless, many are executed showing
        great technique and skill. So how do we start to make sense of this contradiction
        between consistency and variation?

      body: A criticism of Saharan rock art research, in comparison to that which
        has focused on other parts of Africa, is an under-theorisation of how the
        art links to past ethnic, archaeological or other identities (Smith,2013:156).
        This is tricky when dealing with past societies which were potentially nomadic,
        and where their archaeological remains are scarce. However, recent anthropological
        research may inform our thinking in this area. A member of the Wodaabe cultural
        group (nomadic cattle-herders and traders in the Sahel) on seeing a photograph
        of a Libyan-Warrior engraving and noting the dress and earrings told photographer
        Carol Beckwith that it represents a woman performing a traditional greeting
        dance with arms outstretched and about to clap (Coulson and Campbell,2001:210).

      body: "Such a comment suggests that local ethnographies might assist in an understanding
        of more recent rock art, that not all figures described as Libyan-Warrior
        may necessarily be the same; and indeed that women may not be as rare as previously
        documented. In fact, the Wodaabe have been noted to resemble figures in other
        Saharan rock art contexts (see article on Hairdressing in the Acacus).\n\nIf
        we accept that some of these representations share affinities with the Wodaabe
        then thinking about this category of images from an ethnographic perspective
        may prove productive. Moreover, the British Museum’s existing ethnographic
        collections are simultaneously a useful resource by which we can potentially
        add more meaning to the rock art images.\n\nThe Wodaabe belong to the Fulani
        people, numbering 20 million and currently living across eighteen countries.
        The Wodaabe comprise 2-3% of the Fulani cultural group, still live as true
        nomads and are considered to have the most traditional culture of all the
        Fulani (Bovin,2001:13).\t\n"

      body: "The Wodaabe have become particularly well-known in the West through visual
        anthropology, because of their emphasis on cultivating male personal beauty
        and adornment. Men invest enormous amounts of time in personal artistic expression;
        much more so than women. Anthropologists have documented the constant checking
        of Wodaabe men in their mirrors; a Wodaabe man will not even go out among
        the cows in the morning until he has checked and tidied himself. They spend
        hours every day on their appearance and have been described as styling themselves
        like “living paintings” and “living statues” (Bovin, 2001:72). Symmetry plays
        a particularly significant part in Wodaabe culture and is reflected in all
        their artistic expressions. Symmetry stands for culture, asymmetry stands
        for nature. Culture is order and nature is disorder (Bovin,2001:17). Everyday
        Wodaabe life is imbued with artistic expression, whereby “every individual
        is an active creator, decorator and performer (Bovin, 2001:15).\n\nSo, how
        might we see Wodaabe cultural traits reflected in the Libyan-Warrior figures?\n\nPlumage
        is often depicted on these Warrior figures and for the most part is assumed
        to simply be part of the warrior regalia. The ostrich feather, a phallic symbol
        in Wodaabe culture, is an important element in male adornment and is carefully
        placed in the axis of symmetry in the middle of a man’s turban, worn during
        dancing ceremonies (Bovin, 2001:41). Music and dancing are typical of Fulani
        traditions, characterized by group singing and accompanied by clapping, stomping
        and bells. The feathers in the British Museum’s collections are known to be
        dance ornaments, worn during particular ceremonies. \n"

      body: However, others may represent shoulder bags or flat baskets which are
        used as vessel covers or food trays; both of which are vital items in a nomadic
        lifestyle. Alternatively, they may represent calabashes. Wodaabe women measure
        their worldly wealth in calabashes and can acquire many in a lifetime, mostly
        ornamental to be displayed only on certain ceremonial occasions. If some of
        these depictions are not necessarily men or warriors then what have been considered
        shields may in fact represent some other important item of material culture.

        There is also a consensus within Wodaabe society about beauty and ugliness; what makes something beautiful or indeed ugly generally is agreed upon, there is a commonality of taste. This may account for the paradox of why there is individuality within a corpus of images that inherently are comparable (Bovin,2001:16).

        As nomads, Wodaabe do not identify themselves by place or territory as such, but a Wodaabe’s body is a repository of culture to mark them out against nature. Culture is not seen as an unessential indulgence but as an imperative necessity, it is part of one’s survival and existence in an inhospitable environment. We may speculate that rock art images may be seen as a way of stamping culture on nature; markers of socialised space.

      body: This brief review was motivated, in part, by the underlying problems inherent
        in the categorisation of visual culture. Historically assigned classifications
        are not fixed and armed with current knowledge across a range of resources
        we may provide further insights into these enigmatic representations. Obviously,
        a much more systematic study of this category known as Libyan-Warrior figures
        needs to be undertaken to determine their distribution and the similarities
        and differences between depictions across sites. Additionally, care must be
        taken making connections with a cultural group whose material culture has
        changed over the course of the twentieth century. Nevertheless, it seems the
        category of Libyan-Warrior figures is an area that is ripe for more intensive
        investigation.

      body: |-
        The rock art of Eastern Africa is characterised by a wide range of non-figurative images, broadly defined as geometric. Occurring in a number of different patterns or designs, they are thought to have been in existence in this region for thousands of years, although often it is difficult to attribute the art to particular cultural groups. Geometric rock art is difficult to interpret, and designs have been variously associated with sympathetic magic, symbols of climate or fertility and altered states of consciousness (Coulson and Campbell, 2010:220). However, in some cases the motifs painted or engraved on the rock face resemble the same designs used for branding livestock and are intimately related to people’s lives and world views in this region.

        First observed in Kenya in the 1970s with the work of Gramly (1975) at Lukenya Hill and Lynch and Robbins (1977) at Namoratung’a, some geometric motifs seen in the rock art of the region were observed to have had their counterparts on the hides of cattle of local communities. Although cattle branding is known to be  practised by several Kenyan groups, Gramly concluded that  “drawing cattle brands on the walls of rock shelters appears to be confined to the regions formerly inhabited by the Maa-speaking pastoralists or presently occupied by them”&dagger;(Gramly, 1977:117).

      body: In the case of Lukenya Hill, the rock shelters on whose walls these geometric
        symbols occur are associated with meat-feasting ceremonies. Meat-feasting
        shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are
        places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat
        in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle.
        During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were
        painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand
        their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners,
        but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease.
        Different symbols may be used for male and female animals.

      body: The sites of Namoratung’a near Lake Turkana in northern Kenya showed a
        similar visible relationship. The southernmost site is well known for its
        167 megalithic stones marking male burials on which are engraved hundreds
        of geometric motifs. Some of these motifs bear a striking resemblance to the
        brand marks that the Turkana mark on their cattle, camels, donkeys and other
        livestock in the area, although local people claim no authorship for the funerary
        engravings (Russell, 2013:4).

      body: Recent research (Russell, 2013) has shown that at Namoratung’a the branding
        of animals signifies a sense of belonging rather than a mark of ownership
        as we understand it in a modern farming context; all livestock, cattle, camel,
        goats, sheep and donkeys are branded according to species and sex (Russell,
        2013:7). Ethnographic accounts document that clan membership can only be determined
        by observing someone with their livestock (Russell, 2013:9). The symbol itself
        is not as important as the act of placing it on the animal’s skin, and local
        people have confirmed that they never mark rock with brand marks. Thus, the
        geometric motifs on the grave markers may have been borrowed by local Turkana
        to serve as identity markers, but in a different context. In the Horn of Africa,
        some geometric rock art is located in the open landscape and on graves. It
        has been suggested that these too are brand or clan marks, possibly made by
        camel keeping pastoralists to mark achievement, territory or ownership (Russell,
        2013:18). Some nomadic pastoralists, further afield, such as the Tuareg, place
        their clan marks along the routes they travel, carved onto salt blocks, trees
        and wells (Mohamed, 1990; Landais, 2001).

      body: "However, not all pastoralist geometric motifs can be associated with
        meat-feasting or livestock branding; they may have wider symbolism or be symbolic
        of something else (Russell, 2013:17).  For example, informants from the Samburu
        people reported that while some of the painted motifs found at Samburu meat-feasting
        shelters were of cattle brands, others represented female headdresses or were
        made to mark an initiation, and in some Masai shelters there are also clear
        representations of warriors’ shields.  In Uganda, a ceremonial rock in Karamoja,
        shows a dung painting consisting of large circles bisected by a cross which
        is said to represent cattle enclosures (Robbins, 1972). Geometric symbols,
        painted in fat and red ochre, on large phallic-shaped fertility stones on
        the Mesakin and Korongo Hills in south Sudan indicate the sex of the child
        to whom prayers are offered (Bell, 1936). A circle bisected by a line or circles
        bisected by two crosses represent boys. Girls are represented by a cross (drawn
        diagonally) or a slanting line (like a forward slash)(Russell, 2013: 17).\n\nAlthough
        pastoralist geometric motifs are widespread in the rock art of eastern Africa,
        attempting to find the meaning behind geometric designs is problematic. The
        examples discussed here demonstrate that motifs can have multiple authors,
        even in the same location, and that identical symbols can be the products
        of very different behaviours. \n"

      body: Libyco-Berber characters were identified as written language as early
        as the 17th century, when some inscriptions in the language were documented
        in the Roman city of Dougga (Tunisia). They were deciphered by F. de Saulcy
        in 1843 through the comparison of personal names with equivalent Punic names
        in bilingual scenes, although a few characters still remain uncertain. Since
        the beginning of the 19th century onwards different many proposals have been
        made to explain the origin, expansion and translation of these alphabets.
        There are three main explanations of its origin; the most accepted theory
        considers that the Libyco-Berber alphabet and principles of writing were borrowed
        from the Phoenician script, with other symbols added locally.

        deriving from a stock of ancient signs –tribal tattoos, marks of ownership,
        or even geometric rock art- which could have resulted in the creation of the
        alphabet. Finally, a mixture of both theories accepts the borrowing of the
        idea of script and some Phoenician signs, which would be complemented with
        indigenous symbols. Although none of these theories can be fully accepted
        or refuted at the present moment, the proposal of a Phoenician borrowing has
        a wider support among linguistics and archaeologists.

      body: 'The study of Libyco-Berber script faces some huge challenges. In addition
        to its aforementioned variability, it is necessary to differentiate the ancient
        languages spoken and written in North Africa during the Classical Antiquity
        for which a generic term of Libyco-Berber is used. Furthermore, Tifinagh script,
        the modern script of Tuareg people shares some symbols with the Libyco-Berber
        alphabet, but otherwise is a quite different language. Contemporary Tuareg
        cannot understand the old Libyco-Berber inscriptions although they recognize
        some symbols. Chronology represents another challenge: although the first
        dated inscription on a *stela* is from 138 BC, some pottery sherds with Libyco-Berber
        symbols could date from the 3rd century BC. For some researchers the oldest
        date (as old as the 7th century BC) is believed to correspond to an engraving
        located in the Moroccan High Atlas, although that theory is still under discussion.
        Finally, the characteristics of the scripts present some problems: they are
        usually short, repetitive and in many cases incomplete. Moreover, Libyco-Berber
        can be written in different directions (from right to left, bottom to top),
        complicating the identification, transcription and translation of the inscriptions. '

      title_internal: 'Libyco-Berber: thematic, chapter 6'
      body: Considering all these problems, what do we know about Libyco-Berber scripts?
        First of all, they normally used only consonants, although due to the influence
        of Punic (the language used in areas controlled or influenced by Carthage)
        and Latin, vowels were added in some alphabet variants. The translation of
        Libyco-Berber scripts is complicated, since the existing texts are very short
        and can only be translated through comparison with equivalent texts in Punic
        or Latin. Most of the translated scripts are very simple and correspond to
        personal and site names, or fixed formulations as “X son of Y”, characteristics
        of funerary epigraphy, or others such as, “It’s me, X”.  Perhaps surprisingly,
        some of the translated inscriptions have an amorous meaning, with expressions
        as “I, X, love Y”. As the known Libyco-Berber corpus of inscriptions grows,
        it seems possible that more and more inscriptions will be translated, leading
        to a better understanding of the languages.

      body: Of course, the Libyco-Berber scripts evolved through time, although discussion
        is still going on about the chronologies and rhythms of this process. After
        the adoption and development of the alphabet, the Libyco-Berber reached a
        consideration of “official language” in the Numidian kingdom, which flourished
        in the north-western coast of Africa during the two latest centuries BC. The
        kingdom was highly influenced by Carthage and Rome, resulting in the existence
        of bilingual inscriptions that were the key to the translation of Libyco-Berber
        scripts. After Roman conquest, Libyco-Berber was progressively abandoned as
        a written language in the area, but inscriptions in the Sahara were still
        common until an unknown moment in the first millennium BC (the scripts sometimes
        receiving the name of Tifinagh). The Berber language, however, has been preserved
        and a new alphabet was developed in the 1960s to be used by Berber people.

      body: The many challenges that surround the study of Libyco-Berber scripts have
        led to a complex crossroads of terms, chronologies and theories which sometimes
        are contradictory and confusing.  For the Rock Art Image Project, a decision
        had to be made to define the painted or engraved scripts in the collection
        and the chosen term was Libyco-Berber, as most of the images are associated
        with paintings of the Horse and Camel periods and thus considered to be up
        to 3,000 years old. Using the term Tifinagh could lead to misunderstandings
        with more modern scripts and the alphabet currently used by Berber peoples
        throughout North Africa.

      body: Undoubtedly, the deciphering of forgotten languages captures the imagination
        and is one of the most exciting challenges in the study of ancient cultures.
        However, it is usually a difficult enterprise, as extraordinary finds which
        aid translation such as the Rosetta Stone are fairly exceptional and most
        of the time the transcription and translation of these languages is a long
        and difficult process in which the meaning of words and grammar rules is slowly
        unravelled. Although there are no shortcuts to this method, there are some
        initiatives that help to ease the task. One of them is making available catalogues
        of high quality images of inscriptions which can be studied and analysed by
        specialists. In that sense, the Libyco-Berber inscriptions present in the
        Rock Art Image Project catalogue can be truly helpful for all those interested
        in one of the most fascinating languages in the world; a language, which albeit
        modified  has endured in different forms for hundreds of years.

        monoliths or the Gondar palaces. Most of these sites are located in northern
        Ethiopia, but to the south of the country there are also some remarkable archaeological
        remains, less well-known but which deserve attention. One of them is the dozens
        of graveyards located along the Rift valley and marked by hundreds of stone
        stelae of different types, usually decorated. Ethiopia holds the biggest concentration
        of steale in all Africa, a testimony of the complexity of the societies which
        inhabited the Horn of Africa at the beginning of the second millennium AD.

        follows the Rift Valley and the series of lakes that occupy its floor, and
        which roughly covers the Soddo, Wolayta and Sidamo regions. The region has
        a tropical climate and is fertile, with warm conditions being predominant
        and rainfall being quite abundant, with annual rates of 1200-1500 mm in the
        lower areas while in the highlands the rainfall reaches 2.000 mm per year.

      body: 'Ethiopian stelae have been known to western scholars since the end of
        the 19th century, with the first examples documented in 1885 to the north
        of Addis Ababa and the news about the main group to the south arriving in
        1905. The first archaeological works in the southern area took place in the
        1920’s carried on by French and German researchers. The work of Père Azaïs
        was especially remarkable, with four expeditions undertaken between 1922 and
        1926 which were partially published in 1931. Along with Azaïs, a German team
        from the Frobénius Institute started to study the site of Tuto Fela, a huge
        cemetery with hundreds of phallic and anthropomorphic stelae located in the
        Sidamo region. Since these early studies the archaeological remains were left
        unattended until the 1970’s, when Francis Anfray excavated the site of Gattira-Demma
        and organized a far more systematic survey in the area which documented dozens
        of stelae of different sizes and types. In the 1980’s, another French team
        started to study first Tiya and then Tuto Fela and another important site,
        Chelba-Tutitti, in a long-term project which has been going on for thirty
        years and has been paramount to understand the types, chronologies and distribution
        of these archaeological remains. The historical importance of these stelae
        was universally recognized in 1980, when Tiya was listed as a UNESCO World
        Heritage Site. '

      title_internal: 'Stela: thematic, chapter 4'
      body: 'The Ethiopian stelae show a great variability in shapes and decorations,
        but at least three main groups could be defined. The first corresponds to
        the so-called phallic stelae, long cylindrical stones with a hemispherical
        top delimited by a groove or ring (Jossaume 2012: 97). The body of the stela
        is sometimes decorated with simple geometric patterns. A second type is known
        as anthropomorphic, with the top of the piece carved to represent a face and
        the rest of the piece decorated with crossed patterns. These two types are
        common to the east of the Rift Valley lakes, while to the south of Addis Ababa
        and to the west of these lakes several other types are present, most of them
        representing anthropomorphs but sometimes plain instead of cylindrical. These
        figures are usually classified depending on the shape and especially the features
        engraved on them –masks, pendants, swords- with the most lavishly carved considered
        the most recent. Probably the best known group is that with swords represented,
        such as those of Tiya, characterized by plain stones in which groups of swords
        (up to nineteen) are depicted along with dots and other unidentified symbols.
        Not all the stelae have these weapons, although those that don’t are otherwise
        identical in shape and have other common signs engraved on them.  Regarding
        their chronology the Ethiopian stela seem to be relatively new, dated from
        the 10th to the 13th centuries, sometimes with one type of stela superimposed
        on another and in other cases with old types being reused in later tombs.'

      body: 'Regardless of their chronology and shape, most of the stela seem to have
        a funerary function, marking the tombs of deceased which were buried in cemeteries
        sometimes reaching hundreds of graves. The information collected from sites
        of such as Tuto Fela show that not all the burials had an attached stela,
        and considering the amount of work necessary to prepare them those which had
        could be interpreted as belonging to high status people. In some cases, such
        as in Tiya, it seems evident that the stela marked the graves of important
        personalities within their communities. It is difficult to determine who the
        groups that carved these stelae were, but given their chronology it seems
        that they could have been Cushitic or Nilotic-speaking pastoralist communities
        absorbed by the Oromo expansion that took place in the sixteenth century.
        A lot of research has still to be done about these graveyards and their associated
        living spaces, and undoubtedly many groups of stelae are yet to be discovered.
        Those studied show, however, the potential interest of ancient communities
        still poorly known but which were able to develop complex societies and these
        material expressions of authority and power. '

      title: Horses and chariots
      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 2'
      body: The first introduction of the domestic horse to Ancient Egypt- and thereby
        to Africa- is usually cited at around 1,600 BC, linked with the arrival in
        Egypt of the Hyksos, a group from the Levant who ruled much of Northern Egypt
        during the Second Intermediate Period. By this point, horses had probably
        only been domesticated for about 2,000 years, but with the advent of the chariot
        after the 3rd millennium BC in Mesopotamia, the horse proved to be a valuable
        martial asset in the ancient world. One of the first clear records of the
        use of horses and chariots in battle in Africa is found in depictions from
        the mortuary complex of the Pharaoh Ahmose at Abydos from around 1,525 BC,
        showing their use by Egyptians in defeating the Hyksos, and horses feature
        prominently in later Egyptian art.

      body: 'Some of the most renowned images of horses in Saharan rock art are also
        those of chariot teams: in particular, those of the so-called ‘flying gallop’
        style chariot pictures, from the Tassili n’Ajjer and Acacus mountains in modern
        Algeria and Libya. These distinctive images are characterised by depictions
        of one or more horses pulling a chariot with their legs outstretched in a
        stylised manner and are sometimes attributed to the Garamantes, a group who
        were a local power in the central Sahara from about 500 BC-700 AD. But the
        Ajjer Plateau is over a thousand miles from the Nile- how and when did the
        horse and chariot first make their way across the Western Desert to the rest
        of North Africa in the first place? Egyptian accounts indicate that by the
        11th century BC Libyans (people living on the north African coast around the
        border of modern Egypt and Libya) were using chariots in war. Classical sources

      title: Horse Riding
      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 4'
      body: As well as the unique iconography of rock art chariot depictions, there
        are also numerous paintings and engravings across northern Africa of people
        riding horses. Riding may have been practiced since the earliest times of
        horse domestication, though the earliest definitive depictions of horses being
        ridden come from the Middle East in the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia BC.
        Images of horses and riders in rock art occur in various areas of Morocco,
        Egypt and Sudan and are particularly notable in the Ennedi region of Chad
        and the Adrar and Tagant plateaus in Mauritania (interestingly, however, no
        definite images of horses are known in the Gilf Kebir/Jebel Uweinat area at
        the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya).

      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 5'
      body: Traditional chronologies for Saharan rock art areas tend to place depictions
        of ridden horses chronologically after those of horses and chariots, and in
        general use horse depictions to categorise regional stylistic periods of rock
        art according to broad date boundaries. As such, in most places, the ‘horse’
        rock art period is usually said to cover about a thousand years from the end
        of the 2nd millennium BC. It is then considered to be succeeded by a ‘camel’
        period, where the appearance of images of dromedaries – known only to have
        been introduced to the eastern Sahara from Arabia at the end of the 1st century
        BC – reflects the next momentous influx of a beast of burden to the area and
        thus a new dating parameter (read more about depictions of camels in the Sahara).
        However, such simplistic categorisation can be misleading. For one thing,
        although mounting horses certainly gained popularity over driving them, it
        is not always clear that depictions of ridden horses are not contemporary
        with those of chariots. Further, the horse remained an important martial tool
        after the use of war-chariots declined. Even after the introduction of the
        camel, there are several apparently contemporary depictions featuring both
        horse and camel riders.

      title: Berber Horses
      title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 6'
      body: As the more manoeuvrable rider rose in popularity against the chariot
        as a weapon of war, historical reports from classical authors like Strabo
        tell us of the prowess of African horsemen such as the cavalry of the Numidians,
        a Berber group that allied with Carthage against the Romans in the 3rd century
        BC. Berber peoples would remain heavily associated with horse breeding and
        riding, and the later rock art of Mauritania has been attributed to Berber
        horsemen, or the sight of them. Although horses may already have reached the
        areas of modern Mauritania and Mali by this point, archaeological evidence
        does not confirm their presence in these south-westerly regions of the Sahara
        until much later, in the mid-1st millennium AD, and it has been suggested
        that some of the horse paintings in Mauritania may be as recent as 16th century.

        trans-Saharan trade routes and became items of great military value in West

        more recent.'

      body: 'Another intriguing possibility is that of gaining clues on the origins
        of modern horse breeds from rock art, in particular the ancient Barb breed
        native to the Maghreb, where it is still bred. Ancient Mesopotamian horses
        were generally depicted as heavily-built, and It has been suggested that the
        basic type for the delicate Arabian horse, with its dished (concave) facial
        profile and high-set tail, may have been developed in north-east Africa prior
        to its subsequent appearance and cultivation in Arabia, and that these features
        may be observed in Ancient Egyptian images from the New Kingdom. Likewise,
        there is the possibility that some of the more naturalistic paintings from
        the central Sahara show the similarly gracile features of the progenitors
        of the Barb, distinguishable from the Arab by its straight profile and low-set
        tail. Like the Arab, the Barb is a desert horse: hardy, sure-footed and able
        to withstand great heat; it is recognised as an ancient breed with an important
        genetic legacy, both in the ancestry of the Iberian horses later used throughout
        the Americas, and that of the modern racing thoroughbred.'

        paucity of ‘naturalistic’ rock art images. Indeed, there is huge diversity
        of horse depictions throughout northern Africa, with some forms highly schematic.
        This variation is not only in style – and, as previously noted, in time period
        and geography – but also in context, as of course images of one subject cannot
        be divorced from the other images around them, on whichever surface has been

      body: The nature of the depictions in this sense speaks intriguingly of the
        apparent symbolism and implied value of the horse image in different cultural
        contexts. Where some Tassilian horses are delicately painted in lifelike detail,
        the stockier images of horses associated with the so-called ‘Libyan Warrior’
        style petroglyphs of the Aïr mountains and Adrar des Ifoghas in Niger and
        Mali appear more as symbolic accoutrements to the central human figures and
        tend not to be shown as ridden. By contrast, there are paintings in the Ennedi
        plateau of Chad where galloping horse figures have clearly been painted over
        existing walking human figures to make them appear as if riding.

        In each of these cases, the original symbolic intent of the artists have been lost to time, but with these horse depictions, as with so much African rock art imagery, there is great scope for further future analysis. Particularly intriguing, for example, are the striking stylistic similarities in horse depictions across great distances, such the horse depictions with bi-triangular bodies (e.g. figs 5 &13), or with fishbone-style tails which may be found almost two thousand miles apart in Chad and Mauritania.

        Whatever the myriad circumstances and significances of the images, it is clear that following its introduction to the continent, the hardy and surefooted desert horse’s usefulness for draught, transport and fighting purposes transformed the societies which used it and gave it a powerful symbolic value.

      body: Hair is a global form of social communication. Among numerous social groups
        throughout Africa, hairstyling and hairdressing hold great cultural and aesthetic
        significance. Coiffures have been regarded as indicative of ethnic origin,
        gender and stages of life development – as well as simply fashion – and have
        been related to power, age, religion and politics. The transitory yet highly
        visible nature of hair ensures its suitability as a medium for personal and
        social expression. And it is not just the domain of women; elaborate hair-styling
        for men can be an equally important indicator of their place in society.

        We have recently documented a particularly interesting set of images from Uan Amil, at Wadi Teshuinat in the Acacus Mountains, south-western Libya, which reflect the cultural significance of hair in African societies. The scenes depict groups of people engaged in a variety of communal social practices wearing elaborate coiffures (Fig. 1), together with some very discrete moments of personal hairdressing.

        The image below (Fig. 2), which is part of a larger panel (Fig. 3), shows an intimate moment between two persons, an individual with an ornate coiffure washing or attending to the hair of another. In some African societies, a person’s choice of hairdresser is dictated by their relationship to them. It is most often the work of friends or family to whom you entrust your hair. In the hands of a stranger or adversary hair can be used as an ingredient in the production a powerful substance that could afflict its owner; such is the potency of hair. This image well conveys such intimacy.

      body: 'The rock shelter of Uan Amil was discovered in 1957 by the Italian-Libyan
        Joint Archaeological Mission surveying in the Acacus and Messak regions of
        Libya. Excavations have indicated the shelter was in use over a long period,
        with at least three main occupational phases between the 8th and 4th millennium
        BP. Italian archaeologist Fabrizio Mori has dated these paintings to 6,000
        years ago, while David Coulson has been more cautious and has suggested that
        the presence of a metal blade on the arrow head seen at the bottom of this
        image may indicate a more recent age. Notwithstanding the problems associated
        with the dating of rock art, the subject matter is intriguing. It has been
        suggested that today’s Wodaabe nomads of Niger resemble the people on these
        rock paintings: ‘the cattle look the same, as do the campsites with their
        calf-ropes, and the women’s hairstyles with the special bun on the forehead.
        The female hair bun is big and round like a globe.’ (Bovin, 2001:12).'

        The Wodaabe number around 125,000. As pastoral nomads they migrate often and over large geographical areas, keeping mahogany-coloured Zebu cattle which have a hump on their back and long horns, shaped like a lyre. As a cultural group they have attracted much anthropological attention because of their traditional values of beauty (in particular the male beauty pageant) which pervades their everyday lives and practices.

        Wodaabe seldom wash their entire bodies mainly because of the scarcity of water. Water from wells is mainly used for drinking by humans and animals. Washing the body and clothes is less of a priority; and hair is hardly ever washed. When Wodaabe put rancid butter on their hair it is to make it soft and shiny and cleanse it of dust and lice. To them rancid butter gives a nice sweet smell (Bovin, 2011: 56). Fig. 2 shows a vessel sitting between the two individuals that may have served to hold rancid butter used in the preparation of the hair; in fact, treating the hair with butter is a widespread practice in African societies. In addition, Wodaabe never cut their hair; everybody (men and women alike) want to have hair as long as possible, as represented in Figs. 2 and 5. The ideal girl should have long, thick, black hair, enough to make a huge round bun on her forehead, while the ideal young male should have long, thick black hair to make braids to the shoulders.

      body: |-
        A long, narrow face is also admired and this is enhanced by shaping the hair on top of the head, and also using an ostrich feather to elongate the face (Bovin, 2001:26). The painting in Fig. 4, also from Wadi Teshuinat, characterises this.

        Interestingly, the coiffures in Figs. 1, 2 and 3 are light in colour and do not conform to the black ideal as indicated above. It has been suggested that this represents Caucasians with blonde hair. However, it may also be a visual strategy to emphasise the aesthetics of the coiffure. Hairstyles in African sculpture are often shown conceptually, rather than mimetically; idealising rather than copying exactly from contemporary hairdressing practices. In this respect representation follows artistic traditions as much as, or more than, it responds to ephemeral shifts in fashion.

      body: The importance of hair styling and its importance in social practices
        are evident in Figs. 3 and 6 where hair-washing, hairstyling or hair preparation
        is an active element within more complex social and cultural activities. Fig.
        3 has been interpreted as showing preparations for a wedding, while Fig. 5/6
        is understood as a scene of supplication, with people visiting a man in a
        curved shelter; it may even be a representation of the cave. In addition,
        the C-shaped feature has been suggested to be a coiled snake and the figure
        sits between the head and tail. It may seem incongruous to have hair preparation
        scenes represented within a tableau representing a wedding or ceremonial meeting,
        but may say something more about the nature of representation. In each case,
        these may represent a conceptual depiction of time and space. These activities
        are not ones that occur concurrently temporally and spatially, but rather
        represent an assemblage of discrete moments that contribute to each ceremony
        in its entirety.

      body: The Wodaabe invest vast amounts of time and resources in their outward
        appearance and the need to beautify and refine. ‘Art’ is not just something
        that is aesthetically pleasing; it is a necessity of life, a necessity that
        must be exhibited. While there are likely to be a variety of complex social,
        economic and cultural motivations, that necessity is possibly additionally
        driven or fuelled by a seemingly desolate, unadorned, irregular landscape.
        The importance lies in distinguishing oneself as a cultural being rather than
        the ‘uncultured other’, such as an animal; and hair is an apposite medium
        by which to make this nature/culture distinction. Hair care in African societies
        is unmistakably aesthetic in its aspirations as it gets transferred into other
        artistic mediums, and the divide between nature and culture is thoroughly
        and intentionally in play. To transform hair is to transform nature, and is
        truly an artistic discipline.

        Desert, notably the Fezzan region, have included paintings of chariots in
        a variety of forms, dating to the Horse Period, from up to 3,000 years ago.
        This has stimulated some interesting questions about the use of chariots in
        what appears to be such a seemingly inappropriate environment for a wheeled
        vehicle, as well as the nature of representation. Why were chariots used in
        the desert and why were they represented in such different ways?

      body: The chariot has been one of the great empowering innovations of history.
        It likely originated in Mesopotamia about 3000 BC due to advances in metallurgy
        during the Bronze Age, and has served as a primary means of transport until
        quite recently in the historical period across Africa, Eurasia and Europe.
        Chariots provided rapid and efficient transport, and were ideal for the battlefield
        as the design provided a raised firing platform for archers . As a result
        the chariot became the principal war machine from the Egyptians through to
        the Romans; and the Chinese, who owned an army of 10,000 chariots. Indeed,
        our use of the word car is a derivative of the Latin word carrus, meaning
        ‘a chariot of war or of triumph’.

        cultural group thought to be descended from Berbers and Saharan pastoralists.
        There is little textual information about the Garamantes, documentation comes
        mainly from Greek and Roman sources. Herodotus described them as ‘a very great
        nation’. Recent archaeological research has shown that the Garamantes established
        about eight major towns as well as numerous other settlements, and were ‘brilliant
        farmers, resourceful engineers, and enterprising merchants’. The success of
        the Garamantes was based on their subterranean water-extraction system, a
        network of underground tunnels, allowing the Garamantian culture to flourish
        in an increasingly arid environment, resulting in population expansion, urbanisation,
        and conquest.

      title_internal: 'Thematic: chariots, chapter 4'
      body: On average there are about 500 drawings of chariots across the Sahara,
        from the Fezzan in Libya through the Aïr of Niger into northern Mali and then
        westward to the Atlantic coast; but not all were produced by the Garamantes.
        It is still not certain that chariots were driven along the routes where their
        depictions occur; remains of chariots have never been found west of the Fezzan.
        However, the Fezzan states were thriving trade routes and chariots are likely
        to have been used to transport salt, cloth, beads and metal goods in exchange
        for gold, ivory and slaves. The widespread occurrence of chariot imagery on
        Saharan rock outcrops has led to the proposition of ‘chariot routes’ linking
        North and West Africa. However, these vehicles were not suited for long-distance
        transport across desert terrain; more localised use is probable, conducted
        through middlemen who were aware of the trade routes through the desert landscape.
        Additionally, the horse at this time was a prestige animal and it is unlikely
        that they facilitated transport across the Saharan trade routes, with travellers
        rather utilising donkeys or oxen.

      title_internal: 'Thematic: chariots, chapter 5'
      body: The absence of archaeological evidence for chariots has led to the suggestion
        that some representations of chariots may have been the result of cultural
        diffusion, transmitted orally by nomadic peoples traversing the region. Artists
        may never have actually seen the vehicles themselves. If this is the case,
        chariot symbols may have acquired some special meaning above their function
        as modes of transport. It may also explain why some representations of chariots
        do not seem to conform to more conventional styles of representations and
        account for the different ways in which they were depicted.

        Figs. 7 and 8 may or may not depict chariots. The rectangular shape in the top left of Fig. 7 and to the left in Fig. 8 are potentially abstracted forms of the chariot similar to the ‘flattened out’ depictions above in Figs. 5 and 6. The representation in Fig. 7 sits alongside distinguishing figures of the Horse Period when chariots were being used, such as geometric bi-triangular figures, spears or lances, women wearing long dresses, and animals drawn in a fairly naturalistic style.

        Beside the schematic and simply depicted chariots, there is also a group which has been termed the ‘flying gallop chariots’ (Fig.3 above and Fig. 9 below). Their distribution includes the whole Tassili region, although there are fewer in the Acacus Mountains. They resemble the classical two-wheeled antique chariots, generally drawn by two horses, but sometimes three, or even four. The driver is usually alone, and is depicted in a typical style with a stick head. The majority are shown at full speed, with the driver holding a whip standing on a small platform, sometimes straining forward.

        In a similar manner to the schematic chariots, the depictions in Figs. 3 and 9 display the entire platform and both wheels of the chariot. In addition, more than one horse is depicted as a single horse in profile with numerous legs indicating multiple horses; an artistic technique first seen during the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe. Interestingly, in the Libyan rock art of the Acacus Mountains it seemed that animals could be conceived of in profile and in movement, but chariots were conceived of differently, and are represented in plain view, seen from above or in three-quarters perspective.

        Why are chariots depicted in a variety of ways, and what can we say about the nature of representation in relation to chariots? It is clear that chariots are able to be depicted in profile view (Fig. 1), yet there are variations that digress from this perspective. In relation to the few examples we have come across so far in the Acacus Mountains in south-western Libya, one observation we might make is that the ways in which chariots have been represented may be indicative of the ways in which they have been observed by the artists representing them; as a rule from above. The rock shelters in the Acacus are often some height above the now dried up wadis, and so the ways in which they conceived of representing the chariot itself , whether as a flying gallop chariot, a chariot drawn by a bovid or as an abstraction, may have become a particular representational convention. The ways in which animals were represented conformed also to a convention, one that had a longer tradition, but chariots were an innovation and may have been represented as they were observed; from higher up in the rockshelters; thus chariots were conceived of as a whole and from an aerial perspective. The ways in which environments affect our perceptions of dimension, space and colour are now well-established, initially through cross-cultural anthropological studies in the 1960s, and becoming better understood through more recent research concerning the brain. Of course, this is speculation, and further research would be needed to consider all the possibilities. But for now, we can start to see some intriguing lines of enquiry and research areas that these images have stimulated.

      body: Vast trading network across the Sahara Desert not only facilitated the
        spread of goods, but the routes served as a conduit for cultural diffusion
        through the spread of knowledge, ideas and technologies. Chariots were both
        functional and symbolic. As a mode of transport, as a weapon of war, as a
        means of trade and exchange and as a symbol of power, the chariot has been
        a cultural artefact for 4,000 years. Its temporal and spatial reach is evident
        not only in the rock art, but through the British Museum collections, which
        reveal comparisons between 2D rock art and 3D artefacts. Similarities and
        adjacencies occur not only in the structure and design of the chariots themselves
        but in their symbolic and pragmatic nature (Figs. 10–14).

        were unearthed near Misurata, Libya, probably used to pay both regular Roman
        and local troops. Such finds demonstrate the symbolic power of the chariot
        and the diffusion of the imagery.

      body: Fishing is an ancient practice in Africa, dating back 100,000 years, when
        modern humans started moving into coastal environments. The remains of thousands
        of fish bones and shellfish from sites on the southern African coastline dating
        to the Middle Stone Age testify to its antiquity. At the same time that human
        populations in Africa were developing more sophisticated terrestrial hunting
        technologies, they were also acquiring innovative and productive fishing and
        riverine hunting skills. Concomitantly, marine shells were being collected
        to thread on to twine, probably for use as items of personal ornamentation.
        Archaeological research has shown that aquatic environments have been exploited
        for both subsistence and cultural purposes for tens of thousands of years.

      body: |-
        We rarely consider the Sahara as the optimum environment for fishing. Seeing painted and engraved images of fish located in these waterless and unfavourable landscapes therefore seems at odds with our present-day knowledge of this vast desert. However, as we have noted before in these project pages (see introductions to Libya and Algeria), water-dependent animals such as crocodile and hippo have regularly been depicted in Saharan rock art, illustrating a once wetter and more fertile landscape. To date, the African rock art image project has catalogued representations of aquatic species in Libya, Algeria and Morocco, depicted with varying degrees of proficiency and ease of identification. This has been an insightful encounter, because it not only informs our thinking about the nature of the environment in the past and the way people were using their available resources, but also allows us to think about the cultural importance of water-based species.

        The rock art in these places is a glimpse into an aquatic past that is now supported by environmental evidence. In a recent collaborative project mapping ancient watercourses in the Sahara, it has been shown that during the Holocene (a period which started around 11,700 years ago), this now arid landscape was once covered by a dense interconnected river system, as well as large bodies of water known as ‘megalakes’. When these lakes overflowed, they linked catchment areas, resulting in a dense palaeoriver network that allowed water-dependent life (fish, molluscs and amphibians) to migrate and disperse across an extensive landscape. This interlinked waterway of the Sahara formed a single and vast biogeographic area. Perhaps not surprisingly, rock art sites appear to be clustered around inland deltas where resources would have been most plentiful.

        Across the Sahara, at least twenty-three species of fish have been identified in archaeological deposits from the Holocene, the most common being Tilapia, Catfish, African jewelfish, Silver fish and Nile perch. But can we go as far as to correlate the archaeological record with the rock art to species level?

      body: Rock art imagery is replete with both very naturalistic representations
        and also those which are more conceptual or abstract in nature, and the depictions
        of fish are no exception. While the representations in Figs. 1 and 2 are clearly
        identifiable (and may depict a Nile perch in the former), that in Fig. 3 is
        more difficult to identify. The vertical red dots on the left of the photograph
        are arranged in a fish-like shape that converges at the top and bottom. Additionally
        it has been deliberately placed on a section of the rock face where there
        is water seepage, blending the art with the natural environment. The dotted
        pattern is reminiscent of the African jewelfish (*Hemichromis letourneauxi*)
        (Fig. 4) or even the Redbelly Tilapia (*Tilapia zillii*) (Fig. 5), both shown
        to be species of fish found throughout much of the Sahara during the Holocene.

      body: Figs. 6 and 8 show engravings of fish that bear close morphological resemblances
        to Catfish, with even the barbels depicted. Catfish seem to occur more regularly
        in rock art than other species of fish, possibly due to their physical characteristics.
        They possess an auxiliary breathing organ which allows them to inhabit extremely
        de-oxygenated water; in fact, when necessary they can obtain up to 50% of
        their total oxygen requirements from the air. In some cases they will leave
        the water and crawl on dry ground to escape drying pools. This capacity to
        live in very shallow waters and to occupy the liminal spaces between land
        and water has elevated them to more than a simple food source and given them
        a place of cultural significance in many African societies.

      title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 5'
      body: In arid ecosystems, bodies of water are characterised by daily and seasonal
        fluctuations in water temperature, evaporation and other natural phenomena,
        and some fish species have adapted well to cope with these extreme changes
        in water chemistry. Catfish and Tilapia in particular are able to survive
        high salinity, which occurs through evaporation, while Redbelly Tilapia can
        also tolerate temperatures above 35° C. Both Sharptooth Catfish and Tilapia
        are floodplain dwellers and possess the ability to live and spawn in shallow
        waters, making them easily susceptible to predation. Catfish spines were also
        used to decorate Saharan pottery with dotted wavy-line patterns. These biological
        characteristics, which meant they could be easily hunted, may explain their
        frequent depiction in rock art. Perhaps their value was also reinforced by
        their being (possibly) the last fish species to survive once aridification
        had taken hold in the Sahara.

      title: Fishing
      title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 6'
      body: Fish are likely to have been caught in a variety of ways, but in the Sahara
        the most common technique was to use barbed bone point and/or fish hook technology,
        with the former being the most archaeologically visible. Barbed points may
        either be fixed – that is permanently attached to a spear or arrow shaft –
        or used as ‘harpoons’, when they separate from a shaft on impact and remain
        attached by a line. Barbed points can actually be used to catch multiple types
        of prey, but the primary use across Africa was for fish.

      body: Chronologically, the earliest barbed bone point records are from Katanda
        in the Upper Semliki Valley in modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo,
        dating to 80,000 – 90,000 years ago. Here people were catching Catfish weighing
        up to 68 kg (150 lb), sufficient to feed eighty people for two days. Research
        has noted the distribution of barbed bone points across the Sahara, and the
        correlation between these locations and the distribution of species requiring
        deep water. It is clear that there is continuity in sophisticated fishing
        technology and practice that has lasted tens of thousands of years.

      title: Other aquatic species
      title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 8'
      body: Other aquatic species are more difficult to identify and are much rarer.
        For example, Fig 12a has been interpreted as a jelly-fish like creature. The
        photograph here has been digitally manipulated to enhance the image and on
        closer inspection However, by manipulating the colour and lighting as in Fig.
        12b, the image is a little clearer and appears to share morphological characteristics
        with a turtle rather than a jellyfish – such as the rounded carapace and small
        flippers – with a turtle rather than a jellyfish. Furthermore, we know that
        softshell turtles (*Trionyx triunguis*) have been found in archaeological
        deposits in the Sahara dating to the Holocene. The vertical and wavy strands
        hanging down underneath could represent the pattern made in the sand by turtles
        when walking rather than being the tendrils of a jellyfish. Moreover, Fig
        13 appears to resemble a snail and would be consistent with what we know about
        the Capsian culture who inhabited modern Tunisia and Algeria and parts of
        Libya during the early Holocene (10,000–6,000 BC). Their distinguishing culinary
        feature was a fondness for escargots – edible land snails.

      title: Case study – Gobero
      title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 9'
      body: A recently excavated cemetery site called Gobero (Fig. 14) (see citation),
        situated on the western edge of the Ténéré desert in Niger, provides a uniquely
        preserved record of human occupation in the Sahara during the Holocene and
        puts into context some of the examples of rock art we have looked at here.
        Pollen analysis has indicated that during the Holocene, Gobero was situated
        in an open savannah landscape of grasses and sedges, with fig trees and tamarisk,
        where permanent water and marshy habitats were present.

        Approximately 200 burials, ranging over a 5000-year period, were found on the edge of an ancient lake. Grave goods include bones or tusks from wild fauna, ceramics, lithic projectile points, and bone, ivory and shell ornaments. One adult male was buried in a recumbent pose seated on the carapace of a mud turtle. Microliths, bone harpoon points and hooks, and ceramics with dotted wavy-line and zigzag impressed motifs were found in the burial fill, in an associated midden area, and in nearby paleolake deposits. Nile perch (*Lates niloticus*), large catfish, and tilapia dominate the midden fauna, which also includes bones and teeth from hippos, several bovids, small carnivores, softshell turtles and crocodiles.

        The early Holocene occupants at Gobero (7700–6300 BC.) were largely sedentary hunter-fisher-gatherers with lakeside funerary sites. Across the ‘green’ Sahara, Catfish, Tilapia and turtles played important roles socially, economically and culturally. We can see this most explicitly in the burial within a turtle carapace in Gobero, but the representation of aquatic animals in rock art is a significant testament to their value.

      body: Yet, surprising as it seems, the camel is a relative newcomer to the Sahara
        – at least when compared to other domestic animals such as cattle, sheep,
        horses and donkeys. Although the process is not yet fully known, camels were
        domesticated in the Arabian Peninsula around the third millennium BC, and
        spread from there to the Middle East, North Africa and Somalia from the 1st
        century AD onwards. The steps of this process from Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean
        have been documented through many different historical sources, from Roman
        texts to sculptures or coins, but it is especially relevant in Saharan rock
        art, where camels became so abundant that they have given their name to a
        whole period. The depictions of camels provide an incredible amount of information
        about the life, culture and economy of the Berber and other nomadic communities
        from the beginnings of the Christian era to the Muslim conquest in the late
        years of the 7th century.

      body: 'What is it that makes camels so suited to deserts? It is not only their
        ability to transform the fat stored in their hump into water and energy, or
        their capacity to eat thorny bushes, acacia leaves and even fish and bones.
        Camels are also able to avoid perspiration by manipulating their core temperature,
        enduring fluctuations of up to six degrees that could be fatal for other mammals.
        They rehydrate very quickly, and some of their physical features (nostrils,
        eyebrows) have adapted to increase water conservation and protect the animals
        from dust and sand. All these capacities make camels uniquely suited to hot
        climates: in temperatures of 30-40 °C, they can spend up to 15 days without
        water. In addition, they are large animals, able to carry loads of up to 300kg,
        over long journeys across harsh environments. The pads on their feet have
        evolved so as to prevent them from sinking into the sand. It is not surprising
        that dromedaries are considered the ‘ships of the desert’, transporting people,
        commodities and goods through the vast territories of the Sahara.'

      body: As mentioned previously, camels came from the Arabian Peninsula through
        Egypt, where bone remains have been dated to the early 1st millennium BC.
        However, it took hundreds of years to move into the rest of North Africa due
        to the River Nile, which represented a major geographical and climatic barrier
        for these animals. The expansion began around the beginning of the Christian
        era, and probably took place both along the Mediterranean Sea and through
        the south of the Sahara. At this stage, it appears to have been very rapid,
        and during the following centuries camels became a key element in the North
        African societies. They were used mainly for riding, but also for transporting
        heavy goods and even for ploughing. Their milk, hair and meat were also used,
        improving the range of resources available to their herders. However, it seems
        that the large caravans that crossed the desert searching for gold, ivory
        or slaves came later, when the Muslim conquest of North Africa favoured the
        establishment of vast trade networks with the Sahel, the semi-arid region
        that lies south of the Sahara.

      body: Rock art can be extremely helpful in learning about the different ways
        in which camels were used in the first millennium AD. Images of camels are
        found in both engravings and paintings in red, white or – on rare occasions
        – black; sometimes the colours are combined to achieve a more impressive effect.
        They usually appear in groups, alongside humans, cattle and, occasionally,
        dogs and horses. Sometimes, even palm trees and houses are included to represent
        the oases where the animals were watered. Several of the scenes show female
        camels herded or taking care of their calves, showing the importance of camel-herding
        and breeding for the Libyan-Berber communities.

        That camels were used to transport goods is obvious, and depictions of long lines of animals are common, sometimes with saddles on which to place the packs and ropes to tie the animals together. However, if rock art depictions are some indication of camel use, it seems that until the Muslim conquest the main function of one-humped camels was as mounts, often linked to war. The Sahara desert contains dozens of astonishingly detailed images of warriors riding camels, armed with spears, long swords and shields, sometimes accompanied by infantry soldiers and horsemen. Although camels are not as good as horses for use as war mounts (they are too tall and make insecure platforms for shooting arrows), they were undoubtedly very useful in raids – the most common type of war activity in the desert – as well as being a symbol of prestige, wealth and authority among the desert warriors, much as they still are today.

        Moreover, the extraordinary detail of some of the rock art paintings has provided inestimable help in understanding how (and why) camels were ridden in the 1st millennium AD. Unlike horses, donkeys or mules, one-humped camels present a major problem for riders: where to put the saddle. Although it might be assumed that the saddle should be placed over the hump, they can, in fact, also be positioned behind or in front of the hump, depending on the activity. It seems that the first saddles were placed behind the hump, but that position was unsuitable for fighting, quite uncomfortable, and unstable. Subsequently, a new saddle was invented in North Arabia around the 5th century BC: a framework of wood that rested over the hump and provided a stable platform on which to ride and fight more effectively. The North Arabian saddle led to a revolution in the domestication of one-humped camels, allowed a faster expansion of the use of these animals, and it is probably still the most used type of saddle today.

      body: 'Although North Arabian saddles are found throughout North Africa and
        are often depicted in rock art paintings, at some point a new kind of saddle
        was designed in North Africa: one placed in front of the hump, with the weight
        over the shoulders of the camel. This type of shoulder saddle allows the rider
        to control the camel with the feet and legs, thus improving the ride. Moreover,
        the rider is seated in a lower position and thus needs shorter spears and
        swords that can be brandished more easily, making warriors more efficient.
        This new kind of saddle, which is still used throughout North Africa today,
        appears only in the western half of the Sahara and is well represented in
        the rock art of Algeria, Niger and Mauritania. And it is not only saddles
        that are recognizable in Saharan rock art: harnesses, reins, whips or blankets
        are identifiable in the paintings and show astonishing similarities to those
        still used today by desert peoples.'

      title_internal: 'Camels: thematic, chapter 8'
      body: Since their introduction to the Sahara during the first centuries of the
        Christian era, camels have become indispensable for desert communities, providing
        a method of transport for people and commodities, but also for their milk,
        meat and hair for weaving. They allowed the improvement of wide cultural and
        economic networks, transforming the Sahara into a key node linking the Mediterranean
        Sea with Sub-Saharan Africa. A symbol of wealth and prestige, the Libyan-Berber
        peoples recognized camels’ importance and expressed it through paintings and
        engravings across the desert, leaving a wonderful document of their societies.
        The painted images of camel-riders crossing the desert not only have an evocative
        presence, they are also perfect snapshots of a history that started two thousand
        years ago and seems as eternal as the Sahara.

      title: Central and East Africa
      title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 1'
      body: |-
        Central Africa is dominated by vast river systems and lakes, particularly the Congo River Basin. Characterised by hot and wet weather on both sides of the equator, central Africa has no regular dry season, but aridity increases in intensity both north and south of the equator. Covered with a forest of about 400,000 m² (1,035,920 km²), it is one of the greenest parts of the continent.  The rock art of central Africa stretches from the Zambezi River to the Angolan Atlantic coast and reaches as far north as Cameroon and Uganda. Termed the ‘schematic rock art zone’ by Desmond Clark (1959), it is dominated by finger-painted geometric motifs and designs, thought to extend back many thousands of years.

        Eastern Africa, from the Zambezi River Valley to Lake Turkana, consists largely of a vast inland plateau with the highest elevations on the continent, such as Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m above sea level) and Mount Kenya (5,199 m above sea level). Twin parallel rift valleys run through the region, which includes the world’s second largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria. The climate is atypical of an equatorial region, being cool and dry due to the high altitude and monsoon winds created by the Ethiopian Highlands. The rock art of eastern Africa is concentrated on this plateau and consists mainly of paintings that include animal and human representations. Found mostly in central Tanzania, eastern Zambia and Malawi; in comparison to the widespread distribution of geometric rock art, this figurative tradition is much more localised, and found at just a few hundred sites in a region of less than 100km in diameter.

        The rock art of East Africa, in particular the red paintings from Tanzania, was extensively studied by Mary and Louis Leakey in the 1930s and 1950s. Eric Ten Raa observed Sandawe people of Tanzania making rock paintings in the mid-20th century, and on the basis of oral traditions argued that the rock art was made for three main purposes: casual art; magic art (for hunting purposes or connected to health and fertility) and sacrificial art (to appease ancestral spirits). Subsequently, during the 1970s Fidelis Masao and Emmanuel Anati recorded numerous sites, classifying the art in broad chronological and stylistic categories, proposing tentative interpretations with regard to meaning.

        There has much debate and uncertainty about Central African rock art.  The history of the region has seen much mobility and interaction of cultural groups and understanding how the rock art relates to particular groups has been problematic. Pioneering work in this region was undertaken by Margaret Metcalfe in central Malawi in the early 1920s, Clarence van Riet Lowe visited Zambia in 1936 and attempted to provide a chronological sequence and some insight into the meaning of the rock art. Since the 1950s (Clarke, 1959), archaeologists have attempted to situate rock art within broader archaeological frameworks in order to resolve chronologies, and to categorise the art with reference to style, colour, superimposition, subject matter, weathering, and positioning of depictions within the panel (Phillipson, 1976). Building on this work, our current understanding of rock in this region has been advanced by Benjamin Smith (1995, 1997, 2001) with his work in Zambia and Malawi.

      body: "Rock art of East Africa consists mainly of paintings, most of which are
        found in central Tanzania, and are fewer in number in eastern Zambia and Malawi;
        scholars have categorised them as follows:\n\n*__Red Paintings__*:  \nRed
        paintings can be sub-divided into those found in central Tanzania and those
        found stretching from Zambia to the Indian Ocean.\nTanzanian red paintings
        include large, naturalistic animals with occasional geometric motifs. The
        giraffe is the most frequently painted animal, but antelope, zebra, elephant,
        rhino, felines and ostrich are also depicted. Later images show figures with
        highly distinctive stylised human head forms or hairstyles and body decoration,
        sometimes in apparent hunting and domestic scenes. The Sandawe and Hadza,
        hunter-gatherer groups, indigenous to north-central and central Tanzania respectively,
        claim their ancestors were responsible for some of the later art.\n\nThe area
        in which Sandawe rock art is found is less than 100km in diameter and occurs
        at just a few hundred sites, but corresponds closely to the known distribution
        of this group. There have been some suggestions that Sandawe were making rock
        art early into the 20th century, linking the art to particular rituals, in
        particular simbo; a trance dance in which the Sandawe communicate with the
        spirit world by taking on the power of an animal. The art displays a range
        of motifs and postures, features that can be understood by reference to simbo
        and to trance experiences; such as groups of human figures bending at the
        waist (which occurs during the *simbo* dance), taking on animal features such
        as ears and tails, and floating or flying; reflecting the experiences of those
        possessed in the dance."

      body: "Zambian rock art does not share any similarities with Tanzanian rock
        art and can be divided into two categories; animals (with a few depictions
        of humans), and geometric motifs. Animals are often highly stylised and superimposed
        with rows of dots. Geometric designs include, circles, some of which have
        radiating lines, concentric circles, parallel lines and ladder shapes. Predominantly
        painted in red, the remains of white pigment is still often visible. David
        Phillipson (1976) proposed that the naturalistic animals were earlier in date
        than geometric designs. Building on Phillipson’s work, Benjamin Smith studied
        ethnographic records and demonstrated that geometric motifs were made by women
        or controlling the weather.\n\n*__Pastoralist paintings__*: \nPastoralist
        paintings are rare, with only a few known sites in Kenya and other possible
        sites in Malawi. Usually painted in black, white and grey, but also in other
        colours, they include small outlines, often infilled, of cattle and are occasional
        accompanied by geometric motifs. Made during the period from 3,200 to 1,800
        years ago the practice ceased after Bantu language speaking people had settled
        in eastern Africa. Similar paintings are found in Ethiopia but not in southern
        Africa, and it has been assumed that these were made by Cushitic or Nilotic
        speaking groups, but their precise attribution remains unclear (Smith, 2013:154).\n"

        *__Late White Paintings__*:
        Commonly painted in white, or off-white with the fingers, so-called ‘Late White’ depictions include quite large crudely rendered representations of wild animals, mythical animals, human figures and numerous geometric motifs. These paintings are attributed to Bantu language speaking, iron-working farmers who entered eastern Africa about 2,000 years ago from the west on the border of Nigeria and Cameroon. Moving through areas occupied by the Batwa it is thought they learned the use of symbols painted on rock, skin, bark cloth and in sand. Chewa peoples, Bantu language speakers who live in modern day Zambia and Malawi claim their ancestors made many of the more recent paintings which they used in rites of passage ceremonies.

        *__Meat-feasting paintings__*:
        Meat-feasting shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle. The term Maa relates to a group of closely related Eastern Nilotic languages, which historically dominated the east African hinterland; and today is spoken by around a million people. During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners, but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease. Different symbols may be used for male and female animals. Over the centuries, because the depictions are on the ceiling of meat feasting rock shelters, and because sites are used even today, a build-up of soot has obscured or obliterated the paintings. Unfortunately, few have been recorded or mapped.

      title: 'Categories: CENTRAL AFRICA'
      title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 7'
      body: The rock art of central Africa is attributed to hunter-gatherers known
        as Batwa. This term is used widely in eastern central and southern Africa
        to denote any autochthonous hunter-gatherer people. The rock art of the Batwa
        can be divided into two categories which are quite distinctive stylistically
        from the Tanzanian depictions of the Sandawe and Hadza. Nearly 3,000 sites
        are currently known from within this area. The vast majority, around 90%,
        consist of finger-painted geometric designs; the remaining 10% include highly
        stylised animal forms (with a few human figures) and rows of finger dots.
        Both types are thought to date back many thousands of years. The two traditions
        co-occur over a vast area of eastern and central Africa and while often found
        in close proximity to each other are only found together at a few sites. However,
        it is the dominance of geometric motifs that make this rock art tradition
        very distinctive from other regions in Africa.

      title: Rock art in the Horn of Africa
      title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 10'
      body: "The Horn of Africa has historically been a crossroads area between the
        Eastern Sahara, the Subtropical regions to the South and the Arabic Peninsula.
        These mixed influences can be seen in many archaeological and historical features
        throughout the region, the rock art being no exception. Since the early stages
        of research in the 1930s, a strong relationship between the rock art in Ethiopia
        and the Arabian Peninsula was detected, leading to the establishment of the
        term *Ethiopian-Arabian* rock art by Pavel Červiček in 1971. This research
        thread proposes a progressive evolution from naturalism to schematism, ranging
        from the 4th-3rd millennium BC to the near past. Although the *Ethiopian-Arabian*
        proposal is still widely accepted and stylistic similarities between the rock
        art of Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen or Saudi Arabia are undeniable, recent voices
        have been raised against the term because of its excessive generalisation
        and lack of operability. In addition, recent research to the south of Ethiopia
        have started to discover new rock art sites related to those found in Uganda
        and Kenya.\n\nRegarding the main themes of the Horn of Africa rock art, cattle
        depictions seem to have been paramount, with cows and bulls depicted either
        isolated or in herds, frequently associated with ritual scenes which show
        their importance in these communities. Other animals – zebus, camels, felines,
        dogs, etc. –  are also represented, as well as rows of human figures, and
        fighting scenes between warriors or against lions. Geometric symbols are also
        common, usually associated with other depictions; and in some places they
        have been interpreted as tribal or clan marks. Both engraving and painting
        is common in most regions, with many regional variations. \n"

        Rock art in the Horn of Africa faces several challenges. One of them is the lack of consolidated chronologies and absolute dating for the paintings and engravings. Another is the uneven knowledge of rock art throughout the region, with research often affected by political unrest. Therefore, distributions of rock art in the region are steadily growing as research is undertaken in one of the most interactive areas in East Africa.

        The rock art of Central and East Africa is one of the least documented and well understood of the corpus of African rock art. However, in recent years scholars have undertaken some comprehensive reviews of existing sites and surveys of new sites to open up the debates and more fully understand the complexities of this region.

      title: Types of rock art and distribution
      title_internal: 'North Africa: regional, chapter 2'
      body: |+
        Although the styles and subjects of north African rock art vary, there are commonalities: images are most often figurative and frequently depict animals, both wild and domestic. There are also many images of human figures, sometimes with accessories such as recognisable weaponry or clothing. These may be painted or engraved, with frequent occurrences of both, at times in the same context. Engravings are generally more common, although this may simply be a preservation bias due to their greater durability.

        The physical context of rock art sites varies depending on geographical and topographical factors – for example, Moroccan rock engravings are often found on open rocky outcrops, while Tunisia’s Djebibina rock art sites have all been found in rock shelters. Rock art in the vast and harsh environments of the Sahara is often inaccessible and hard to find, and there is probably a great deal of rock art that is yet to be seen by archaeologists; what is known has mostly been documented within the last century.

      body: Although the existence of rock art throughout the Sahara was known to
        local communities, it was not until the nineteenth century that it became
        known to Europeans, thanks to explorers such as Heinrich Barth, who crossed
        the Messak Plateau in Libya in 1850, first noting the existence of engravings.
        Further explorations in the early twentieth century by celebrated travellers,
        ethnographers and archaeologists such as Hassanein Bey, Abbé Breuil, László
        Almásy, Henri Lhote and Leo Frobenius brought the rock art of Sahara, and
        northern Africa in general, to the awareness of a European public.

      body: 'The investigations of these researchers and those who have followed them
        have sought to date and attribute these artworks, with varying measures of
        success. Rock art may be associated with certain cultures through known parallels
        with the imagery in other artefacts, such as Naqada Period designs in Egyptian
        rock art that mirror those on dateable pottery. Authorship may be also guessed
        at through corroborating evidence: for example, due to knowledge of their
        chariot use, and the location of rock art depicting chariots in the central
        Sahara, it has been suggested that it was produced by – or at the same time
        as – the height of the Garamantes culture, a historical ethnic group who formed
        a local power around what is now southern Libya from 500 BC–700 AD. However,
        opportunities to anchor rock art imagery in this way to known ancient cultures
        are few and far between, and rock art is generally ascribed to anonymous hunter-gatherers,
        nomadic peoples, or pastoralists, with occasional imagery-based comparisons
        made with contemporary groups, such as the Fulani peoples.'

        Occasionally, association with writing in the form of, for example, Libyan-Berber or Arabic graffiti can give a known dating margin, but in general, lack of contemporary writing and written sources (Herodotus wrote about the Garamantes) leaves much open to conjecture.

        Other forms of (rare) circumstantial evidence, such as rock art covered by a dateable stratigraphic layer, and (more common) stylistic image-based dating have been used instead to form a chronology of Saharan rock art periods that is widely agreed upon, although dates are contested. The first stage, known as the Early Hunter, Wild Fauna or Bubalus Period, is posited at about 12,000–6,000 years ago, and is typified by naturalistic engravings of wild animals, in particular an extinct form of buffalo identifiable by its long horns.

        Following this is the most widespread style, the Pastoral Period (around 7,500

        of cows, as well as occasional hunting scenes. The Horse Period (around 3,000

        Camel Period (around 2,000 years ago to present) features domestic dromedary
        camels, which we know to have been widely used across the Sahara from that
        time.

        that the area – and the time period in which rock art was produced – is extensive

        Sahara, but there are also regional variations and idiosyncrasies, and a lack
        of evidence that any of these were directly, or even indirectly, related.
        The engravings of weaponry motifs from Morocco and the painted ‘swimming’
        figures of the Gilf Kebir Plateau in Egypt and Sudan are not only completely
        different, but unique to their areas. Being thousands of kilometres apart
        and so different in style and composition, they serve to illustrate the limitations
        inherent in examining northern African rock art as a unit. The contemporary
        political and environmental challenges to accessing rock art sites in countries
        across the Sahara serves as another limiting factor in their study, but as

        The southern African countries of Zimbabwe, South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, Botswana and Namibia contain thousands of rock art sites and southern African rock art has been studied extensively.  Due to perceived similarities in subject matter, even across great distances, much southern African rock art has been ascribed to hunter-gatherer painters and engravers who appear to have had a shared set of cultural references.  These have been linked with beliefs and practices which remain common to modern San|Bushman¹ people, a number of traditional hunter-gatherer groups who continue to live in Southern Africa, principally in Namibia, Botswana and South Africa.  There are, however, differences in style and technique between regions, and various rock art traditions are attributed to other cultural groups and their ancestors.  As is often the case with rock art, the accurate attribution of authorship, date and motivation is difficult to establish, but the rock art of this region continues to be studied and the richness of the material in terms of subject matter, as well as in the context of the archaeological record, has much to tell us, both about its own provenance and the lives of the people who produced it.

        ranging from the rainforests of Mozambique to the arid Namib Desert of western
        Namibia, with the climate tending to become drier towards the south and west.  The
        central southern African plateau is divided by the central dip of the Kalahari
        basin, and bordered by the Great Escarpment, a sharp drop in altitude towards
        the coast which forms a ridge framing much of southern Africa.  The escarpment
        runs in a rough inland parallel to the coastline, from northern Angola, south
        around the Cape and up in the east to the border between Zimbabwe and Malawi.  Both
        painted and engraved rock art is found throughout southern Africa, with the
        type and distribution partially informed by the geographical characteristics
        of the different regions.  Inland areas with exposed boulders, flat rock ‘pavements’
        and rocky outcrops tend to feature engraved rock art, whereas paintings are
        more commonly found in the protective rock shelters of mountainous or hilly
        areas, often in ranges edging the Great Escarpment.  '

      title: Types of rock art
      title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 4'
      body: "Rock art of the type associated with hunter-gatherers is perhaps the
        most widely distributed rock art tradition in southern Africa, with numerous
        known examples in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe, but also with examples
        found in Botswana and Mozambique. This tradition comprises paintings and engravings,
        with both techniques featuring images of animals and people.  The type and
        composition varies from region to region.  For example, rock art sites of
        the southern Drakensberg and Maloti mountains in South Africa and Lesotho
        contain a higher proportion of images of eland antelope, while those in Namibia
        in turn feature more giraffes.  There are also regional variations in style
        and colour: in some sites and areas paintings are polychrome (multi-coloured)
        while in others they are not.\n\nDifferences also occur in composition between
        painting and engraving sites, with paintings more likely to feature multiple
        images on a single surface, often interacting with one another, while engraving
        sites more often include isolated images on individual rocks and boulders.
        \ However, there are commonalities in both imagery and style, with paintings
        throughout southern Africa often including depictions of people, particularly
        in procession and carrying items such as bows and arrows.  Also heavily featured
        in both paintings and engravings are animals, in particular large ungulates
        which are often naturalistically depicted, sometimes in great detail.  Additionally,
        images may include people and animals which appear to have the features of
        several species and are harder to identify.  Some hunter-gatherer type paintings
        are described as ‘fine-line’ paintings because of the delicacy of their rendering
        with a thin brush.  \n"

      body: "Hunter-gatherer rock paintings are found in particular concentrations
        in the Drakensberg-Maloti and Cape Fold Mountains in South Africa and Lesotho,
        the Brandberg and Erongo Mountains in Namibia and the Matobo Hills in Zimbabwe,
        while engraving sites are found throughout the interior, often near water
        courses. \n\nA different form of rock painting from the hunter-gatherer type,
        found mainly in the north-eastern portion of southern Africa is that of the
        ‘late whites’.  Paintings in this tradition are so-called because they are
        usually associated with Bantu language-speaking Iron Age farming communities
        who entered the area from the north from around 2,000 years ago and many of
        these images are thought to have been painted later than some of the older
        hunter-gatherer paintings. ‘Late white’ paintings take many forms, but have
        generally been applied with a finger rather than a brush, and as the name
        suggests, are largely white in colour.  These images represent animals, people
        and geometric shapes, often in quite schematic forms, in contrast to the generally
        more naturalistic depictions of the hunter-gatherer art.  \n\nSometimes ‘late
        white’ art images relate to dateable events or depict objects and scenes which
        could only have taken place following European settlement, such as trains.
        \ Other forms of southern African rock art also depict European people and
        objects.  These include images from the Western Cape in South Africa of a
        sailing ship, estimated to date from after the mid-17th century, as well as
        painted and engraved imagery from throughout South Africa showing people on
        horseback with firearms. Such images are sometimes termed ‘contact art’ as
        their subject matter demonstrates that they follow the period of first contact
        between European and indigenous people.   \n"

        distinct tradition of rock art has been suggested to be of ancestral Khoekhoen

      title: History of research
      title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 6'
      body: 'The first known reports of African rock art outside of the continent
        appear to come from the Bishop of Mozambique, who in 1721 reported sightings
        of paintings on rocks to the Royal Academy of History in Lisbon. Following
        this, reports, copies and publications of rock art from throughout modern
        South Africa were made with increasing frequency by officials and explorers.
        From the mid-19th century onwards, rock art from present-day Namibia, Zimbabwe
        and Botswana began to be documented, and during the first few decades of the
        twentieth century global public interest in the art was piqued by a series
        of illustrated publications. The hunter-gatherer rock art in particular had
        a strong aesthetic and academic appeal to western audiences, and reports,
        photographs and copied images attracted the attention of prominent figures
        in archaeology and ethnology such as Miles Burkitt, Leo Frobenius and the
        Abbé Breuil, researchers whose interest in rock art worldwide let them to
        visit and write about southern African rock art sites.  A further intensification
        of archaeological and anthropological research and recording in the 1950s-70s,
        resulted in new insights into the interpretations and attributions for southern
        African rock art. Rock art research continues throughout the area today.  '

      title: Interpretation
      title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 7'
      body: Rather than showing scenes from daily life, as was once assumed, it is
        now usually accepted that hunter-gatherer art in southern Africa shows images
        and motifs of spiritual and cultural importance. In particular, it is thought
        that some images reflect trance visions of San|Bushman spiritual leaders,
        or shamans,  during which they are considered to enter the world of spirits,
        where they are held to perform tasks for themselves and their communities,
        such as healing the sick or encouraging rain. This interpretation, which has
        been widely accepted, explains certain features of the art, for example the
        predominance of certain animals like eland antelope (due to their special
        cultural significance) and themes such as dot patterns and zigzag lines (interpreted
        as geometric patterns that shamans may see upon entering a trance state).

      title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 8'
      body: "The rock art attributed to ancestral San|Bushman hunter-gatherers has
        many varied motifs, some of which may also relate to specific themes such
        as initiation or rainmaking (indeed within its cultural context one image
        may have several significances).  San|Bushman informants in the 19th century
        told researchers that certain ambiguously shaped animals in the rock art repertoire
        represented animals related to water.  Images such as these are known to researchers
        as 'rain animals' and it has been suggested that certain images could reflect—or
        prompt—the shaman's attempt to control rainfall. Some 'late white' art has
        also been proposed to have associations with rainmaking practices, and indeed
        the proximity of some geometric rock art images, proposed to be of possible
        Khoekhoen origin, to watercourses appears to emphasise the practical and spiritual
        significance of water among historical southern African communities. It has
        also been proposed that some forms of geometric art attributed to Khoekhoen
        people may be linked by tradition and motif to the schematic art traditions
        of central Africa, themselves attributed to hunter-gatherers and possibly
        made in connection with beliefs about water and fertility.  Much in the “late
        white” corpus of paintings appears to be connected to initiation practices,
        part of a larger set of connected traditions extending north as far as Kenya.
        \  \n\nThe long time periods, cultural connections, and movements involved
        can make attribution difficult.  For example, the idiosyncratic rock paintings
        of Tsodilo Hills in Botswana which appear to have similarities with the hunter-gatherer
        style include images of domesticates and may have been the work of herders.
        \ More localised traditions, such as that of engravings in north-western South
        Africa representing the homesteads of ancestral Nguni or Sotho-Tswana language
        speakers, or the focus on engravings of animal tracks found in Namibia, demonstrate
        more specific regional significances.  Research continues and in recent decades,
        researchers, focusing on studying individual sites and sets of sites within
        the landscape and the local historical context, have discussed how their placement
        and subject matter may reflect the shifting balances of power, and changes
        in their communities over time.  \n"

      title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 9'
      body: "Although dating rock art is always difficult, the study of rock art sites
        from southern Africa has benefitted from archaeological study and excavations
        at rock art sites have sometimes revealed useful information for ascribing
        dates.  Some of the oldest reliably dated examples of rock art in the world
        have been found in the region, with the most well-known examples probably
        being the painted plaques from Apollo 11 Cave in Namibia, dated to around
        30,000 years ago.  A portion of an engraved animal found in South Africa’s
        Northern Cape is estimated to be 10,200 years old and painted spalls from
        shelter walls in Zimbabwe have been dated to 12,000 years ago or older.  However,
        it is thought that the majority of existing rock art was made more recently.
        \ As ever, subject matter is also helpful in ascribing maximum date ranges.
        \ We know, for example,that images of domestic animals are probably less than
        2,000 years old.  The condition of the art may also help to establish relative
        ages, particularly with regards to engravings, which may be in some cases
        be categorised by the discolouration of the patina that darkens them over
        time.   \n\nThe multiplicity of rock art sites throughout southern Africa
        form a major component of southern Africa’s archaeological record, with many
        interesting clues about the lives of past inhabitants and, in some cases,
        continuing religious and cultural importance for contemporary communities.
        \ Many sites are open to the public, affording visitors the unique experience
        of viewing rock art in situ.  Unfortunately, the exposed nature of rock art
        in the field leaves it open to potential damage from the environment and vandalism.
        \ Many  major rock art sites in southern Africa are protected by law in their
        respective countries and the Maloti-Drakensberg Park in South Africa and Lesotho,
        Twyfelfontein/ǀUi-ǁAis in Namibia, Tsodilo Hills in Botswana and the Matobo

      body: "¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different
        hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages
        and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive
        terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted
        them."

  title_internal: 'Ethiopia: featured site, chapter 1'
  body: The site of Shepe (also known as Chabbé, Šappe or Mancheti) is located in
    the Sidamo Zone of Oromia, about 250 km to the south of Addis Ababa. The region
    is a fertile, forest-mountainous area traditionally dedicated to the cultivation
    of coffee. The site is in a narrow gorge carved by the Shepe River at 1300 m above
    sea level, full of vegetation and therefore difficult to detect. Along this gorge
    there are several notable  engravings depicted in four panels, forming one of
    the most impressive – if secluded —  rock art sites in the Horn of Africa. The
    site was discovered in 1965 by Fitaorari Selechi Defabatchaw, governor of the
    Dilla district where the site is located, and was published by Francis Anfray
    two years later. Since that, the importance of Shepe has been widely recognized
    and some other sites with similar engravings have been documented in the surrounding
    area. This group (known generically as the Shepe-Galma group) constitutes one
    of the main areas of Ethiopian rock art, the other being the Laga Oda-Sourré group
    in the Harar region.

  title_internal: 'Ethiopia: featured site, chapter 2'
  body: 'The rock art of Shepe consists almost exclusively of engravings of humpless
    cows which follow very strict conventions: profile bodies, small heads with long
    horns seen from above, U-like bellies and udders very clearly depicted. Some of
    the cows have an unidentified, triangular object hanging from their left horn.
    In total, around 50 relatively large cows (40 to 70 cm in length) are depicted
    throughout the gorge walls, distributed in rows and groups to represent herds.
    The most original feature of these engravings is, however, the technique used
    to depict them: rather than carving the outline of the cows, the area around them
    has been lowered to provide a bas-relief effect which has no known parallels in
    the region. The surface of the cows has been polished to obtain a smooth appearance.'

  body: The chronology of the Shepe cows is difficult to determine, but stylistically
    they have been related to the Laga Oda paintings in the area of Harar and to other
    sites in Eritrea and Djibouti. According to most researchers, the Shepe figures
    have been ascribed to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabian style, with a generic chronology
    from the 3rd to the 1st millennia BC. Shepe engravings can be considered relatively
    naturalistic, and therefore should be among the oldest depictions of this style.
    Other interpretations, however, consider Shepe and the nearby sites a completely
    differentiated school whose chronology is still unclear but could be more recent.

  body: Regarding their meaning, only conjecture can be made at present, but it seems
    quite likely that they were made by pastoral communities to whom cattle were fundamental.
    The careful depiction of the udders, the repetition of this single motif and the
    effort paid to achieve the bas-relief effect imply a paramount importance of cattle
    in the economy and society of the group that engraved them. The fact that some
    of the cows have what seem to be adornments hanging from the horns (a feature
    documented in other rock art regions as the Libyan Messak) also points in that
    direction. Contemporary groups, such as the Nuer in nearby Sudan have similar
    traditions of horn adornments, and throughout the Omo river region different techniques
    of embellishment (ear cutting, horn shaping, modifications of the hump) have been
    documented, and in all of them cattle are a key cultural mark as well as an economic
    resource.  Of course, direct links cannot be established between these contemporary
    examples and the communities that made the engravings of Shepe, but the cattle
    depictions in the ravine are nevertheless a document of the importance and consideration
    given to cattle, an animal which was undoubtedly part of these groups’ identity.

  body: Laas Geel, one of the most important rock art sites in the region, is located
    in the north-western part of the Horn of Africa, in Somaliland, in the road that
    links Hargeisa and Berbera. The site is placed on a granite outcrop that rises
    from a plateau at an altitude of 950 meters above sea level, at the confluence
    of two seasonal rivers, a key fact to explain the existence of rock art in the
    outcrop. Even today, the name of the site (“the camel’s well” in Somali) makes
    reference to the availability of water near the surface of the wadis. The panels
    are placed at three different levels and distributed mostly throughout the eastern
    flank of the outcrop, although isolated depictions can be found in other slopes.

  body: The site was discovered in 2002 by a French team led by Xavier Gutherz which
    studied the beginning of Pastoralism in the Horn of Africa. Along with the paintings,
    lithic tools were found scattered throughout the site, and tombs marked with stelae
    and mounds can be seen in the neighbourhood. The paintings are distributed along
    20 rock shelters, the biggest being around 10 meters long. Most of them correspond
    to humpless cows with curved or lyre-like white horns (sometimes with reddish
    tips) and marked udders. Paintings are enormously colourful, including red, white,
    black, violet, brown and yellow both isolated and combined. However, the most
    distinctive feature of these cows is their necks, depicted rectangular, abnormally
    wide and either blank or infilled with red and white stripes, either straight
    or wavy. These strange necks have been interpreted as mats hanging from the actual
    neck, in what could be interpreted as a ceremonial ornament.

    In some cases they carry a bow, a stick or a shield. Along with humans and cows,
    dogs are well represented too, usually positioned near the human figures. Other
    animals are much scarcer: there are some figures that could correspond to antelopes,

    geometric symbols are also represented, often surrounding the cows.'

  body: Unlike many other rock art sites, Laas Geel has been dated quite precisely
    thanks to the excavations carried out in one of the shelters by the French team
    that documented the site. During the excavation parts of the painted rock wall
    were recovered, and therefore the archaeologists have proposed a chronology of
    mid-4th to mid-3rd millennia, being one of the oldest evidences of cattle domestication
    in the Horn of Africa and the oldest known rock art site in this region. Unfortunately,
    although bovine bones were recovered from the excavation, they were too poorly
    preserved to determine whether they correspond to domestic or wild animals.

    As research has increased, some other sites, such as Dhaga Koure, Dhambalin and

    mouth and 12m deep.  The roof slopes sharply to the back towards a raised platform
    against the rear of the left wall, on which 12 images of concentric circles and
    spirals in white and red have been painted. Kwitone has similar paintings, situated
    at one end of a long overhang in a sandstone cliff, below the shoulder of a ridge.  The
    rock art at Kwitone is at the far end on the shelter wall, several metres above
    a cleared floor section. The paintings here feature 11 distinct shapes including
    concentric circles and oblongs. One of these is a prominent sunburst pattern in
    brown, with rays emanating from the outermost band. The images are larger than
    those at Mawanga, averaging around 40cm in diameter, and less faded, exhibiting
    more brown pigment, although both sites appear to reflect the same artistic tradition.
    These are finger paintings, with pigment probably made of haematite or white clay
    mixed with a natural binder such as egg white or urine. There is evidence that
    the surface may also have also been prepared prior to painting, by polishing,
    and that some of the images may have reapplied or retouched over time.

    attributed to people known as the Batwa, a Bantu-origin name for  a series of
    culturally related groups historically living around Africa’s Great Lakes region
    and more widely throughout Central Africa.  Like the San people, who are known
    to have been the creators of most of the famous rock art of Southern Africa, Batwa
    were traditionally hunter-gatherers, and are considered the most ancient indigenous
    populations of the area. In the early 20th century, it was proposed that East
    African rock art of this tradition could have been the work of ancestral San people,
    but it is now generally assumed to be of Batwa origin with, for example, possible
    parallels to be seen in the symbolic iconography with contemporary barkcloth designs
    of the related Mbuti people from the Democratic Republic of Congo (Namono, 2010).

  body: 'The rock art sites of the eastern Lake Victoria region retain spiritual connotations
    for the communities living around them, even if their denoted modern significance
    differs from that envisioned by the original artists. The modern inhabitants of
    Mfangano Island are the Abasuba people, a Bantu language-speaking group unrelated
    to the Batwa who have nevertheless appropriated the sites as arenas of spiritual
    importance.  Members of the Wasamo clan in the area around Mawanga remember their
    having used the site for rain making rituals until a few decades ago, with red
    and white pigment apparently representing the moon and sun respectively.  Soot
    on the cave roof may indicate other recent human activity there. When the archaeologist
    James Chaplin—who first investigated the Kwitone site in the 1960s—visited it
    later, he was told by local Wagimbe clan people that they also held the paintings
    there to be associated with some taboos, and connected it with ancestor worship.
    These beliefs reflect events of the recent past, as the Abasuba only moved into
    the area in the last 400 years.  This followed an earlier occupation by Luo peoples,
    prior to which habitation by the Batwa is assumed. The local importance of the
    sites is highlighted in their stewardship by the Abasuba Peace Museum, which fosters
    a continuing relationship with the sites and those who live around them. '

    the difference in drawing styles signify authorship by different cultures and

    questions difficult to answer, but it seems likely that there was a long tradition
    of painting and engraving here, with much of the ‘pastoralist’ rock art with cattle
    probably made between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago, some earlier styles possibly
    as much as 8,500 years ago, and other images such as camels made only about 2,000

  body: Other than giraffes, the lack of large wild animals depicted (e.g. elephants)
    may indicate the climate to have been too dry for them, as during this time the
    area fluctuated in aridity, eventually becoming desert. There are, however, permanent
    springs at Jebel Uweinat and a more temperate microclimate here may have allowed
    pastoralists to subsist while the surrounding area became inhospitable. Indeed,
    despite its present remoteness, evidence suggests millennia of successive human
    presence, and as recently as the early 20th century, herders of the Toubou peoples
    were reported to be still living in the area. The camel engravings cannot be much
    older than 2,000 years, because camels were unknown in Africa before that, and
    the recent discovery of an ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription from the
    Early Middle Kingdom serves to confirm that Jebel Uweinat has never really been
    ‘undiscovered’, despite having been unknown to Western geographers prior to the
    20th century.

    First documented in 1913 (in the Teso Report&dagger;), the geometric paintings at Nyero are among the most important and well documented rock art sites in Uganda, and are on the Tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage sites&Dagger;.

    Nyero is located in eastern Uganda in the Kumi District, about 200 km from the capital city Kampala.  It comprises six rock shelters in total, but initially only three were recorded and referred to as shrines by local communities, who had no knowledge of the origins of the paintings. The authorship of the paintings remains in some debate.

    Initially, the rock art was thought to be the work of San|Bushmen of southern Africa. However, archaeological, genetic and ethnographic evidence has subsequently attributed the paintings to the ancestors of Batwa people, hunter-gatherers who are descendants of ancient aboriginal groups once spread across East and Central Africa and most probably the original inhabitants of this landscape. Today they live in small groups near the Rwanda/Uganda border.

    More recent studies have proposed that the rock art was the work of settled human groups and not early hunter-gatherers. It has been proposed that rock shelters were used by semi-nomadic peoples devoted to animal herding, and used as reference points in the landscape. Generally positioned away from flat land, they may have served to direct herders of cattle and/or goats towards paths and water. The unknown identity of the rock artists makes dating problematic, but some of the paintings may be up to 12,000 years old.
    Notwithstanding the problems associated with attribution and chronology, many of the rock paintings in Uganda show serious damage due to long exposure to the elements. At Nyero 2, the paintings are partially covered with mineral salts, while at Nyero 5 the paintings have been destroyed or are obscured by rain wash-off. The physical condition of the paintings is testament to their antiquity.

    __Nyero 1__
    This is a small rock shelter on the outer edge of the outcrop and comprises six sets of concentric circles with a central image of a ‘floral motif’ and a so-called ‘acacia pod’ shape. The geometrics in this shelter are all painted in white.

    __Nyero 2__
    This is the main shelter, the overhang of which is formed by an enormous boulder (estimated to weigh at least 20,000 tons) which has broken away; a vertical rock against the back wall measures 10m in height. The panel at Nyero 2 consists of more than forty images such as vertical divided sausage shapes, so-called ‘canoes‘, unidentified faint markings, ‘U’ shapes, lines and dots, with evidence of superimposition; but is dominated by concentric circles. A unique feature of the paintings are the so-called ‘canoes’ or parts of ‘canoes’, so-called because of their resemblance in form. The depictions are all painted in shades of red.

    The paintings are protected from direct rain by the overhang and rocks to the front and sides protect the paintings from the sun, which is likely to have contributed to their preservation. Early users of the shelter placed ritual gifts on its south-eastern side; the tradition of using this space to place money either before or after receiving help from ancestral spirits is continued by the local community.
    As well as the rock art, a bone incised with three concentric circles and four parallel lines, and pieces of prepared ochre were excavated from this site in 1945.  These are the only evidence of prehistoric portable art so far found in Uganda.

    __Nyero 3__
    Located about eight minutes’ walk from Nyero 2, this shelter is formed by a large boulder perched on supporting rocks. Paintings consist of white concentric circles; the outer circles surrounded by double curved designs, between which are double lines divided into small compartments.

    Situated on the top of the hill, this shelter has a good view of the landscape. This site features two red finger-painted outlines of small oval shapes and a slanting L-shape as well as an outlined cross with a small circle below. The painted surface is now subject to severe exfoliation as it is open to the rain and morning sun.

    The sites at Nyero are believed locally to have been sacred ancestral places where, in the past, people would have travelled long distances to make offerings of food, beer and money in times of drought, misfortune and for child birth. Nyero was also regarded as a magical place where rain ceremonies were held. Oral histories have recorded strong attachments to the site and individual and community prayers were held seasonally. The antiquity of the images and their association with long-forgotten peoples may serve to enhance Nyero as a special and sacred place for local communities.

    These skilfully engraved images depict long-horned cattle with their heads bowed. Thought to date between 7,000 and 8,000 years ago, today these images stand alone in a vast wilderness of sand and rock. However, this environment was once wetter and more fertile, and this site may have been close to a local watering hole where animals regularly drank and bathed. Indeed, even today during the rains, the depression in the sand at the base of the inselberg fills up with water, which gives the appearance that the cows are bending their heads to drink.

    These engravings are incorporated in a local myth that tells of a shepherd who engraved the crying cows after travelling night and day with his herd to a spring he thought would quench their thirst. Finding it dry, he captured in stone his cattle’s grief as he watched them die one by one. Climatic data has shown a number of significant cooling events in the North Atlantic, one of which – dating to around eight thousand years ago – resulted in a period of aridity lasting a number of centuries across the Sahara, and may coincide with these engravings and of the associated myth.

  body: In artistic terms, the execution of this panel of engraved cows is extremely
    accomplished and testifies to someone who was not only a skilful carver but who
    we might even regard as a sculptor in the modern sense, who understood both materials
    and the interplay of light and shade in the reductive process of carving. But
    even more than this, the artist understood the environmental conditions in which
    he was working. It has been observed that the depth and thickness of the engraved
    lines has been carefully calculated to ensure that as the sun travels across them
    during the day, they appear to move. This sense of movement is made most acute
    as the evening shadows, falling into each groove, give the cattle a sense of mass
    and movement. Other artistic devices, such as double lines with recessed areas
    and internal polishing, evoke a perception of depth and density. The interplay
    of light and shade is consummately adept and dynamic, and the sculptural quality
    of the image sensorially evocative. This is the work of a practised craftsman,
    who demonstrates a deep of understanding of materials, techniques and the natural
    environment.

    Oukaïmeden is an alpine-like valley set 2,630 metres above sea level at the core of Morocco’s High Atlas. Records from the 16th century onwards refer to its seasonal profit as summer pasturage by herders coming from villages settled at mid-altitude. It is a well-known place due to the existence of a ski resort, and a well-frequented tourist destination for people coming from Marrakech during the summer. It is also home to one of the most impressive collections of rock art engravings in Morocco, with about 250 rock art sites and one thousand depictions scattered throughout the valley.
    Oukaïmeden rock art has been thoroughly studied by Malhome (1959, 1961) and Rodrigue (1999), and along with the Yagour plateau and Jbel Rat constitute the core of High Atlas rock art.

    Although some of the engravings correspond to cattle depictions similar to those
    of nearby regions, there are other images known only in this region. One particular
    type comprises detailed, large human figures represented frontally, surrounded
    by weapons and other symbols. Another common kind of depiction is circular shapes
    with inner designs, which most probably represent shields. Weapons are also very
    common, usually depicted in isolation, but not held by warriors as is common in
    most of the North African images. Together with these themes, Oukaïmeden is characterised
    by a significant number of elephant representations (something surprising considering
    its altitude!) and a huge number of complex, geometric symbols whose interpretation

  title_internal: 'Morocco: featured site, chapter 3'
  body: Chronologically speaking, it seems Oukaïmeden engravings started to appear
    during the mid-3rd millennium BC, when the Sahara desert became increasingly drier
    and summer grazing became more and more important. The earliest depictions consisted
    mainly of animals, especially cattle, which was the species that benefited the
    most from green pastures. As time passed, pressure on this resource grew and tensions
    arose among the communities that used the valley. From the 2nd millennium BC onwards,
    animal depictions were replaced by images of weapons and warriors, showing a different,
    more violent way of reclaiming rights over pastures. That situation continued
    during the long Libyan-Berber period that started around the mid-1st millennium
    BC and lasted until the Muslim conquest of the area, around the 7th century AD.
    The arrival of Islam does not imply the immediate disappearance of rock art engravings,
    but their number decreased significantly and they progressively lost their significance,
    becoming incidental in Oukaïmeden history.

  body: 'Unlike most of the rock art sites in North Africa, Oukaïmeden was not inhabited
    the whole year: the heavy snow that falls during the winter prevented occupation
    during the winter season. But that same snow made the valley a strategic resource
    for the villages placed in the surrounding, lower areas. During summer, when pastures
    became drier in the area around Marrakech, herders would take their sheep and
    cattle to Oukaïmeden for grazing, much in the way as it is still done today.'

    Although Oukaïmeden rock art is distributed throughout the valley, there are some sites with scenes that stand above the rest due to their complexity and significance. One of them is the so-called Elephants’ Frieze, a horizontal rock face where four elephants, a feline, a rhinoceros or warthog and two human figures facing the animals were depicted. Two later, vertical Libyan-Berber inscriptions were added to the panel. The scene is placed near a shelter, facing a stream which constitutes one of the main access routes to the valley grazing areas.

    The relevance of Oukaïmeden rock art is renowned, and the whole area has been protected since 1951 by the Moroccan government, while the National Centre of Rock Art Heritage in Marrakech has carried on several research projects in the area. However, the interest in the site doesn’t mean its preservation is assured: the growing incidence of tourism, the extraction of stones for building purposes in nearby Marrakech and vandalism are threats that have still to be dealt with. The fragile environment of Oukaïmeden valley adds an extra concern about the preservation of one of the most complete and better-preserved rock sites in Morocco.

  body: Running from the Red Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, the Sahara is by far the world's
    largest hot desert. It covers over 3,500,000 square miles (9,000,000 sq. km),
    a tenth of the whole African Continent. Yet we know it was not always so. Archaeological
    and geological research has shown that the Sahara has undergone major climatic
    changes since the end of the last Ice Age (c. 10,000 BC). During this period,
    rain was far more abundant, and vast areas of the current desert were a savannah.
    By around 4,200 BC, changes in the rainfall and seasonal patterns led to a gradual
    desertification of the Sahara into an arid expanse. The analysis of archaeological
    sites, animal bones and preserved vegetal remains tell us of a greener world,
    where some of the earliest attempts at domestication of animals and rudimentary
    farming took place.

    Little is known about the people who lived in the Sahara thousands of years ago; however, through rock art, we can discern who they may have been and what images were important to them. Throughout the desert, rock art engravings and paintings depict an earlier story of the Sahara: the wild animals that lived there; the cattle herds that provided food and labour; their daily activities and beliefs are all displayed in caves and cliffs, valleys or plateaus.

    The Messak Settafet is one of these places. Situated in the Sahara, it is a large plateau running southwest to northeast through the Libyan province of Fezzan, near the borders of Algeria and Niger. Both plateaus are crossed by numerous wadis (dry riverbeds) that run to the east, flanked by cliffs filled with tens of thousands of rock art depictions, including some of the oldest engravings in the Sahara. Rich with depictions of the savannah, the rock art shows buffaloes, crocodiles, ostriches or hippopotami, all of which tells us of a wetter Sahara thousands of years ago.

    It is difficult to determine the motives of the people that created these images. There are many theories about why these people created rock art, what exactly is depicted and what the images meant to that group. One area of particular research interest is the depiction of mythical beings, therianthropic figures (part human part animal) and anthropomorphic animals (the personification of animals in human forms). Were these religious images? Cultural folklore? Or simply images pleasing to a group or culture?

    could also identify them as cat-like figures, although most probably they were
    the representation of mythical beings, considering their prominence above all
    other figures in this area. A polished line comes out from the waist of both figures
    to join four small ostriches, depicted between them, which often accompany rock

    Another example of fighting cats has been found nearby, although it is neither so carefully made nor in such a prominent place. The similarity is, however, astonishing, and we may wonder if this second pair of beings could be a copy of the first pair, thus reflecting its symbolic importance in the people’s collective imagination.

    As is often the case with rock art, the interpretation of these images remains up for discussion. Given the care taken to engrave the images, their technical quality and their dominant position in the landscape, we can gather that these images potentially had deep meaning for the people who created them thousands of years ago, and were possibly meant to be a symbolic as well as a physical landmark for travellers and local people alike. Although the original purpose and meaning have long since been lost, the expressive power of the engravings still remains, allowing us to gain a small view into the world of the people that lived in the Sahara thousands of years ago, when it was a sprawling green savannah.

    Recorded in 1987 by French archaeologist Christian Dupuy, two remarkable life-size engravings of giraffe have generated much interest due to the size, realism and technique of the depictions. The two giraffe, thought to be one large male in front of a smaller female, were engraved on the weathered surface of a sandstone outcrop. The larger giraffe measures 5.4 m from top to toe and combines several techniques of production, including scraping, smoothing and deep engraving of the outlines.

    Each giraffe has an incised line emanating from its mouth or nose, meandering down to a small human figure. This motif is not unusual in Saharan rock art, but its meaning remains a mystery. Interpretations have suggested the line may indicate that giraffe were hunted or even domesticated, or may reflect a religious, mythical or cultural association. It has also been suggested that the lines and human figures were later additions.

    The engravings cannot be seen from ground level; they are only visible by climbing onto the boulder. They are thought to date from between 6,000 and 8,000 years ago – a period known as the Neolithic Subpluvial, when environmental conditions were much wetter and the Sahara was a vast savannah stretching for thousands of miles, able to sustain large mammals such as giraffe. The soft sandstone is likely to have been incised using a harder material such as flint; there are chisels of petrified wood in the surrounding desert sands which would have acted as good tools for abrading and polishing outlines. It is easy to imagine people in the past sitting on the rocky outcrop watching these long-necked, graceful animals and immortalising them in stone for future generations.

    We can only speculate as to why the giraffe was selected for this special treatment. Any number of physical, behavioural, environmental or symbolic factors may have contributed to its significance.

    While the giraffe have taken centre stage at this site because of their size and the skill of the execution, a systematic study of the area has identified 828 further engravings, including 704 zoomorphs (animal forms), 61 anthropomorphs (human forms), and 17 inscriptions of Tifinâgh script. The animals identified include: bovines (cattle ) (46%), ostrich (16%), antelope and gazelle (16%), giraffe (16%), and finally 12 dromedaries (camels), 11 canids (dog-like mammals), 6 rhinoceros, 3 equids (horses or donkeys), 2 monkeys, 2 elephants, and 1 lion.

    Who might the artists have been? It is often the case in rock art research that artists are lost to us in time and we have little or no archaeological evidence that can offer insights into the populations that occupied these sites, sometimes only for a short time. However, in 2001 a site called Gobero was discovered that provides a glimpse of life in this region at the time that the Dabous engravings were produced.

    bovids, small carnivores and crocodiles). Microlithis, bone harpoon points and
    hooks, as well as ceramics with dotted wavy-line and zig-zag impressed motif were

  body: 'Two of the most impressive panels of paintings from Guilemsi involve not
    cattle but another important domesticate: ridden horses. There is evidence of
    horses having reached the far West of North Africa by about 600 AD, but horses
    may have been used in the area much earlier, from the mid-1st Millennium BC, if
    not earlier. Although elsewhere in the Sahara the earliest horse images appear
    to show them used for draught purposes rather than riding, in Mauritania, almost
    all depictions of horses in rock art show them being ridden, often by apparently
    armed riders (eg. Fig. 11). At Guilemsi, there are several styles of paintings
    showing horses and riders: the ‘bi-triangular’ and stick-figure like styles (Figs.
    10 & 11), which have been proposed to be associated with early Berber peoples,
    and another style, showing horses with elongated, stylised bodies and short necks
    (Fig. 9). These horse depictions appear to be of a form thus far unrecorded in
    the rock art of the area, and as such are an interesting addition to the known
    corpus, as Mauritanian rock art has not been as thoroughly studied as that of
    other Saharan countries.'

    to depict a group of armed horsemen, and warriors on foot, vanquishing others
    who are unmounted, who lie, presumably dead, to the left of the horsemen, surrounded
    by spears. This is an unusually dynamic depiction of conflict, and it is not known
    whether it depicts an imagined or real confrontation, or, if real, whether it
    is the work of an artist from the culture of the horsemen or those opposing them.

    It has been suggested that the painting of the horse scenes, in line with similar images from other rock art traditions, may be a cathartic spiritual exercise made, possibly by victims of raids, in response to violent intercultural contact. However as with the other images, without an accurate way of scientifically dating such paintings, it is hard to know exactly when they were painted and therefore difficult to propose of or by whom, much less ascribe motivations. Stone tools and the remains of iron smelting activity at Guilemsi suggest successive occupations, possibly over a long period.

    Stylistic links to other sites may be made, however: despite the fact that some of the iconography at Guilemsi appears quite unique, other elements, such as the bichrome cow in Fig. 6, and other square figures at Guilemsi of a man and giraffe, have similar looking counterparts in the Tichitt region, while the “bi-triangular” horses are found elsewhere in the Tagant and Adrar regions of Mauritania, and even as far away as Chad. Understanding of these links is still nascent, as is the interpretation of most Mauritanian rock art, but the variety present at Guilemsi is a valuable addition to the record, and more such sites may remain to be brought to the notice of scholars.

    Chad, an impressive sandstone massif eroded by wind and temperature changes into
    series of terraces, gorges, cliffs and outliers. Although it is part of the Sahara,
    the climate of the Ennedi Plateau is much more suitable for human habitation than
    most of the desert, with regular rain during summer, wadis (seasonal rivers) flowing
    once or twice a year, and a relatively large range of flora and fauna – including
    some of the few remaining populations of Saharan crocodiles west of the Nile.
    Throughout the caves, canyons and shelters of the Ennedi Plateau, thousands of
    images – dating from 5000 BC onwards – have been painted and engraved, comprising
    one of the biggest collections of rock art in the Sahara and characterised by
    a huge variety of styles and themes.

  body: 'Within this kaleidoscope, a series of engravings have become especially renowned
    for their singularity and quality: several groups of life-sized human figures
    depicted following very regular stylistic conventions. They were first reported
    internationally in the early 1950s; during the following decades more sites were
    discovered, almost all of them around Wadi Guirchi, and especially near a site
    known as Niola Doa. To date, six sites have been documented, totalling about 40
    depictions. Most of the figures were engraved on big, vertical boulders, in groups,
    although occasionally they appear isolated. They follow a very regular pattern:
    most of them are life-sized or even bigger and are represented upright facing
    right or left, with one arm bent upwards holding a stick resting over the neck
    or shoulder and the other arm stretched downwards. In some cases, the figures
    have an unidentified, horizontal object placed at the neck, probably an ornament.
    Interspersed among the bigger figures, there are smaller versions which are slightly
    different, some of them with the arms in the same position as the others but without
    sticks, and some facing forwards with hands on hips. In general, figures seem
    to be naked, although in some cases the smaller figures are depicted with skirts.'

    In addition, almost all the figures are decorated with intricate geometric patterns (straight and wavy lines, squares, meanders and, in one case, schematic birds), which could be interpreted as garments, tattoos, scarifications or body paintings. In some cases, figures appear simply outlined, but these very rare cases were probably left unfinished. The decorative patterns extend to the ears, which are always depicted with geometric designs, and to the head, where these designs could correspond to hairstyles.

    The decorative richness of the Niola Doa engravings has led to their interpretation as ritual scenes, probably special occasions when body decoration was part of a more complex set of activities with dancing or singing. On some occasions, comparisons have been established between the geometric designs of Niola Doa and different types of body decorations (body painting, scarifications). Scarifications, in particular, have a long tradition within some African cultures and in many cases parallels have been documented between this kind of body decoration and material culture (i.e. pottery, pipes, wood sculptures or clothes). The relative proximity of groups with well-known traditions of scarifications and body painting has led to comparisons which, although suggested, cannot be wholly proved.

    at the Ennedi Plateau is assumed to be much newer, up to the 5th or 4th millennium
    BC. These engravings could, therefore, correspond to what has been called the
    Archaic Period in this area, although a Pastoral Period chronology has also been
    proposed. In several other sites around the Ennedi Plateau, similar images have
    been painted, although whether these images are contemporary with those of Niola
    Doa or correspond to a different period is unclear. Regardless of their chronology,
    what is undeniable is the major impact these depictions had on later generations

  body: |-
    The rock art of Eastern Africa is characterised by a wide range of non-figurative images, broadly defined as geometric. Occurring in a number of different patterns or designs, they are thought to have been in existence in this region for thousands of years, although often it is difficult to attribute the art to particular cultural groups. Geometric rock art is difficult to interpret, and designs have been variously associated with sympathetic magic, symbols of climate or fertility and altered states of consciousness (Coulson and Campbell, 2010:220). However, in some cases the motifs painted or engraved on the rock face resemble the same designs used for branding livestock and are intimately related to people’s lives and world views in this region.

    First observed in Kenya in the 1970s with the work of Gramly (1975) at Lukenya Hill and Lynch and Robbins (1977) at Namoratung’a, some geometric motifs seen in the rock art of the region were observed to have had their counterparts on the hides of cattle of local communities. Although cattle branding is known to be  practised by several Kenyan groups, Gramly concluded that  “drawing cattle brands on the walls of rock shelters appears to be confined to the regions formerly inhabited by the Maa-speaking pastoralists or presently occupied by them”&dagger;(Gramly, 1977:117).

  body: In the case of Lukenya Hill, the rock shelters on whose walls these geometric
    symbols occur are associated with meat-feasting ceremonies. Meat-feasting shelters
    exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are places where
    Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat in their homes,
    gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle. During or after feasting,
    symbols of the animals that had been eaten were painted on the shelter ceiling
    in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand their cattle and camels with symbols
    that signify the lineage of their owners, but may also indicate if an animal has
    been treated for a particular disease. Different symbols may be used for male
    and female animals.

    Some of these motifs bear a striking resemblance to the brand marks that the Turkana
    mark on their cattle, camels, donkeys and other livestock in the area, although

  title_internal: 'Geometric motifs: thematic, chapter 4'
  body: Recent research (Russell, 2013) has shown that at Namoratung’a the branding
    of animals signifies a sense of belonging rather than a mark of ownership as we
    understand it in a modern farming context; all livestock, cattle, camel, goats,
    sheep and donkeys are branded according to species and sex (Russell, 2013:7).
    Ethnographic accounts document that clan membership can only be determined by
    observing someone with their livestock (Russell, 2013:9). The symbol itself is
    not as important as the act of placing it on the animal’s skin, and local people
    have confirmed that they never mark rock with brand marks. Thus, the geometric
    motifs on the grave markers may have been borrowed by local Turkana to serve as
    identity markers, but in a different context. In the Horn of Africa, some geometric
    rock art is located in the open landscape and on graves. It has been suggested
    that these too are brand or clan marks, possibly made by camel keeping pastoralists
    to mark achievement, territory or ownership (Russell, 2013:18). Some nomadic pastoralists,
    further afield, such as the Tuareg, place their clan marks along the routes they
    travel, carved onto salt blocks, trees and wells (Mohamed, 1990; Landais, 2001).

  body: "However, not all pastoralist geometric motifs can be associated with meat-feasting
    or livestock branding; they may have wider symbolism or be symbolic of something
    else (Russell, 2013:17).  For example, informants from the Samburu people reported
    that while some of the painted motifs found at Samburu meat-feasting shelters
    were of cattle brands, others represented female headdresses or were made to mark
    an initiation, and in some Masai shelters there are also clear representations
    of warriors’ shields.  In Uganda, a ceremonial rock in Karamoja, shows a dung
    painting consisting of large circles bisected by a cross which is said to represent
    cattle enclosures (Robbins, 1972). Geometric symbols, painted in fat and red ochre,
    on large phallic-shaped fertility stones on the Mesakin and Korongo Hills in south
    Sudan indicate the sex of the child to whom prayers are offered (Bell, 1936).
    A circle bisected by a line or circles bisected by two crosses represent boys.
    Girls are represented by a cross (drawn diagonally) or a slanting line (like a
    forward slash)(Russell, 2013: 17).\n\nAlthough pastoralist geometric motifs are
    widespread in the rock art of eastern Africa, attempting to find the meaning behind
    geometric designs is problematic. The examples discussed here demonstrate that
    motifs can have multiple authors, even in the same location, and that identical
    symbols can be the products of very different behaviours. \n"

    and some Phoenician signs, which would be complemented with indigenous symbols.
    Although none of these theories can be fully accepted or refuted at the present

    which a generic term of Libyco-Berber is used. Furthermore, Tifinagh script, the
    modern script of Tuareg people shares some symbols with the Libyco-Berber alphabet,
    but otherwise is a quite different language. Contemporary Tuareg cannot understand
    the old Libyco-Berber inscriptions although they recognize some symbols. Chronology
    represents another challenge: although the first dated inscription on a *stela*
    is from 138 BC, some pottery sherds with Libyco-Berber symbols could date from
    the 3rd century BC. For some researchers the oldest date (as old as the 7th century
    BC) is believed to correspond to an engraving located in the Moroccan High Atlas,
    although that theory is still under discussion. Finally, the characteristics of
    the scripts present some problems: they are usually short, repetitive and in many
    cases incomplete. Moreover, Libyco-Berber can be written in different directions

    First of all, they normally used only consonants, although due to the influence
    of Punic (the language used in areas controlled or influenced by Carthage) and
    Latin, vowels were added in some alphabet variants. The translation of Libyco-Berber
    scripts is complicated, since the existing texts are very short and can only be
    translated through comparison with equivalent texts in Punic or Latin. Most of
    the translated scripts are very simple and correspond to personal and site names,
    or fixed formulations as “X son of Y”, characteristics of funerary epigraphy,
    or others such as, “It’s me, X”.  Perhaps surprisingly, some of the translated
    inscriptions have an amorous meaning, with expressions as “I, X, love Y”. As the
    known Libyco-Berber corpus of inscriptions grows, it seems possible that more
    and more inscriptions will be translated, leading to a better understanding of
    the languages.

    by Carthage and Rome, resulting in the existence of bilingual inscriptions that
    were the key to the translation of Libyco-Berber scripts. After Roman conquest,
    Libyco-Berber was progressively abandoned as a written language in the area, but
    inscriptions in the Sahara were still common until an unknown moment in the first
    millennium BC (the scripts sometimes receiving the name of Tifinagh). The Berber
    language, however, has been preserved and a new alphabet was developed in the
    1960s to be used by Berber people.

  body: The many challenges that surround the study of Libyco-Berber scripts have
    led to a complex crossroads of terms, chronologies and theories which sometimes
    are contradictory and confusing.  For the Rock Art Image Project, a decision had
    to be made to define the painted or engraved scripts in the collection and the
    chosen term was Libyco-Berber, as most of the images are associated with paintings
    of the Horse and Camel periods and thus considered to be up to 3,000 years old.
    Using the term Tifinagh could lead to misunderstandings with more modern scripts
    and the alphabet currently used by Berber peoples throughout North Africa.

  body: Undoubtedly, the deciphering of forgotten languages captures the imagination
    and is one of the most exciting challenges in the study of ancient cultures. However,
    it is usually a difficult enterprise, as extraordinary finds which aid translation
    such as the Rosetta Stone are fairly exceptional and most of the time the transcription
    and translation of these languages is a long and difficult process in which the
    meaning of words and grammar rules is slowly unravelled. Although there are no
    shortcuts to this method, there are some initiatives that help to ease the task.
    One of them is making available catalogues of high quality images of inscriptions
    which can be studied and analysed by specialists. In that sense, the Libyco-Berber
    inscriptions present in the Rock Art Image Project catalogue can be truly helpful
    for all those interested in one of the most fascinating languages in the world;
    a language, which albeit modified  has endured in different forms for hundreds
    of years.

    Africa, such as the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela, the Axumite kingdom monoliths
    or the Gondar palaces. Most of these sites are located in northern Ethiopia, but
    to the south of the country there are also some remarkable archaeological remains,

    and the 10th centuries AD, the area with the highest concentration of stelae is
    to the south-west of the country, from the Manz region to the north of Addis Ababa
    to the border with Kenya. It is a extensive area which approximately follows the
    Rift Valley and the series of lakes that occupy its floor, and which roughly covers
    the Soddo, Wolayta and Sidamo regions. The region has a tropical climate and is
    fertile, with warm conditions being predominant and rainfall being quite abundant,
    with annual rates of 1200-1500 mm in the lower areas while in the highlands the
    rainfall reaches 2.000 mm per year.

  body: 'Ethiopian stelae have been known to western scholars since the end of the
    19th century, with the first examples documented in 1885 to the north of Addis
    Ababa and the news about the main group to the south arriving in 1905. The first
    archaeological works in the southern area took place in the 1920’s carried on
    by French and German researchers. The work of Père Azaïs was especially remarkable,
    with four expeditions undertaken between 1922 and 1926 which were partially published
    in 1931. Along with Azaïs, a German team from the Frobénius Institute started
    to study the site of Tuto Fela, a huge cemetery with hundreds of phallic and anthropomorphic
    stelae located in the Sidamo region. Since these early studies the archaeological
    remains were left unattended until the 1970’s, when Francis Anfray excavated the
    site of Gattira-Demma and organized a far more systematic survey in the area which
    documented dozens of stelae of different sizes and types. In the 1980’s, another
    French team started to study first Tiya and then Tuto Fela and another important
    site, Chelba-Tutitti, in a long-term project which has been going on for thirty
    years and has been paramount to understand the types, chronologies and distribution
    of these archaeological remains. The historical importance of these stelae was
    universally recognized in 1980, when Tiya was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage
    Site. '

  body: 'The Ethiopian stelae show a great variability in shapes and decorations,
    but at least three main groups could be defined. The first corresponds to the
    so-called phallic stelae, long cylindrical stones with a hemispherical top delimited
    by a groove or ring (Jossaume 2012: 97). The body of the stela is sometimes decorated
    with simple geometric patterns. A second type is known as anthropomorphic, with
    the top of the piece carved to represent a face and the rest of the piece decorated
    with crossed patterns. These two types are common to the east of the Rift Valley
    lakes, while to the south of Addis Ababa and to the west of these lakes several
    other types are present, most of them representing anthropomorphs but sometimes
    plain instead of cylindrical. These figures are usually classified depending on
    the shape and especially the features engraved on them –masks, pendants, swords-
    with the most lavishly carved considered the most recent. Probably the best known
    group is that with swords represented, such as those of Tiya, characterized by
    plain stones in which groups of swords (up to nineteen) are depicted along with
    dots and other unidentified symbols. Not all the stelae have these weapons, although
    those that don’t are otherwise identical in shape and have other common signs
    engraved on them.  Regarding their chronology the Ethiopian stela seem to be relatively
    new, dated from the 10th to the 13th centuries, sometimes with one type of stela
    superimposed on another and in other cases with old types being reused in later
    tombs.'

    a funerary function, marking the tombs of deceased which were buried in cemeteries
    sometimes reaching hundreds of graves. The information collected from sites of
    such as Tuto Fela show that not all the burials had an attached stela, and considering
    the amount of work necessary to prepare them those which had could be interpreted
    as belonging to high status people. In some cases, such as in Tiya, it seems evident
    that the stela marked the graves of important personalities within their communities.
    It is difficult to determine who the groups that carved these stelae were, but
    given their chronology it seems that they could have been Cushitic or Nilotic-speaking
    pastoralist communities absorbed by the Oromo expansion that took place in the
    sixteenth century. A lot of research has still to be done about these graveyards
    and their associated living spaces, and undoubtedly many groups of stelae are
    yet to be discovered. Those studied show, however, the potential interest of ancient
    communities still poorly known but which were able to develop complex societies
    and these material expressions of authority and power. '

  title: Introduction
  title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 1'
  body: Ethiopia is the biggest country of the Horn of Africa, a very diverse country
    which has traditionally been a melting pot of cultures, religions and ethnicities,
    acting as a crossroads between the Nile valley region, the Red Sea and East Africa.
    Most rock art is located in the southern part of the country, although smaller
    concentrations have been documented near the borders with Eritrea, Sudan and Kenya.
    Ethiopian rock art shows strong similarities with other countries in the Horn
    of Africa as well as Sudan and mostly consists of cow depictions dated from the
    3rd millennium onwards, although other animals, anthropomorphic figures and geometric
    symbols are also fairly common.

  title: Geography and rock art distribution
  title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 2'
  body: The geography of Ethiopia is varied and ranges from high plateaus to savannahs
    and deserts.   The eastern part mostly consists of a range of plateaus and high
    mountains, which in some cases reach more than 4000m above sea level. To the north
    of these mountains is Lake Tana, the biggest lake in Ethiopia and the source of
    the Blue Nile, one of the two tributaries of the Nile. The mountains are divided
    in two by the Great Rift Valley, which runs north-east to south-west, - and is
    one of the most important areas for the study of human evolution. The highlands
    are surrounded by tropical savannah and grassland regions to the west and south-west,
    while to the east lays the Danakil desert, one of the most inhospitable regions
    on earth. The south-eastern corner of Ethiopia, which borders Somalia, is a semi-desert
    plateau ranging from 300-1500 m above sea level.

  body: 'Ethiopian rock art is located around two main areas: around the city of Harar
    to the east and the Sidamo region to the south-west. The first group comprises
    mainly painted depictions, while the second one is characterized by a bas-relief
    technique specific only to this area. However, rock art has also been discovered
    in other areas, such as the border with Eritrea, the area near Kenya and the Benishangul-Gumuz
    region, a lowland area along the border with Sudan. As research increases, it
    is likely that more rock art sites will be discovered throughout the country.
    In addition to these engravings and paintings, Ethiopia is also known for its
    decorated stelae, tall stone obelisks that are usually engraved with culturally
    and religiously important symbols. One of these places is Tiya, a burial place
    declared a World Heritage Site which has 32 richly decorated stelae. Although
    not strictly rock art in the traditional sense, they nevertheless represent one
    of the most interesting group of archaeological remains in the south of Ethiopia
    and demonstrate similar techniques to some of the engraved depictions.'

  title: Research history
  title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 4'
  body: Ethiopian rock art has played a key role in the Horn of Africa research, and
    the studies undertaken in this country have structured the chronologies, styles
    and interpretations of the whole region. Research started as early as the mid-1930s
    when the Abbé Henri Breuil proposed a classification of Ethiopian rock art through
    the study of the Porc-Epic and Genda-Biftou sites. This proposal stated a progressive
    evolution in eight steps from naturalism to schematism, and set the interpretative
    framework for succeeding decades. Breuil’s ideas were generally followed by John
    Desmond Clark in his synthesis of the rock art in the Horn of Africa in 1954,
    and they also appear in the work of Paolo Graziosi (1964). During the 1960s, research
    was carried out by Francis Anfray in the Sidamo area and by Gerard Bailloud near
    Harar, where a report made for the Ethiopian government informed about the existence
    of around ten rock art sites in the same area.

  body: Rock art research in Ethiopia has traditionally included the term Ethiopian-Arabian
    style, coined in 1971 by Červiček to show the similarities between the depictions
    found in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The existence of this style
    is currently the paradigm used in most rock art interpretations of the region,
    although some concerns have been raised due to its too generic characteristics,
    which can be found in many other parts of Africa.  The 1990s and 2000s have seen
    a remarkable increase of rock art research in the country, with the renewal of
    studies in the main areas and the beginning of research in the regions of Tigray
    and Benishangul-Gumuz.

  title: Themes
  title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 6'
  body: Cattle and cattle-related depictions are the main subject of Ethiopian rock
    art, regardless of their relative chronology. The oldest depictions (based on
    Červiček’s works) are of humpless cows, while in the late stages of rock art humped
    cows and camels appear. Goats, sheep and dogs are very occasionally depicted,
    and unlike the Saharan rock art, wild animals such as giraffes and antelopes are
    scarce. Figures of cattle appear alone or in herds, and the depictions of cows
    with calves are a fairly common motif not only in Ethiopia but in the whole Horn
    of Africa.

  title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 7'
  body: The other main group of depictions is of anthropomorphs, which are usually
    schematic and often distributed in rows. In some cases, the tendency to schematism
    is so pronounced that human figures are reduced to an H-like shape. Sometimes,
    human figures are represented as warriors, carrying weapons and on occasion fighting
    against other humans or big felines. Along with these figurative themes, geometric
    signs are very common in Ethiopian rock art, including groups of dots and other
    motifs that have been interpreted as symbols associated with groups that historically
    lived in the region.

  body: 'Not all themes are distributed in every area. In Sidamo, almost all figures
    depict humpless cows, while subjects in the Harar region show a far bigger variability.
    Again, differences in techniques are also evident: while depictions in the Harar
    region are mainly paintings, in Sidamo many figures are engraved in a very singular
    way, lowering the area around the figures to achieve a bas-relief effect. The
    clear differences between the Sidamo engravings (known as the Chabbé-Galma group)
    and those of the Harar (the Laga Oda-Sourré group) have led to criticisms about
    the perceived uniformity of the *Ethiopian-Arabian* style.'

  title: Chronology
  title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 9'
  body: As is the case with most African rock art, absolute dates for depictions based
    on radiocarbon techniques are scarce, and therefore most of the chronological
    framework of Ethiopian rock art has to rely on the analysis of figures, superimpositions,
    parallels with depictions of better known areas and other indirect dating methods.
    In Ethiopian rock art it is generally assumed that the oldest depictions could
    be dated to the mid-third millennium BC, according to parallels with other Saharan
    rock art. As aforementioned, the so-called Ethiopian-Arabian style shows an evolution
    from naturalism to schematism, with an older group (Sourré-Hanakiya) showing strong
    similarities with rock art in Egypt, Sudan and Libya. A second, progressively
    schematic group (Dahtami) would last until the end of the first millennium BC.
    This date is supported by the appearance of camels and humped cows (zebus), which
    were introduced in the region at the end of the second half of the 1st millennium
    BC. The last stages of Ethiopian rock art relating to camel, warriors and geometric
    depictions can be considered to belong to the historical period, in some cases
    reaching very near to the present day.

  title: Central and East Africa
  title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 1'
  body: |-
    Central Africa is dominated by vast river systems and lakes, particularly the Congo River Basin. Characterised by hot and wet weather on both sides of the equator, central Africa has no regular dry season, but aridity increases in intensity both north and south of the equator. Covered with a forest of about 400,000 m² (1,035,920 km²), it is one of the greenest parts of the continent.  The rock art of central Africa stretches from the Zambezi River to the Angolan Atlantic coast and reaches as far north as Cameroon and Uganda. Termed the ‘schematic rock art zone’ by Desmond Clark (1959), it is dominated by finger-painted geometric motifs and designs, thought to extend back many thousands of years.

    Eastern Africa, from the Zambezi River Valley to Lake Turkana, consists largely of a vast inland plateau with the highest elevations on the continent, such as Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m above sea level) and Mount Kenya (5,199 m above sea level). Twin parallel rift valleys run through the region, which includes the world’s second largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria. The climate is atypical of an equatorial region, being cool and dry due to the high altitude and monsoon winds created by the Ethiopian Highlands. The rock art of eastern Africa is concentrated on this plateau and consists mainly of paintings that include animal and human representations. Found mostly in central Tanzania, eastern Zambia and Malawi; in comparison to the widespread distribution of geometric rock art, this figurative tradition is much more localised, and found at just a few hundred sites in a region of less than 100km in diameter.

  title: History of research
  title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 3'
  body: |-
    The rock art of East Africa, in particular the red paintings from Tanzania, was extensively studied by Mary and Louis Leakey in the 1930s and 1950s. Eric Ten Raa observed Sandawe people of Tanzania making rock paintings in the mid-20th century, and on the basis of oral traditions argued that the rock art was made for three main purposes: casual art; magic art (for hunting purposes or connected to health and fertility) and sacrificial art (to appease ancestral spirits). Subsequently, during the 1970s Fidelis Masao and Emmanuel Anati recorded numerous sites, classifying the art in broad chronological and stylistic categories, proposing tentative interpretations with regard to meaning.

    There has much debate and uncertainty about Central African rock art.  The history of the region has seen much mobility and interaction of cultural groups and understanding how the rock art relates to particular groups has been problematic. Pioneering work in this region was undertaken by Margaret Metcalfe in central Malawi in the early 1920s, Clarence van Riet Lowe visited Zambia in 1936 and attempted to provide a chronological sequence and some insight into the meaning of the rock art. Since the 1950s (Clarke, 1959), archaeologists have attempted to situate rock art within broader archaeological frameworks in order to resolve chronologies, and to categorise the art with reference to style, colour, superimposition, subject matter, weathering, and positioning of depictions within the panel (Phillipson, 1976). Building on this work, our current understanding of rock in this region has been advanced by Benjamin Smith (1995, 1997, 2001) with his work in Zambia and Malawi.

  body: "Zambian rock art does not share any similarities with Tanzanian rock art
    and can be divided into two categories; animals (with a few depictions of humans),
    and geometric motifs. Animals are often highly stylised and superimposed with
    rows of dots. Geometric designs include, circles, some of which have radiating
    lines, concentric circles, parallel lines and ladder shapes. Predominantly painted
    in red, the remains of white pigment is still often visible. David Phillipson
    (1976) proposed that the naturalistic animals were earlier in date than geometric
    designs. Building on Phillipson’s work, Benjamin Smith studied ethnographic records
    and demonstrated that geometric motifs were made by women or controlling the weather.\n\n*__Pastoralist
    paintings__*: \nPastoralist paintings are rare, with only a few known sites in
    Kenya and other possible sites in Malawi. Usually painted in black, white and
    grey, but also in other colours, they include small outlines, often infilled,
    of cattle and are occasional accompanied by geometric motifs. Made during the
    period from 3,200 to 1,800 years ago the practice ceased after Bantu language
    speaking people had settled in eastern Africa. Similar paintings are found in
    Ethiopia but not in southern Africa, and it has been assumed that these were made
    by Cushitic or Nilotic speaking groups, but their precise attribution remains
    unclear (Smith, 2013:154).\n"

    *__Late White Paintings__*:
    Commonly painted in white, or off-white with the fingers, so-called ‘Late White’ depictions include quite large crudely rendered representations of wild animals, mythical animals, human figures and numerous geometric motifs. These paintings are attributed to Bantu language speaking, iron-working farmers who entered eastern Africa about 2,000 years ago from the west on the border of Nigeria and Cameroon. Moving through areas occupied by the Batwa it is thought they learned the use of symbols painted on rock, skin, bark cloth and in sand. Chewa peoples, Bantu language speakers who live in modern day Zambia and Malawi claim their ancestors made many of the more recent paintings which they used in rites of passage ceremonies.

    *__Meat-feasting paintings__*:
    Meat-feasting shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle. The term Maa relates to a group of closely related Eastern Nilotic languages, which historically dominated the east African hinterland; and today is spoken by around a million people. During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners, but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease. Different symbols may be used for male and female animals. Over the centuries, because the depictions are on the ceiling of meat feasting rock shelters, and because sites are used even today, a build-up of soot has obscured or obliterated the paintings. Unfortunately, few have been recorded or mapped.

  title: 'Categories: CENTRAL AFRICA'
  title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 7'
  body: The rock art of central Africa is attributed to hunter-gatherers known as
    Batwa. This term is used widely in eastern central and southern Africa to denote
    any autochthonous hunter-gatherer people. The rock art of the Batwa can be divided
    into two categories which are quite distinctive stylistically from the Tanzanian
    depictions of the Sandawe and Hadza. Nearly 3,000 sites are currently known from
    within this area. The vast majority, around 90%, consist of finger-painted geometric
    designs; the remaining 10% include highly stylised animal forms (with a few human
    figures) and rows of finger dots. Both types are thought to date back many thousands
    of years. The two traditions co-occur over a vast area of eastern and central
    Africa and while often found in close proximity to each other are only found together
    at a few sites. However, it is the dominance of geometric motifs that make this
    rock art tradition very distinctive from other regions in Africa.

  title: Rock art in the Horn of Africa
  title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 10'
  body: "The Horn of Africa has historically been a crossroads area between the Eastern
    Sahara, the Subtropical regions to the South and the Arabic Peninsula. These mixed
    influences can be seen in many archaeological and historical features throughout
    the region, the rock art being no exception. Since the early stages of research
    in the 1930s, a strong relationship between the rock art in Ethiopia and the Arabian
    Peninsula was detected, leading to the establishment of the term *Ethiopian-Arabian*
    rock art by Pavel Červiček in 1971. This research thread proposes a progressive
    evolution from naturalism to schematism, ranging from the 4th-3rd millennium BC
    to the near past. Although the *Ethiopian-Arabian* proposal is still widely accepted
    and stylistic similarities between the rock art of Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen or
    Saudi Arabia are undeniable, recent voices have been raised against the term because
    of its excessive generalisation and lack of operability. In addition, recent research
    to the south of Ethiopia have started to discover new rock art sites related to
    those found in Uganda and Kenya.\n\nRegarding the main themes of the Horn of Africa
    rock art, cattle depictions seem to have been paramount, with cows and bulls depicted
    either isolated or in herds, frequently associated with ritual scenes which show
    their importance in these communities. Other animals – zebus, camels, felines,
    dogs, etc. –  are also represented, as well as rows of human figures, and fighting
    scenes between warriors or against lions. Geometric symbols are also common, usually
    associated with other depictions; and in some places they have been interpreted
    as tribal or clan marks. Both engraving and painting is common in most regions,
    with many regional variations. \n"

    Rock art in the Horn of Africa faces several challenges. One of them is the lack of consolidated chronologies and absolute dating for the paintings and engravings. Another is the uneven knowledge of rock art throughout the region, with research often affected by political unrest. Therefore, distributions of rock art in the region are steadily growing as research is undertaken in one of the most interactive areas in East Africa.

    The rock art of Central and East Africa is one of the least documented and well understood of the corpus of African rock art. However, in recent years scholars have undertaken some comprehensive reviews of existing sites and surveys of new sites to open up the debates and more fully understand the complexities of this region.

  title: Pictographs - Painting
  title_internal: 'General: how made, chapter 2'
  body: The pigments used in paintings are dependent on local resources, but typically
    have been made of minerals such as ochre that comes in a variety of red, brown
    and yellow hues. White is derived from silica, china clay and gypsum and black
    is obtained from manganese minerals, charcoal or specularite. Once collected these
    minerals were ground to form a powder and mixed with liquids such as egg albumen,
    urine, blood, saliva or water to make the pigment easier to apply and to act as
    a binding agent. Current research is exploring new methods to be able to date
    these ingredients. A variety of tools have been used to apply the pigment onto
    rock surfaces including birds’ feathers, animal hair, grasses or reeds and fingers.
    This process is not simply a technological one, and for many cultural groups the
    pigment itself and the method of application are imbued with symbolic meaning.

  title: Petroglyphs – Engraving
  title_internal: 'General: how made, chapter 4'
  body: Three techniques were generally used to remove the rock surface; incising/engraving
    (lines are cut into the rock with a sharp tool); pecking (hammering and chipping
    away at the rock surface) and scraping. Rock faces were sometimes ‘prepared’ by
    scraping, allowing for an improved surface on which to inscribe the image. Incising
    or engraving involves scratching into the stone surface using a sharp lithic flake
    or metal blade. Pecking is a form of indirect percussion whereby a second rock
    is used like a chisel between the hammerstone and the rock face, while scraping
    is created using a hard hammerstone, which is battered against the rock surface.
    A last, much rarer method of engraving is the bas-relief technique, where the
    area around the image is lowered (usually by polishing) thus making the figure
    raise over the surface.

    a partial picture of the inconsistent and contested chronological records of rock
    art in Africa. For example, where research has focused on interpretation, chronology
    has been less prominent and as such the capacity for judging meaningful relationships
    between sites and imagery has been inhibited; by contrast where chronologies have
    led research agendas, the temporal and spatial relationships are much clearer,
    but chronologies are hotly disputed. A significant obstacle is the challenge in
    directly dating rock art, and current research is exploring ways forward in refining
    these techniques. Here, we give an overview of dating methods and developed chronologies

  title_internal: 'General: chronologies, chapter 3'
  body: |-
    Relative chronologies aim to organise the images from the oldest to the more recent, even if their exact dates are not known, providing the relative position of groups of depictions over time. It uses methods such as the analysis of superimpositions (the figures on the top have to be younger than those underneath), the study of depictions of animals already extinct or newly introduced in areas (for example, camels in the Sahara) or objects that have a known timeframe of usage, such as ships, firearms, chariots, etc.

    In some cases, graffiti can be found alongside figures, and linguistic studies can help to determine the age of both texts and depictions. Of course, one of the best ways to establish a relative date for rock art is when it is covered by archaeological deposits that can be dated through radiocarbon methods or archaeological materials. However, that date only states the minimum age of the rock art depictions, as they could have been covered hundreds or thousands of years after the images were painted or engraved. Moreover, these situations are very rare, as most of the time rock art is situated in the open air, without associated archaeological sites.

    this could seem the perfect solution for the dating of paintings, the methods
    of absolute dating can only be used in very specific contexts, and often have
    serious problems of accuracy and reliability. The most efficient is based on the
    radiocarbon (carbon-14) method, measuring the amount of carbon remaining in pigments,
    although in many depictions the remnants of paint are so sparse that the size
    of the samples is too low to be measured. Besides, this method is destructive,
    as part of the painting has to be removed from the original site to collect the
    sample.

    that affect their surface after they were made. The most obvious is a progressive
    change in colour, making the older engravings seems “darker” than the newer. When
    the changes in colour are due to chemical, internal processes, the term used is
    *patina*, while when they are caused by the accumulation of particles the process
    is known as *varnishing*. Finally, the progressive weathering of the engraving’s
    traces can also be measured. By studying the pace of these natural processes,
    scientists can propose dates for the engravings. However, as with carbon-14, these
    methods have several problems that affect their suitability: the study of these
    natural processes is slow and costly, and the results can only be applied to small,
    concrete areas. There are also problems with the accuracy of the measurements,

    __Stylistic dating__

    The importance of dating has been at the forefront of much research in North African rock art, yet there is no consensus of opinion about the precise dating of the phases of rock art in this region. The construction of rock art sequences has been predicated on stylistic analysis, on which most scholars agree in principle, and broadly conforms to the following:


    - *Early Hunter*, *Wild Fauna* Period or *Bubalus* Period: 12,000 – 8,000 years ago
    - *Round Head* Period: 10,000 – 8,000 years ago
    - *Pastoral* Period: 7,500 – 4,000 years ago
    - *Horse* Period: 3,000 – 2,000 years ago
    - *Camel* Period: 2,000 years ago – present

    For the most part, there is general agreement on the dating of the Horse and Camel period, but the earliest phases of rock art - the *Bubalus*/*Round Head*/*Pastoral* periods, are much more contentious. Researchers Henri Lhote and Alfredo Muzzolini have argued that the *Pastoral* period begins around 6,000 years ago, while others, such as Fabrizio Mori, propose an earlier date of 8,000 years ago. Domestic stock is thought to have existed in the Sahara from around 7,500 years ago, making a date of 8,000 years old for paintings of cattle (which may have been wild) feasible. Dating the end of this period is just as problematic, with Lhote and Mori placing it between 3,000-4,000 years ago and Muzzolini about 1,000 years later. However, the largest discrepancy relates to the *Bubalus* and *Round Head* periods, where significantly disparate chronologies have been proposed by Lhote, Mori and Muzzolini. The most extreme of these is the *Bubalus* period, where Mori advocates an Early/Long chronology proposing that the earliest images date back 12,000 years, while Muzzolini suggests a Recent/Short chronology proposing a much later emergence of art in the region at 6,000 years ago.

    The application of direct dating will be central in resolving these substantial differences and has yielded some fruitful results on archaeological sites in making meaningful correlations. However, for the time being, the chronologies of Saharan rock art remain ambiguous and contested.

    __Relative dating__

    Based on observations in the field, relative sequences were proposed by Patricia Vinnicombe (1976) for the southern region of the Drakensberg and by Revell Mason (1933) and Harald Pager (1971) for the northern region. Subsequently, several sites in South Africa have been analysed using a method termed the Harris Matrix. In its original context the Harris Matrix was a diagrammatic tool used in archaeological fieldwork to determine the temporal succession of deposits and stratigraphic relationships. Its use in South African rock art has been limited and often on isolated sites, and one of the drawbacks in this methodology is the lack of information on time lapses between successive images. While a few radiocarbon and Accelerator Mass Spectometry (AMS) dates have been secured for some sites, the absolute dates need to be matched with relative chronologies, which to date are still not firmly established.

    __Stylistic dating__

    Much rock art research has focused on the San rock paintings found in southern Africa (Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe). The subject matter of San rock art is extremely varied but regional characteristics can be seen; for example, depictions of eland dominate much of the rock art in South Africa, while kudu and elephants prevail in Zimbabwe. The earliest San art is thought to be up to 10,000 years old and continues possibly well into the twentieth century in the Drakensberg mountains.

    The spread of farming to South Africa by Bantu-language speakers around 3,500 years ago brought another style of rock art, until it ceased around the mid-1900s. The art is predominantly in white, and applied using fingers, which gives it a rough appearance. Subject matter is varied but dominated by humans and animals. Later rock art reflected contact with European settlers/colonisers, attested to by the numerous depictions of steam trains, soldiers, settlers and guns.

  title: Chronologies in central and eastern Africa
  title_internal: 'General: chronologies, chapter 10'
  body: |-
    __Absolute/Relative dating__

    Little research has been conducted, either on absolute or relative rock art chronologies in central Africa, and is therefore still poorly understood by comparison with northern and southern Africa. Promising recent radiocarbon dates have been reported from paintings in Angola, but the absence of contextual information with these dates renders them unproductive. Dating rock art by association with archaeological deposits has not proved entirely successful either. Relative chronologies have been suggested, and while there are regional variations, in general two styles of rock art have been identified and associated with a relative chronology: Twa and Sandawe.

    __Stylistic dating__

    Twa-style art dates to around 3,000 to 1,000 years ago and was made by hunter-gatherer groups in eastern and central Africa. Depictions of animals are rare in Twa art and usually consist of geometric designs, often concentric circles. Ancestral Sandawe art, found mainly in central Tanzania, is thought to date from around 9,000 years ago to the recent past, and includes fairly large naturalistic images of animals in both hunting and domestic scenes. Figures are frequently holding bows and arrows, and are often depicted with elaborate hairstyles and/or headdresses.

  title: Art and our modern mind
  title_internal: 'General: origins, chapter 3'
  body: |-
    While the Apollo 11 plaques may be the oldest discovered representational art in Africa, this is not the beginning of the story of art. It is now well-established, through genetic and fossil evidence, that anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) developed in Africa more than 100,000 years ago; of these, a small group left the Continent around 60,000-80,000 years ago and spread throughout the rest of the world. Recently discovered examples of patterned stone, ochre and ostrich eggshell, as well as evidence of personal ornamentation emerging from Middle Stone Age Africa (100,000–60,000 years ago), have demonstrated that ‘art’ is not only a much older phenomenon than previously thought, but that it has its roots in the African continent. Africa is where we share a common humanity.

    The first examples of what we might term ‘art’ in Africa, dating from between 100,000–60,000 years ago, emerge in two very distinct forms: personal adornment in the form of perforated seashells suspended on twine, and incised and engraved stone, ochre and ostrich eggshell. Despite some sites being 8,000km and 40,000 years apart, an intriguing feature of the earliest art is that these first forays appear remarkably similar. It is worth noting here that the term ‘art’ in this context is highly problematic, in that we cannot assume that humans living 100,000 years ago, or even 10,000 years ago, had a concept of art in the same way that we do, particularly in the modern Western sense. However, it remains a useful umbrella term for our purposes here.

  title: Pattern and design
  title_internal: 'General: origins, chapter 4'
  body: |-
    The practice of engraving or incising, which emerges around 12,000 years ago in Saharan rock art, has its antecedents much earlier, up to 100,000 years ago. Incised and engraved stone, bone, ochre and ostrich eggshell have been found at sites in southern Africa. These marked objects share features in the expression of design, exhibiting patterns that have been classified as cross-hatching.

    One of the most iconic and well-publicised sites that have yielded cross-hatch incised patterning on ochre is Blombos Cave, on the southern Cape shore of South Africa. Of the more than 8,500 fragments of ochre deriving from the MSA levels, 15 fragments show evidence of engraving. Two of these, dated to 77,000 years ago, have received the most attention for the design of cross-hatch pattern.

    For many archaeologists, the incised pieces of ochre at Blombos are the most complex and best-formed evidence for early abstract representations, and are unequivocal evidence for symbolic thought and language. The debate about when we became a symbolic species and acquired fully syntactical language – what archaeologists term ‘modern human behaviour’ – is both complex and contested. It has been proposed that these cross-hatch patterns are clear evidence of thinking symbolically, because the motifs are not representational and as such are culturally constructed and arbitrary. Moreover, in order for the meaning of this motif to be conveyed to others, language is a prerequisite.

    The Blombos engravings are not isolated occurrences, since the presence of such designs occur at more than half a dozen other sites in South Africa, suggesting that this pattern is indeed important in some way, and not the result of idiosyncratic behaviour. It is worth noting, however, that for some scholars, the premise that the pattern is symbolic is not so certain. The patterns may indeed have a meaning, but it is how that meaning is associated, either by resemblance (iconic) or correlation (indexical), that is important for our understanding of human cognition.

    The presence of rock art in Egypt has been noticed by European scholars since the early 19th century. Geographically isolated from the bulk of rock art in the country, the paintings and engravings of Gilf Kebir and Jebel Uweinat were first catalogued in the 1920s by the Egyptian explorers and public figures Hassanein Bey and Prince Kemal el Dine, and thereafter by renowned early twentieth century explorers and ethnographers such as László Almásy, Leo Frobenius, Ralph Bagnold and Abbé Breuil, whose expeditions helped bring Saharan rock art into wider public consciousness.

    Hans Winkler’s seminal *Rock Drawings of Southern Upper Egypt* (1938-9) was one of the first regional catalogues and remains a pre-eminent review of finds. Further cataloguing of rock art images and sites in the southern Nile valley took place at the time of the construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s. Where rock art historically was part of larger archaeological research in the area, in recent years it has been subject to more direct and rigorous study which will contribute to a better understanding of chronologies and relationships.

    from between 3,100 and 30 BC can be found on rock faces, particularly at oases
    and quarry sites such as Kharga Oasis and Wadi Hammamat in the Western and Eastern
    deserts. There is also rock art from later periods like that at Matna el-Barqa
    in the Western Desert hinterland, where both Pharaonic and later Coptic inscriptions
    mix with images of gods and horsemen. Earlier examples of engraved rock art may
    be found in the Nile valley, in what is now southern Egypt and northern Sudan,
    linked to progenitors of ancient Egyptian cultures, most particularly the people
    of the Naqada Periods (4,000-3,100 BC). This art is characterised by frequent
    depictions on pottery of river boats, which occur in much of the rock art near
    the Nile, and include, pecked on a boulder at Nag el-Hamdulab near Aswan, what
    is considered the first known depiction of a Pharaoh, on just such a boat. Also
    prevalent in these areas are numerous engravings of animals and human figures.

    Palaeolithic Period, between 16,000 and 15,000 years ago, making them the oldest
    known rock art in northern Africa. Between the eighth and fourth millennia BC,
    Egypt’s climate was generally temperate, interrupted only briefly by dry spells,

  body: Some of Egypt’s most striking and famous rock art is found far from the Nile
    at Gilf Kebir, a vast sandstone plateau in the desert near the Libyan border.
    As elsewhere in the Sahara, there are frequent depictions of domestic cattle,
    people and wild animals. Like most rock art, the paintings and engravings here
    are hard to date accurately but may refer to the ‘Bovidian Period’ (Pastoral Period)
    rock art of the wider Sahara, typified by paintings and engravings of cattle and
    people (Huyge, 2009). However, the scholarly community recognises the inherent
    difficulty of formulating conclusions of direct links with wider rock art practices.
    Some evidence of pastoralists in the area means that this rock art could have
    been made as early as the fifth millennium BC and are thus possibly contemporaneous
    with Predynastic Egyptian cultures, but not necessarily connected (Riemer, 2013).

    cosmology is better known, it can be speculated, such as the Nile boat paintings
    have been suggested to evoke funerary beliefs and practices. If nothing else,
    the cattle paintings of Gilf Kebir demonstrate the importance of cattle in the
    pastoralist culture that produced them. Despite still being relatively little
    known, the ‘mystique’ behind rock art has cultivated popular curiosity, in particular
    in Gilf Kebir’s famous ‘Cave of Swimmers’. This is a shallow rock shelter featuring
    many painted human figures in strange contortions, as if swimming – images which
    have captured the popular imagination, with their glimpse of life in Egypt millennia
    before the Pharaohs and their hints at a watery Sahara.

    weapons and horses. Approximately 1,000 engravings of warriors have been recorded

    has been proposed that there are two main stages of this Libyan Warrior rock art.
    The oldest is linked to a pastoral economy based on cattle-rearing, when metal
    had been introduced to the region and the use of the spear took over from the
    traditional bow. This region also hosts images of wild animals such as Barbary

    images of wild animals such as elephants, rhinoceros, giraffe and other game,
    and dated to the Early Hunter or Bubalus Period; human figures are very rare.
    Tazina-style engravings – similar to those found in south-eastern Morocco – also
    occur, as well as polychrome fine-line and finger paintings that are unique to
    this area.

  body: The number of cattle depictions is small, but particular images of calves
    attached to a lead can be compared stylistically with images of cattle in Tassili
    n’Ajjer, Algeria. Moreover, Henri Lhote noted the resemblance between these rock
    art depictions and the husbandry practices of the present day Wodaabe people of
    Niger, who use a similar calf rope. The calf rope (a long rope comprising loops
    within which the heads of the calves are secured) is both practical and symbolic,
    ensuring the cows always return to their home camp, while also physically dividing
    the camp into male and female halves. It is interesting to note the close relationship
    between the rock art of regions that today are politically discrete.

  title: History of rock art discovery in Niger
  title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 7'
  body: Until relatively recently rock art research has been sporadic in Niger. In
    the 1920s Major Gen. Francis Rodd, a British explorer and army officer, made two
    great expeditions into the Sahara. He was the first person to make a serious study
    of the Tuareg and documented some of the rock art in the Aïr Mountains. Subsequently,
    French colonial officers noted some sites around 1960. However, it was French
    archaeologist Henri Lhote who undertook major recording programmes throughout
    the 1960s and 1970s to document, trace and publish several thousand engravings.
    Very little information is known relating the rock art to known cultural groups,
    either past or present. Most of the sites were not habitation sites, and were
    probably only occasionally visited by nomadic societies in the past, so very little
    (if any) archaeological evidence remains. Most of the art predates the residence
    of the Tuareg, who now inhabit this area and who appear to have no direct connections
    with the art. The Tuareg recognise old script which sometimes accompanies images
    as it closely resembles their own writing, *Tifinagh*; however, it is incomprehensible
    to them if it is more than 100 years old.

    the Horse Period and Libyan Warrior Period date from around 3,000–1,500 years
    ago. Depictions are of horses with so-called Libyan Warriors, with metal weapons
    or with chariots and charioteers. Human figures, which often appear with horses,
    were sometimes depicted with elaborate apparel; others were drawn with stylized
    bodies consisting of two triangles joined at the apex. Wild animals such as Barbary
    sheep and ostrich, as well as cattle, appear in this art. Art of the Horse Period
    is not widely represented in the Djado Plateau, suggesting that Berber groups
    did not reach the region in any great numbers – but it has been proposed that
    certain peculiarities of style may suggest an influence from Aïr.

    for its rich concentrations of rock art, particularly in the Tassili n’Ajjer,
    inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. More than 15,000 paintings
    and engravings, some of which date back up to 12,000 years, provide unique insights
    into the environmental, social, cultural and economic changes in the country across
    a period of 10,000 or more years. The area is particularly famous for its Round
    Head paintings, first described and published in the 1930s by French archaeologist
    Henry Lhote.

  title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 2'
  body: Algeria is situated in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered on the
    west by Morocco and on the east by Tunisia and Libya, with a long Mediterranean
    coastline to the north. The Atlas Mountains cross Algeria east to west along the
    Mediterranean coast. The northern portion of the country is an area of mountains,
    valleys, and plateaus, but more than 80% of the country falls within the Sahara
    Desert. Rock art is located in the Algerian Maghreb and the Hoggar Mountains but
    the richest zone of rock art is located in the mountain range of Tassili n'Ajjer,
    a vast plateau in the south-east of the country. Water and sand erosion have carved
    out a landscape of thin passageways, large arches, and high-pillared rocks, described
    by Lhote as 'forests of stone'.

  body: |-
    Rock art in Algeria, notably the engravings in South Oran, has been the subject of European study since 1863. Notable surveys were made by A. Pomel (1893-1898), Stéphane Gsell (1901-1927), G. B. M. Flamand (1892-1921), Leo Frobenius and Hugo Obermaier (1925), Henri Breuil (1931-1957), L. Joleaud (1918-1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (1935-1955). Henri Lhote visited the area in 1955 and 1964, completing previous research and adding new descriptions included in a major publication on the area in 1970.

    The rock art of the Tassili region was introduced to Western eyes as a result of visits and sketches made by French legionnaires, in particular a Lt. Brenans during the 1930s. On several of his expeditions, Lt. Brenans took French archaeologist Henri Lhote who went on to revisit sites in Algeria between 1956-1970 documenting and recording the images he found. Regrettably, some previous methods of recording and/or documenting have caused damage to the vibrancy and integrity of the images.

    fertile environment teeming with life and includes elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus
    and fish as well as numerous predators, giraffe, and plains animals such as antelope
    and gazelle. When human figures are depicted in this period they are very small
    in stature and hold throwing sticks or axes. More than simply hunting scenes,
    they are likely to reflect people’s own place within their environment and their
    relationship with it.

    up to 9,000 years old, some of these paintings are the largest found on the African
    continent, measuring up to 13 feet in height. The Round Head period comprises
    depictions of figures with round, featureless heads and formless bodies, often
    appearing to be ‘floating’. Some features or characteristics of Round Head paintings
    found on the Tassili plateau are unique to the area, and the depiction of certain
    motifs may have held special significance locally, making particular sites where
    they occur the locus of rites, ritual or ceremonial activity. The majority of
    animal depictions are mouflon (wild mountain sheep) and antelope, but they are
    represented only in static positions and not as part of a hunting scene.

    Depictions now include domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, goats and dogs;
    scenes portray herders, men hunting with bows, and representations of camp life
    with women and children – in essence, scenes that reference more settled communities.

    Desertification across the Sahara required new methods of traversing and utilising the landscape; depictions of horses (often with riders) and of chariots indicate this change. Horse-drawn chariots are often depicted at a ‘flying’ gallop and are likely to have been used for hunting rather than warfare.

    Libyan-Berber script, used by ancestral Berber peoples, started to appear in association with images. However, the meaning of this juxtaposition of text and image remains an enigma, as it is indecipherable to modern day Tuareg.

    Nubian Nile valley, the result of archaeological salvage projects, aimed at documenting
    and conserving archaeological sites and artefacts in advance of engineered flooding
    events, such as the construction of the Aswan High dam in the 1960s and the Merowe
    dam in the early 2000s. This has resulted in significant rock art and rock gong
    discoveries, such as that noted near the Second Cataract (Žába, 1967) and more
    recently around the Fourth. Rock art remains vulnerable to damming initiatives
    – that at Sabu is currently under threat by the Kajbar Dam proposal at the Third
    Cataract. There is great scope for further research.

    The rock art of Sudan is varied across both time periods and geographical regions. Numerous pecked depictions of domestic cattle can be found in the Red Sea Hills (Pluskota, 2006) as well as depictions of both domestic and wild animals closer to the River Nile, such as those found at Jebel Gorgod in a mountainous area near Sesebi (Schiff Giorgini, 1972). Engravings, like those around the Second, Third, and Fourth Cataracts (areas of rocky rapids) are varied in subject matter and in date, ranging from Neolithic engravings of wild and domestic fauna to those with Medieval Christian imagery, for example around the Dal Cataract (Mills, 1965). These are mixed with others from about 4,000 BC onwards which may be contemporary with the Predynastic cultures and Pharaonic periods of ancient Egypt and in northern Sudan, Nubian Kerma culture (known to the ancient Egyptians as the Kingdom of Kush). These include depictions of Nile river boats and later hieroglyphic inscriptions.

    The peripatetic nature of these traceable signatures highlights the need to look beyond modern boundaries when considering ancient rock art traditions of Africa. For millennia prior to the creation of the current Egypt/Sudan border, the highway of the river allowed movement between Egypt and Nubia, the people of the region leaving their marks on a narrow area of fertile land that fostered riverine animals like crocodiles, which are occasionally depicted in the rock engravings. From the 4th millennium BC, following several temperate millennia, savannah animals like giraffe lost their habitat in the increasingly arid environments to east and west, but remain reflected in the rock engravings of what is now desert.

    The range in styles and dates for Sudanese rock art emphasises its nature, not as a particular artistic style, but as personal and cultural manipulations of a specific medium. A number of stone percussive instruments known as rock gongs, which produce a sonorous tone when struck and are often apparently associated with cattle engravings, have stimulated discussion about the uses of rock art sites as multisensory ritual venues.

  title: Chronology
  title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 5'
  body: The understanding of much of Sudanese prehistory as it relates to rock art
    remains subject to debate. Some of the best-preserved and most varied rock art
    of Sudan’s desert regions is situated only metres from the Egyptian border in
    the far north-west corner of the country, in a valley of Jebel Uweinat – the enormous
    sandstone and granite outcrop which serves as a boundary between Egypt, Sudan
    and Libya. Numerous paintings and engravings are found here, including images
    of wild animals, such as giraffe and antelope, humans, dogs and many cattle. Some
    of these paintings have been compared with other styles of rock art in the wider
    Sahara, including the later Pastoral Period (Muzzolini, 1995). Others have proposed
    that a different set of paintings in these sites may be older, with a stylistic
    link (although fragile) with the Round Head Period (Van Noten,1978). However,
    the scholarly community recognises the inherent difficulty of formulating conclusions
    of direct links with wider rock art practices. In areas around the Nile, where
    there are similar animal engravings, rock art is also from a wide range of time
    periods.

  body: 'Ascribing dates to rock art like that at Jebel Uweinat is also uncertain
    and is more difficult than dating images such as the depictions of Nile river
    boats or later Christian cross engravings like those found near the Third Cataract,
    where similar motifs are replicated on contemporary pottery and corroborated elsewhere
    in the archaeological record. Occasionally rock art may be found in a dateable
    stratigraphic context- a giraffe engraving at Gala Abu Ahmed in Wadi Howar, an
    ancient Nile tributary, was recently dated to before 1,200-1,300 BC in this way
    (Jesse, 2005). In general, other clues are necessary, for example known domestication
    dates: wild animal images are often superseded with depictions of animals like
    horses and camels. These were only widely known in northeast Africa from the second
    and first millennia BC respectively and are therefore unlikely to be older. However,
    this is not an exact science: examination of the superimpositions and levels of
    patination on some Nile valley cattle engravings show that they were made over
    thousands of years up to the not too distant past. Faced with such challenges,
    classifying rock art by design style, while problematic, can prove useful in envisioning

    of mammals from the Wild Fauna Period (Early Hunter Period) and could be up to
    12,000 years old. Thousands of paintings dating from up to 8,000-9,000 years ago
    show a diversity of imagery and include scenes of hunting, pastoralism, daily
    life, dancing and a variety of wild and domesticated animals. The Messak Plateau
    is home to tens of thousands of engravings, and only a few paintings have been
    located in this region to date. The area is best known for larger-than-life-size
    engravings of animals such as elephants, rhino and bubalus (a now extinct buffalo),
    and some of the most iconic depictions in Saharan rock art, such as the ‘Fighting

  body: The fourth largest country in Africa, Libya is located in the Maghreb region
    of North Africa, bordered on the west by Tunisia and Algeria, Egypt to the east,
    and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. Except for the narrow strip along the
    coast, where 80% of the population resides, Libya lies entirely within the Sahara
    Desert. The main areas of rock art lie in the south-western corner of the country,
    with the Tadrart Acacus continuing into south-eastern Algeria, where they are
    simply known as the Tadrart. The Acacus in Libya and the Tadrart in Algeria are
    now listed and combined as a trans-frontier World Heritage Site by UNESCO, linking
    these two geographically divided sites into a cultural whole.

    in 1850, although it was not until 1932 that the engravings were methodically
    studied by Leo Frobenius. Some initial interpretative hypotheses about the rock
    art in the Acacus were formulated in the late 1930s by Italian archaeologist Paolo
    Graziosi. Subsequently, the region became the subject of systematic investigation
    by Fabrizio Mori, another Italian archaeologist, who also published the first
    scientific papers on Libyan rock art in the 1960s. Since then, consistent surveying
    has continued in this region and stratigraphic excavations of archaeological deposits
    have established a cultural sequence dating back to the Holocene Period.

  title: Chronology and early rock art
  title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 4'
  body: |-
    Rock art chronology in North Africa is based largely on the combination of stylistic features, superimposition, subject matter and the degree of weathering or patina. While not an exact science, chronological periods are recognisable in the depictions, which generally correspond to climatic and environmental phases. Some of the oldest images are found on the Messak plateau and represent a Sahara that was significantly wetter and more fertile than today, exemplified by representations of large mammals – some of which are aquatic species – incised into the rock faces.

    The chronology of the Tadrart Acacus during the Holocene has been established more firmly through the excavation and dating of archaeological sites. Based on this evidence, these earliest images may coincide with the first Holocene occupation of the area by specialised hunter-gatherers – known as the 'Early Acacus' Period – which some researchers date to around 11,000 years ago.

  title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 5'
  body: From around 9,000 years ago, the archaeological record in the Acacus changes;
    sites are larger, featuring more formalised stone structures with heavy grinding
    equipment and large pots. Subsistence strategies based on hunting and gathering
    remain, but archaeological evidence suggests the presence of corralling Barbary
    sheep and the storage of wild cereals. Fragments of grinding stones with traces
    of colour from the Takarkori rock shelter, dating from between 6,800–5,400 BC,
    may have been used as palettes for rock or body painting, and have been connected
    chronologically to the Round Head Period. A large proportion of paintings in this
    period portray very large figures with round, featureless heads and can often
    be depicted in ‘floating’ positions; women often have their hands raised, interpreted
    as postures of supplication.

  title: Horse and Camel Periods
  title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 7'
  body: |-
    Historical records have tended to date the introduction of both the horse and the camel in northern Africa rather than the archaeological record. Yet, in terms of rock art research in this region, less attention has been given to these styles; the reason for this may be that the earliest rock art attracted more scholarly consideration than the later depictions. However, their representation certainly demonstrates the changing natural and cultural environment and associated human responses and adaptations.

    The rock art of Libya is a visual testament to the changing fortunes of this part of the Sahara and the cultural groups who have occupied and navigated the area over thousands of years. The engravings and paintings act as a legacy, tracing the environmental effects of climate change, how people have adapted to that change and the cultural worlds they have created.

    The first area groups more than seven thousand engravings around the Oukaïmeden
    valley, the Yagour plateau and the Jebel Rat site. They are at high altitude (more
    than 2000 metres above sea level), and mainly represent weapons, cattle and anthropomorphic
    figures, along with numerous geometric symbols.

    BC, Libyan-Berber hunting and battle scenes start to appear in southern Morocco;
    riders, infantrymen and animals depicted in a very schematic style. The last period

  title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 2'
  body: |-
    In total Mauritania covers about 1,030,700 km², most of which forms part of the western portion of the Sahara desert. The southern part of Mauritania incorporates some of the more temperate Sahelian zone, forming part of the geographical and cultural border between Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa. The landscape of the country is generally characterised by its flatness, but the two major neighbouring plateaux in the East-Centre of the country – the Tagant in the South and the Adrar further North – are furnished with rock shelters, boulders and other surfaces upon which can be found abundant rock art, more often engraved than painted.

    The principal concentrations of rock art in Mauritania are located in these two areas, as well as in the North around Bir Moghreïn (in the Mauritanian extension of the Zemmur mountains), the Hank ridge near the borders of Algeria and Mali and the Tichitt-Walata area to the east of the Tagant plateau.

    __Adrar__

    There are about thirty known rock art sites in the Adrar region, although, as with most Mauritanian rock art, study has not been comprehensive and there may be many more as yet undocumented. Engraved rock art sites dominate along the northern edge of the massif, with some of the most significant to be found at the sites of El Beyyed and El Ghallaouiya. Rarer paintings of cattle are also to be found at El Ghallaouiya, as well as at the site of Amogjar.

    __Tagant__

    Less well studied than Adrar, the Tagant plateau contains several painting sites showing horses and riders such as those at the sites of Agneitir Dalma and Tinchmart. The archaeologically significant area of the Tichitt-Walata ridge, a chain of escarpments known for its Neolithic settlements, is largely located within the wider Tagant region to the east of the plateau, and also features many engravings and some paintings.

  body: |-
    Recording and research on Mauritanian rock art has been limited in comparison with other Saharan rock art traditions, and has mainly been undertaken by French scholars, as Mauritania was formerly part of French West Africa. The first major publications cataloguing rock art sites in the country were those of Théodore Monod (1937-8), based on recordings collected on expeditions made between 1934 and 1936 and covering the entire western Saharan region. Following this, the explorers Marion Senones and Odette du Puigaudeau published some paintings of the Tagant region in1939. A more comprehensive study of the paintings, engravings and inscriptions of West and North West Africa was made by Raymond Mauny (1954), and emphasised the importance of systematically recording and studying the images in their contexts. More recently (1993), Robert Vernet produced a synthesis of known Mauritanian rock art in his *Préhistoire de la Mauritanie*.

    Many individual Mauritanian rock art sites have also been recorded and published over the decades since the 1940s, particularly in the context of associated archaeological sites, such as those at Tegdaoust and in the Tichitt-Walata region.

    The range of subject matter in the rock art of Mauritania is similar to that of other Saharan countries, consisting primarily of images of domestic cattle, along with those of horses both mounted and unmounted, human figures and weaponry, wild fauna, hunting scenes, camels and Libyco-Berber/Tifinagh and Arabic script. Images of goats and sheep are extremely rare.

    Some general geographic tendencies in style and type can be made out, for example, deeply cut and polished naturalistic engravings of large wild animals are concentrated in the North of the country. There is an apparent North-South divide in engraving style, with images becoming more schematic further south. Rarer painting sites are clustered in certain areas such as north of Bir Moghreïn in the far north, and certain Adrar sites, with horse and rider paintings most common in the Tagant and Tichitt-Walata regions.

    Mauritanian rock art consists most commonly of similar-looking scenes of cattle, hunting tableaux, or camel depictions, but there are some exceptions of interest, for example: the monumental bull engraving from Akhrejit in the Dhar Tichitt, which is nearly 5 metres long; the unusually naturalistic paintings of cattle at Amogjar and Tenses in the Adrar; and the curiously shaped painted horses at Guilemsi in the Tagant-Titchitt region.

    In addition, although images of chariots apparently drawn by oxen are known elsewhere in the Sahara, chariots in Saharan rock art are normally associated with horses. In Mauritania, however, there are several images of ox chariots or carts – both painted and engraved – as well as depictions of cattle apparently bearing burdens/saddles, or mounted. Moreover, Mauritania has no known depictions of chariots where the draught animal is identifiably a horse, although there are many images of horses and riders. Sometimes chariots are depicted independent of any animals drawing them, and in all there are over 200 known images of chariots in the country.

    and the arrival of Libyan (Berber) horsemen’ (Monod, 1938, p.128). Relative chronologies
    of rock art styles are easier to identify than specific dates, as they may be
    based on visible elements such as superimpositions in paintings, and the darkness
    level of accrued patina in engravings. In Mauritania, researchers have generally
    paid particular attention to patina as well as themes and styles in order to try
    and place a timeframe on different rock art traditions. Even this is an inexact
    science – however, Monod did propose a three-phase chronology, with 1) ‘Ancient’
    prehistoric rock art showing large wild fauna and cattle, 2) ‘Middle’ pre-Islamic
    art showing horses, camels, riders, arms and armour, hunting scenes and Libyco-Berber

    period from 5,000–2,000 BC, a cattle pastoralist phase from 2,500–1,000 BC, a
    horse period from 1,200 BC onwards, a ‘Libyco-Berber’ group from 200 BC–700 AD
    and a final ‘Arabo-Berber’ phase from 700 AD onwards (Mauny, 1954). While the
    oldest rock art, such as the paintings at Amogjar, could be more than 5,000 years
    old, it appears that most Mauritanian rock art probably post-dates 2,000 BC, with
    some, particularly that involving camels, made within the last 2,000 years.

  title: Interpretation
  title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 10'
  body: 'Generally, the study of Mauritanian rock art traditions has focused more
    on cataloguing the images and categorising them by style, technique and perceived
    age than investigating their potential cultural significance. The limitations
    in the ability to scientifically date these images, and the fact that they are
    not usually associated with other archaeological materials, hinders effective
    attempts at interpretation or ascribing authorship, beyond basic ‘Neolithic’ ‘pastoralist’,
    or ‘early Berber’. Even this may not be clear-cut or mutually exclusive: for example,
    incoming Berber peoples in the Adrar Plateau after 2,000 BC are thought to have
    been cattle pastoralists, as their non-Berber predecessors probably were. In addition,
    while the desertification process was definitive from this time on, fluctuations
    and regional microclimates made pastoralism viable relatively recently in some
    areas – in the Adrar there is still evidence of cattle rearing as late as 1,000
    BC or after, and some areas of the Tagant region may have been able to support
    cattle as late as the 18th century. Thus subject matter alone is not necessarily
    indicative of date or authorship: depictions of cattle may be Berber or non-Berber,
    as old as the 4th millennium BC or as recent as the 1st, if not later.'

  body: It is possible to make some more specific inferences based on style. Some
    of the more naturalistic cattle paintings from the Adrar have been compared in
    style to the Bovidian style paintings of the Tassili n’Ajjer in Libya, and some
    of the more geometric designs to others in Senegal and Mali. Links have also been
    suggested between some cattle and symbolic images and modern Fulani and Tuareg
    traditions and iconography. In terms of significance, changes to rock art style
    over time, from naturalistic to schematic, have been remarked upon as perhaps
    somehow reflecting environmental changes from savannah to steppe and desert. It
    has also been debated whether some of the geometric symbols and images of riders
    on horseback were the result of conflict, perhaps made by the victims of Berber
    invasions as catharsis or to ward off evil.

  title_internal: 'Chad: country, chapter 2'
  body: 'The north-south orientation of Chad''s elongated shape means it is divided
    into several different climatic zones: the northern part belongs to the Sahara
    Desert, while the central area is included in the Sahel border (the semi-arid
    region south of the Sahara). The southern third of the country is characterized
    by a more fertile savannah. The Ennedi Plateau and Tibesti mountains contain thousands
    of pieces of rock art, including some of the most famous examples in the Sahara.
    The Ennedi Plateau is located at the north-eastern corner of Chad, on the southern
    edge of the Sahara Desert. It is a sandstone massif carved by erosion in a series
    of superimposed terraces, alternating plains and ragged cliffs crossed by wadis
    (seasonal rivers). Unlike other areas in the Sahara with rock art engravings or
    paintings, the Ennedi Plateau receives rain regularly – if sparsely – during the
    summer, making it a more benign environment for human life than other areas with
    significant rock art to the north, such as the Messak plateau or the Tassili Mountains
    in Libya and Algeria.'

  body: |-
    Different areas of Chad have been subject to varying trajectories of research. In the Tibesti Mountains, rock art was known to Europeans as early as 1869, although it was between the 1910s and 1930s that the first studies started to be carried out, by François D’Alverny. However, the main boost in research came in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to the work of Paul Huard. Over the last 50 years, researchers have found thousands of depictions throughout the region, most of them engravings, although paintings are also well represented.

    In the case of the Ennedi Plateau, its isolated position far from the main trade routes made its rock art unknown outside the area until the 1930s. During this decade, Burthe d’Annelet brought attention to the art, and De Saint-Floris published the first paper on the subject. The main effort to document this rock art came in 1956-1957, when Gerard Bailloud recorded more than 500 sites in only a sixth of the plateau's entire area.

  title_internal: 'Chad: country, chapter 5'
  body: As in the rest of the Sahara, the main themes in Chadian rock art are directly
    linked to the chronology. The oldest depictions are of wild animals, but most
    common are later scenes with cattle, huts and people. As in other areas of the
    Sahara, the most recent depictions correspond to battle scenes of riders on horses
    and camels. Along with these main subjects, both areas have examples of very detailed
    scenes of daily life and human activities, including people playing music, visiting
    the sick or dancing. The rock art of both the Ennedi Plateau and the Tibesti regions
    is characterized by the existence of a variety of local styles, such as the so-called
    ‘Flying Gallop style’, sometimes simultaneous, sometimes successive. This variability
    means an enormous richness of techniques, themes and artistic conventions, with
    some of the most original styles in Saharan rock art.

  title_internal: 'Chad: country, chapter 6'
  body: |-
    The oldest engravings in Chad are more recent than those to the north, having started to appear in the 5th to 4th millennia BC, and can be broadly divided into three main periods:

    The oldest is the so-called Archaic Period, characterized by wild animals in the Ennedi Plateau and Round Head-style figures in the Tibesti Mountains, similar to those found in the Central Sahara. The second phase is named the Bovine or Pastoral Period, when domestic cattle are the predominant animals, and a third, late period named the Dromedary or Camel Period. Unlike other areas in the Sahara, horse and camel depictions appear to be from roughly the same period (although horses were introduced to the Sahara first), so they are included in a generic Camel Period. The end of the rock art tradition in both areas is difficult to establish, but it seems to have lasted at least until the seventeenth century in the Ennedi Plateau, much longer than in other areas of the Sahara.

    Some of Kenya's various rock art traditions are attributed to or associated with
    the ancestors of modern regional cultural groups, and as such sites sometimes
    retain local religious importance. Both painted and engraved imagery tends towards
    the symbolic and geometric, with occasional depictions of schematic animals and

    which have not yet become known outside of their local communities, if they are

  body: 'Although researchers had been noting and investigating rock art in the neighbouring
    countries of Tanzania and Uganda from the early years of the 20th Century, the
    first published mention of Kenyan rock art appeared only in 1946, with Joy Adamson''s
    descriptions of engravings at Surima, in the northern Turkana region. It was in
    the 1960s that sustained academic attention began to be paid to other sites in
    the country. In 1961 Richard Wright published an account of a rock shelter (now
    known as Kiptogot Cave) with painted images of cattle on the slopes of Mount Elgon
    near Kitale. Wright suggested potential parallels in style with some Ethiopian
    pastoralist rock art. In 1968 Robert Soper was the first archaeologist to investigate
    the unique Namoratung’a burial sites to the east of Lake Turkana, with their engraved
    standing stones, the interpretation of which would be continued with the work
    of Mark Lynch and Lawrence Robbins in the 1970s. In the same decade significant
    painting sites at Lake Victoria, north of the lake near the Ugandan border, and
    in the far south were also reported on by James Chaplin, Osaga Odak and Richard
    Gramly. Research and discovery has continued and is likely that many rock art
    sites in Kenya remain to be documented. As recently as 2005, 21 previously unknown
    rock art sites in the Samburu area of central Kenya were recorded during dedicated
    survey work organised by the British Institute in East Africa.    '

  title: Themes
  title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 4'
  body: "Figurative imagery only features prominently in about 10% of the known rock
    art sites of Kenya.  That which exists tends to consist of very schematic images
    of cattle, wild animals and people. The majority of both painted and engraved
    rock art iconography throughout Kenya comprises symbols, with common patterns
    including circles, sometimes concentric or containing crosses, spirals, parallel
    or cross-hatched lines and curvilinear shapes.  Circular ground  depressions in
    the rock surface, known as cupules, are also a common variant of rock art in Kenya,
    along with rock gongs, which show evidence of the use of natural rock formations
    as percussive instruments.\n\nInterpretation, cultural attribution and proposed
    dates for these works vary widely across technique and area, although there are
    common themes.  It has been suggested that the schematic nature and similarities
    in the art may point to shared East African symbolic understandings common to
    different cultural groups, for example equating circular shapes (some of the most
    popular motifs in Eastern and Central African rock art in general) with chieftainship
    or the sun, or acting as navigation devices.\n\nGiven the variations in distance,
    age and nature of the sites, there is a danger of generalising, but there are
    factors which may contribute to more incisive interpretations of specific sites
    and symbols.  One set of interpretations for geometric shapes in Kenyan rock art
    points to the similarities of certain of these symbols to cattle brands used by
    Nilotic peoples throughout Kenya, including the Turkana, Samburu and Masai groups.
    \ Although the engravings at Namoratung'a are not thought to have been made by
    ancestral Turkana people, Lynch and Robbins noted the similarities of some of
    the symbols found there to contemporary local Turkana cattle brands.  These symbols
    are pecked on stones at graves containing mens’ remains and have been proposed
    to represent male lineages, as animal brands traditionally do in contemporary
    Nilotic ethnic groups. Further south, it is known that some more recent rock paintings
    representing brand and shield patterns were made by  Masai and Samburu men, in
    shelters used for meat-feasting—a  practice forbidden in their home compounds
    after their formal initiation as warriors—or as initiation sites. Actual representations
    of cattle are rare, with the vibrant paintings at Kakapel near the Ugandan border
    the most reknowned. Their creators are unknown although Masai and Samburu have
    been known to paint occasional schematic cattle in the past.    \n"

  title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 5'
  body: Not all of Kenya's rock art is associated with pastoralists. Much of the symbolic
    art, particularly to the south and west, is attributed to the ’Batwa’, ancestors
    of modern Batwa and related, traditionally hunter-gatherer cultural groups living
    around the Great Lakes Region of East and Central Africa.  Circular designs and
    “Sunburst” symbols are some of the most common motifs usually  associated with
    the Batwa rock art tradition; it has been proposed that they may have been associated  with
    fertility or rainmaking. Some rock art on Mfangano Island, in the Kenyan portion
    of Lake Victoria, has retained the latter association, having been used until
    the recent past by local Abasuba people for rainmaking purposes, despite their
    not having produced it originally. This re-use of symbolic sites in Kenya and
    the difficulty of dating further confuses the question of attribution for the
    art. The same rock art sites used by different cultural groups at different times
    and for different reasons. Such is the case at Kakapel for example, where it is
    posited that the earliest paintings may be hunter-gatherer in origin, with more
    recent cattle images added later, and Namoratung’a, with some engravings apparently
    hundreds of years old and others made within the last century.

  body: It is instructive to consider the use of rock art sites within their physical
    contexts as well as the rock art motifs themselves.  Locality and landscape are
    significant, for example at Namoratung’a, where the engraved basalt pillars at
    a related nearby site have been posited to be positioned according to astronomical
    calculations, based on an ancient Cushitic calendar.  There are various ways in
    which the creation and continued use of sites in Kenya may have been significantly
    interactive, such as in the ritual playing of rock gongs, or in the potential
    use of rows of cupules as gaming boards for forms of Mancala, a token game common
    through central and Southern Africa which was originally introduced to Kenya via
    Indian Ocean trade.  It is not known if cupules were actually created for this
    purpose—it has been suggested for example that  in some areas, cupules were formed
    for purely practical purposes, in the pulverising of food or materials for smelting
    activities. In Kenya, as elsewhere, what actually constitutes rock art is not
    always easy to identify.

  title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 7'
  body: "Rock art ascribed to Batwa peoples could be anywhere between 15,000-1,000
    years old, while pastoralist art is more recent.  Radiocarbon dating of rock art
    is difficult unless it is buried and associated with other uncontaminated organic
    remains and as such, scientifically dated rock art from Kenya is rare.  Radiocarbon
    dates from human remains in graves at Namoratung’a South date from the mid-1st
    Century BC to the mid-1st Millennium AD, but as dates like these are not directly
    relatable to the rock art, researchers have tended to concentrate on assigning
    chronologies based on varying levels of patination and style, without being able
    to ascribe more than estimated production dates.  \n\nThere are occasionally defining
    limits which aid in dating  specific sites, for example, cattle did not arrive
    in Eastern Africa until about 2,000 BC, so representations of cattle must postdate
    this.  In addition, in some cases, artworks known to have been associated with
    certain groups cannot have been produced prior to, or post, certain dates for
    political reasons. For example, Masai paintings at Lukenya Hill are known to have
    been painted prior to 1915, as Masai people were displaced from this area by European
    settlers after this date.  \n\nThe diversity of Kenyan rock art in motif, distribution
    and cultural context so far frustrates any attempts for a cohesive chronology,
    but the continuing local engagement with rock art sites in Kenya can potentially
    serve as a useful dating and interpretive resource for researchers alongside continuing
    archaeological research."

  title_internal: 'North Africa: regional, chapter 2'
  body: |+
    Although the styles and subjects of north African rock art vary, there are commonalities: images are most often figurative and frequently depict animals, both wild and domestic. There are also many images of human figures, sometimes with accessories such as recognisable weaponry or clothing. These may be painted or engraved, with frequent occurrences of both, at times in the same context. Engravings are generally more common, although this may simply be a preservation bias due to their greater durability.

    The physical context of rock art sites varies depending on geographical and topographical factors – for example, Moroccan rock engravings are often found on open rocky outcrops, while Tunisia’s Djebibina rock art sites have all been found in rock shelters. Rock art in the vast and harsh environments of the Sahara is often inaccessible and hard to find, and there is probably a great deal of rock art that is yet to be seen by archaeologists; what is known has mostly been documented within the last century.

    art that mirror those on dateable pottery. Authorship may be also guessed at through
    corroborating evidence: for example, due to knowledge of their chariot use, and
    the location of rock art depicting chariots in the central Sahara, it has been
    suggested that it was produced by – or at the same time as – the height of the
    Garamantes culture, a historical ethnic group who formed a local power around
    what is now southern Libya from 500 BC–700 AD. However, opportunities to anchor
    rock art imagery in this way to known ancient cultures are few and far between,
    and rock art is generally ascribed to anonymous hunter-gatherers, nomadic peoples,
    or pastoralists, with occasional imagery-based comparisons made with contemporary
    groups, such as the Fulani peoples.'

    Occasionally, association with writing in the form of, for example, Libyan-Berber or Arabic graffiti can give a known dating margin, but in general, lack of contemporary writing and written sources (Herodotus wrote about the Garamantes) leaves much open to conjecture.

    Other forms of (rare) circumstantial evidence, such as rock art covered by a dateable stratigraphic layer, and (more common) stylistic image-based dating have been used instead to form a chronology of Saharan rock art periods that is widely agreed upon, although dates are contested. The first stage, known as the Early Hunter, Wild Fauna or Bubalus Period, is posited at about 12,000–6,000 years ago, and is typified by naturalistic engravings of wild animals, in particular an extinct form of buffalo identifiable by its long horns.

    – at least when compared to other domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, horses
    and donkeys. Although the process is not yet fully known, camels were domesticated
    in the Arabian Peninsula around the third millennium BC, and spread from there
    to the Middle East, North Africa and Somalia from the 1st century AD onwards.
    The steps of this process from Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean have been documented
    through many different historical sources, from Roman texts to sculptures or coins,
    but it is especially relevant in Saharan rock art, where camels became so abundant
    that they have given their name to a whole period. The depictions of camels provide
    an incredible amount of information about the life, culture and economy of the
    Berber and other nomadic communities from the beginnings of the Christian era
    to the Muslim conquest in the late years of the 7th century.

    to avoid perspiration by manipulating their core temperature, enduring fluctuations
    of up to six degrees that could be fatal for other mammals. They rehydrate very
    quickly, and some of their physical features (nostrils, eyebrows) have adapted
    to increase water conservation and protect the animals from dust and sand. All
    these capacities make camels uniquely suited to hot climates: in temperatures
    of 30-40 °C, they can spend up to 15 days without water. In addition, they are
    large animals, able to carry loads of up to 300kg, over long journeys across harsh
    environments. The pads on their feet have evolved so as to prevent them from sinking
    into the sand. It is not surprising that dromedaries are considered the ‘ships

    where bone remains have been dated to the early 1st millennium BC. However, it
    took hundreds of years to move into the rest of North Africa due to the River
    Nile, which represented a major geographical and climatic barrier for these animals.
    The expansion began around the beginning of the Christian era, and probably took
    place both along the Mediterranean Sea and through the south of the Sahara. At
    this stage, it appears to have been very rapid, and during the following centuries
    camels became a key element in the North African societies. They were used mainly
    for riding, but also for transporting heavy goods and even for ploughing. Their
    milk, hair and meat were also used, improving the range of resources available
    to their herders. However, it seems that the large caravans that crossed the desert
    searching for gold, ivory or slaves came later, when the Muslim conquest of North
    Africa favoured the establishment of vast trade networks with the Sahel, the semi-arid
    region that lies south of the Sahara.

    That camels were used to transport goods is obvious, and depictions of long lines of animals are common, sometimes with saddles on which to place the packs and ropes to tie the animals together. However, if rock art depictions are some indication of camel use, it seems that until the Muslim conquest the main function of one-humped camels was as mounts, often linked to war. The Sahara desert contains dozens of astonishingly detailed images of warriors riding camels, armed with spears, long swords and shields, sometimes accompanied by infantry soldiers and horsemen. Although camels are not as good as horses for use as war mounts (they are too tall and make insecure platforms for shooting arrows), they were undoubtedly very useful in raids – the most common type of war activity in the desert – as well as being a symbol of prestige, wealth and authority among the desert warriors, much as they still are today.

    Moreover, the extraordinary detail of some of the rock art paintings has provided inestimable help in understanding how (and why) camels were ridden in the 1st millennium AD. Unlike horses, donkeys or mules, one-humped camels present a major problem for riders: where to put the saddle. Although it might be assumed that the saddle should be placed over the hump, they can, in fact, also be positioned behind or in front of the hump, depending on the activity. It seems that the first saddles were placed behind the hump, but that position was unsuitable for fighting, quite uncomfortable, and unstable. Subsequently, a new saddle was invented in North Arabia around the 5th century BC: a framework of wood that rested over the hump and provided a stable platform on which to ride and fight more effectively. The North Arabian saddle led to a revolution in the domestication of one-humped camels, allowed a faster expansion of the use of these animals, and it is probably still the most used type of saddle today.

    with the feet and legs, thus improving the ride. Moreover, the rider is seated
    in a lower position and thus needs shorter spears and swords that can be brandished
    more easily, making warriors more efficient. This new kind of saddle, which is
    still used throughout North Africa today, appears only in the western half of
    the Sahara and is well represented in the rock art of Algeria, Niger and Mauritania.

    skills. Concomitantly, marine shells were being collected to thread on to twine,

    We rarely consider the Sahara as the optimum environment for fishing. Seeing painted and engraved images of fish located in these waterless and unfavourable landscapes therefore seems at odds with our present-day knowledge of this vast desert. However, as we have noted before in these project pages (see introductions to Libya and Algeria), water-dependent animals such as crocodile and hippo have regularly been depicted in Saharan rock art, illustrating a once wetter and more fertile landscape. To date, the African rock art image project has catalogued representations of aquatic species in Libya, Algeria and Morocco, depicted with varying degrees of proficiency and ease of identification. This has been an insightful encounter, because it not only informs our thinking about the nature of the environment in the past and the way people were using their available resources, but also allows us to think about the cultural importance of water-based species.

    The rock art in these places is a glimpse into an aquatic past that is now supported by environmental evidence. In a recent collaborative project mapping ancient watercourses in the Sahara, it has been shown that during the Holocene (a period which started around 11,700 years ago), this now arid landscape was once covered by a dense interconnected river system, as well as large bodies of water known as ‘megalakes’. When these lakes overflowed, they linked catchment areas, resulting in a dense palaeoriver network that allowed water-dependent life (fish, molluscs and amphibians) to migrate and disperse across an extensive landscape. This interlinked waterway of the Sahara formed a single and vast biogeographic area. Perhaps not surprisingly, rock art sites appear to be clustered around inland deltas where resources would have been most plentiful.

    Across the Sahara, at least twenty-three species of fish have been identified in archaeological deposits from the Holocene, the most common being Tilapia, Catfish, African jewelfish, Silver fish and Nile perch. But can we go as far as to correlate the archaeological record with the rock art to species level?

    in rock art than other species of fish, possibly due to their physical characteristics.
    They possess an auxiliary breathing organ which allows them to inhabit extremely
    de-oxygenated water; in fact, when necessary they can obtain up to 50% of their
    total oxygen requirements from the air. In some cases they will leave the water
    and crawl on dry ground to escape drying pools. This capacity to live in very
    shallow waters and to occupy the liminal spaces between land and water has elevated
    them to more than a simple food source and given them a place of cultural significance
    in many African societies.

  body: In arid ecosystems, bodies of water are characterised by daily and seasonal
    fluctuations in water temperature, evaporation and other natural phenomena, and
    some fish species have adapted well to cope with these extreme changes in water
    chemistry. Catfish and Tilapia in particular are able to survive high salinity,
    which occurs through evaporation, while Redbelly Tilapia can also tolerate temperatures
    above 35° C. Both Sharptooth Catfish and Tilapia are floodplain dwellers and possess
    the ability to live and spawn in shallow waters, making them easily susceptible
    to predation. Catfish spines were also used to decorate Saharan pottery with dotted
    wavy-line patterns. These biological characteristics, which meant they could be
    easily hunted, may explain their frequent depiction in rock art. Perhaps their
    value was also reinforced by their being (possibly) the last fish species to survive
    once aridification had taken hold in the Sahara.

    dating to the Holocene. The vertical and wavy strands hanging down underneath
    could represent the pattern made in the sand by turtles when walking rather than
    being the tendrils of a jellyfish. Moreover, Fig 13 appears to resemble a snail
    and would be consistent with what we know about the Capsian culture who inhabited
    modern Tunisia and Algeria and parts of Libya during the early Holocene (10,000–6,000
    BC). Their distinguishing culinary feature was a fondness for escargots – edible

    has indicated that during the Holocene, Gobero was situated in an open savannah
    landscape of grasses and sedges, with fig trees and tamarisk, where permanent
    water and marshy habitats were present.

    Approximately 200 burials, ranging over a 5000-year period, were found on the edge of an ancient lake. Grave goods include bones or tusks from wild fauna, ceramics, lithic projectile points, and bone, ivory and shell ornaments. One adult male was buried in a recumbent pose seated on the carapace of a mud turtle. Microliths, bone harpoon points and hooks, and ceramics with dotted wavy-line and zigzag impressed motifs were found in the burial fill, in an associated midden area, and in nearby paleolake deposits. Nile perch (*Lates niloticus*), large catfish, and tilapia dominate the midden fauna, which also includes bones and teeth from hippos, several bovids, small carnivores, softshell turtles and crocodiles.

    The early Holocene occupants at Gobero (7700–6300 BC.) were largely sedentary hunter-fisher-gatherers with lakeside funerary sites. Across the ‘green’ Sahara, Catfish, Tilapia and turtles played important roles socially, economically and culturally. We can see this most explicitly in the burial within a turtle carapace in Gobero, but the representation of aquatic animals in rock art is a significant testament to their value.

    Desert, notably the Fezzan region, have included paintings of chariots in a variety
    of forms, dating to the Horse Period, from up to 3,000 years ago. This has stimulated
    some interesting questions about the use of chariots in what appears to be such
    a seemingly inappropriate environment for a wheeled vehicle, as well as the nature
    of representation. Why were chariots used in the desert and why were they represented
    in such different ways?

  body: The chariot has been one of the great empowering innovations of history. It
    likely originated in Mesopotamia about 3000 BC due to advances in metallurgy during
    the Bronze Age, and has served as a primary means of transport until quite recently
    in the historical period across Africa, Eurasia and Europe. Chariots provided
    rapid and efficient transport, and were ideal for the battlefield as the design
    provided a raised firing platform for archers . As a result the chariot became
    the principal war machine from the Egyptians through to the Romans; and the Chinese,
    who owned an army of 10,000 chariots. Indeed, our use of the word car is a derivative
    of the Latin word carrus, meaning ‘a chariot of war or of triumph’.

  body: The chariot in the Sahara was probably introduced by the Garamantes, a cultural
    group thought to be descended from Berbers and Saharan pastoralists. There is
    little textual information about the Garamantes, documentation comes mainly from
    Greek and Roman sources. Herodotus described them as ‘a very great nation’. Recent
    archaeological research has shown that the Garamantes established about eight
    major towns as well as numerous other settlements, and were ‘brilliant farmers,
    resourceful engineers, and enterprising merchants’. The success of the Garamantes
    was based on their subterranean water-extraction system, a network of underground
    tunnels, allowing the Garamantian culture to flourish in an increasingly arid
    environment, resulting in population expansion, urbanisation, and conquest.

  body: On average there are about 500 drawings of chariots across the Sahara, from
    the Fezzan in Libya through the Aïr of Niger into northern Mali and then westward
    to the Atlantic coast; but not all were produced by the Garamantes. It is still
    not certain that chariots were driven along the routes where their depictions
    occur; remains of chariots have never been found west of the Fezzan. However,
    the Fezzan states were thriving trade routes and chariots are likely to have been
    used to transport salt, cloth, beads and metal goods in exchange for gold, ivory
    and slaves. The widespread occurrence of chariot imagery on Saharan rock outcrops
    has led to the proposition of ‘chariot routes’ linking North and West Africa.
    However, these vehicles were not suited for long-distance transport across desert
    terrain; more localised use is probable, conducted through middlemen who were
    aware of the trade routes through the desert landscape. Additionally, the horse
    at this time was a prestige animal and it is unlikely that they facilitated transport
    across the Saharan trade routes, with travellers rather utilising donkeys or oxen.

  body: The absence of archaeological evidence for chariots has led to the suggestion
    that some representations of chariots may have been the result of cultural diffusion,
    transmitted orally by nomadic peoples traversing the region. Artists may never
    have actually seen the vehicles themselves. If this is the case, chariot symbols
    may have acquired some special meaning above their function as modes of transport.
    It may also explain why some representations of chariots do not seem to conform
    to more conventional styles of representations and account for the different ways
    in which they were depicted.

    Figs. 7 and 8 may or may not depict chariots. The rectangular shape in the top left of Fig. 7 and to the left in Fig. 8 are potentially abstracted forms of the chariot similar to the ‘flattened out’ depictions above in Figs. 5 and 6. The representation in Fig. 7 sits alongside distinguishing figures of the Horse Period when chariots were being used, such as geometric bi-triangular figures, spears or lances, women wearing long dresses, and animals drawn in a fairly naturalistic style.

    Beside the schematic and simply depicted chariots, there is also a group which has been termed the ‘flying gallop chariots’ (Fig.3 above and Fig. 9 below). Their distribution includes the whole Tassili region, although there are fewer in the Acacus Mountains. They resemble the classical two-wheeled antique chariots, generally drawn by two horses, but sometimes three, or even four. The driver is usually alone, and is depicted in a typical style with a stick head. The majority are shown at full speed, with the driver holding a whip standing on a small platform, sometimes straining forward.

    In a similar manner to the schematic chariots, the depictions in Figs. 3 and 9 display the entire platform and both wheels of the chariot. In addition, more than one horse is depicted as a single horse in profile with numerous legs indicating multiple horses; an artistic technique first seen during the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe. Interestingly, in the Libyan rock art of the Acacus Mountains it seemed that animals could be conceived of in profile and in movement, but chariots were conceived of differently, and are represented in plain view, seen from above or in three-quarters perspective.

    Why are chariots depicted in a variety of ways, and what can we say about the nature of representation in relation to chariots? It is clear that chariots are able to be depicted in profile view (Fig. 1), yet there are variations that digress from this perspective. In relation to the few examples we have come across so far in the Acacus Mountains in south-western Libya, one observation we might make is that the ways in which chariots have been represented may be indicative of the ways in which they have been observed by the artists representing them; as a rule from above. The rock shelters in the Acacus are often some height above the now dried up wadis, and so the ways in which they conceived of representing the chariot itself , whether as a flying gallop chariot, a chariot drawn by a bovid or as an abstraction, may have become a particular representational convention. The ways in which animals were represented conformed also to a convention, one that had a longer tradition, but chariots were an innovation and may have been represented as they were observed; from higher up in the rockshelters; thus chariots were conceived of as a whole and from an aerial perspective. The ways in which environments affect our perceptions of dimension, space and colour are now well-established, initially through cross-cultural anthropological studies in the 1960s, and becoming better understood through more recent research concerning the brain. Of course, this is speculation, and further research would be needed to consider all the possibilities. But for now, we can start to see some intriguing lines of enquiry and research areas that these images have stimulated.

    of goods, but the routes served as a conduit for cultural diffusion through the
    spread of knowledge, ideas and technologies. Chariots were both functional and
    symbolic. As a mode of transport, as a weapon of war, as a means of trade and
    exchange and as a symbol of power, the chariot has been a cultural artefact for
    4,000 years. Its temporal and spatial reach is evident not only in the rock art,
    but through the British Museum collections, which reveal comparisons between 2D
    rock art and 3D artefacts. Similarities and adjacencies occur not only in the
    structure and design of the chariots themselves but in their symbolic and pragmatic
    nature (Figs. 10–14).

    We have recently documented a particularly interesting set of images from Uan Amil, at Wadi Teshuinat in the Acacus Mountains, south-western Libya, which reflect the cultural significance of hair in African societies. The scenes depict groups of people engaged in a variety of communal social practices wearing elaborate coiffures (Fig. 1), together with some very discrete moments of personal hairdressing.

    The image below (Fig. 2), which is part of a larger panel (Fig. 3), shows an intimate moment between two persons, an individual with an ornate coiffure washing or attending to the hair of another. In some African societies, a person’s choice of hairdresser is dictated by their relationship to them. It is most often the work of friends or family to whom you entrust your hair. In the hands of a stranger or adversary hair can be used as an ingredient in the production a powerful substance that could afflict its owner; such is the potency of hair. This image well conveys such intimacy.

    Joint Archaeological Mission surveying in the Acacus and Messak regions of Libya.
    Excavations have indicated the shelter was in use over a long period, with at
    least three main occupational phases between the 8th and 4th millennium BP. Italian
    archaeologist Fabrizio Mori has dated these paintings to 6,000 years ago, while
    David Coulson has been more cautious and has suggested that the presence of a

    more recent age. Notwithstanding the problems associated with the dating of rock
    art, the subject matter is intriguing. It has been suggested that today’s Wodaabe
    nomads of Niger resemble the people on these rock paintings: ‘the cattle look
    the same, as do the campsites with their calf-ropes, and the women’s hairstyles
    with the special bun on the forehead. The female hair bun is big and round like

    The Wodaabe number around 125,000. As pastoral nomads they migrate often and over large geographical areas, keeping mahogany-coloured Zebu cattle which have a hump on their back and long horns, shaped like a lyre. As a cultural group they have attracted much anthropological attention because of their traditional values of beauty (in particular the male beauty pageant) which pervades their everyday lives and practices.

    Wodaabe seldom wash their entire bodies mainly because of the scarcity of water. Water from wells is mainly used for drinking by humans and animals. Washing the body and clothes is less of a priority; and hair is hardly ever washed. When Wodaabe put rancid butter on their hair it is to make it soft and shiny and cleanse it of dust and lice. To them rancid butter gives a nice sweet smell (Bovin, 2011: 56). Fig. 2 shows a vessel sitting between the two individuals that may have served to hold rancid butter used in the preparation of the hair; in fact, treating the hair with butter is a widespread practice in African societies. In addition, Wodaabe never cut their hair; everybody (men and women alike) want to have hair as long as possible, as represented in Figs. 2 and 5. The ideal girl should have long, thick, black hair, enough to make a huge round bun on her forehead, while the ideal young male should have long, thick black hair to make braids to the shoulders.

    A long, narrow face is also admired and this is enhanced by shaping the hair on top of the head, and also using an ostrich feather to elongate the face (Bovin, 2001:26). The painting in Fig. 4, also from Wadi Teshuinat, characterises this.

    Interestingly, the coiffures in Figs. 1, 2 and 3 are light in colour and do not conform to the black ideal as indicated above. It has been suggested that this represents Caucasians with blonde hair. However, it may also be a visual strategy to emphasise the aesthetics of the coiffure. Hairstyles in African sculpture are often shown conceptually, rather than mimetically; idealising rather than copying exactly from contemporary hairdressing practices. In this respect representation follows artistic traditions as much as, or more than, it responds to ephemeral shifts in fashion.

    an active element within more complex social and cultural activities. Fig. 3 has
    been interpreted as showing preparations for a wedding, while Fig. 5/6 is understood
    as a scene of supplication, with people visiting a man in a curved shelter; it
    may even be a representation of the cave. In addition, the C-shaped feature has
    been suggested to be a coiled snake and the figure sits between the head and tail.
    It may seem incongruous to have hair preparation scenes represented within a tableau
    representing a wedding or ceremonial meeting, but may say something more about
    the nature of representation. In each case, these may represent a conceptual depiction
    of time and space. These activities are not ones that occur concurrently temporally
    and spatially, but rather represent an assemblage of discrete moments that contribute

    and the need to beautify and refine. ‘Art’ is not just something that is aesthetically
    pleasing; it is a necessity of life, a necessity that must be exhibited. While
    there are likely to be a variety of complex social, economic and cultural motivations,
    that necessity is possibly additionally driven or fuelled by a seemingly desolate,
    unadorned, irregular landscape. The importance lies in distinguishing oneself
    as a cultural being rather than the ‘uncultured other’, such as an animal; and
    hair is an apposite medium by which to make this nature/culture distinction. Hair
    care in African societies is unmistakably aesthetic in its aspirations as it gets
    transferred into other artistic mediums, and the divide between nature and culture
    is thoroughly and intentionally in play. To transform hair is to transform nature,
    and is truly an artistic discipline.

    to Africa- is usually cited at around 1,600 BC, linked with the arrival in Egypt
    of the Hyksos, a group from the Levant who ruled much of Northern Egypt during
    the Second Intermediate Period. By this point, horses had probably only been domesticated
    for about 2,000 years, but with the advent of the chariot after the 3rd millennium
    BC in Mesopotamia, the horse proved to be a valuable martial asset in the ancient
    world. One of the first clear records of the use of horses and chariots in battle
    in Africa is found in depictions from the mortuary complex of the Pharaoh Ahmose
    at Abydos from around 1,525 BC, showing their use by Egyptians in defeating the
    Hyksos, and horses feature prominently in later Egyptian art.

    more horses pulling a chariot with their legs outstretched in a stylised manner

    a thousand miles from the Nile- how and when did the horse and chariot first make
    their way across the Western Desert to the rest of North Africa in the first place?
    Egyptian accounts indicate that by the 11th century BC Libyans (people living
    on the north African coast around the border of modern Egypt and Libya) were using
    chariots in war. Classical sources later write about the chariots of the Garamantes

    in rock art occur in various areas of Morocco, Egypt and Sudan and are particularly
    notable in the Ennedi region of Chad and the Adrar and Tagant plateaus in Mauritania
    (interestingly, however, no definite images of horses are known in the Gilf Kebir/Jebel
    Uweinat area at the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya).

  title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 5'
  body: Traditional chronologies for Saharan rock art areas tend to place depictions
    of ridden horses chronologically after those of horses and chariots, and in general
    use horse depictions to categorise regional stylistic periods of rock art according
    to broad date boundaries. As such, in most places, the ‘horse’ rock art period
    is usually said to cover about a thousand years from the end of the 2nd millennium
    BC. It is then considered to be succeeded by a ‘camel’ period, where the appearance
    of images of dromedaries – known only to have been introduced to the eastern Sahara
    from Arabia at the end of the 1st century BC – reflects the next momentous influx
    of a beast of burden to the area and thus a new dating parameter (read more about
    depictions of camels in the Sahara). However, such simplistic categorisation can
    be misleading. For one thing, although mounting horses certainly gained popularity
    over driving them, it is not always clear that depictions of ridden horses are
    not contemporary with those of chariots. Further, the horse remained an important
    martial tool after the use of war-chariots declined. Even after the introduction
    of the camel, there are several apparently contemporary depictions featuring both
    horse and camel riders.

  title: Berber Horses
  title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 6'
  body: As the more manoeuvrable rider rose in popularity against the chariot as a
    weapon of war, historical reports from classical authors like Strabo tell us of
    the prowess of African horsemen such as the cavalry of the Numidians, a Berber
    group that allied with Carthage against the Romans in the 3rd century BC. Berber
    peoples would remain heavily associated with horse breeding and riding, and the
    later rock art of Mauritania has been attributed to Berber horsemen, or the sight
    of them. Although horses may already have reached the areas of modern Mauritania
    and Mali by this point, archaeological evidence does not confirm their presence
    in these south-westerly regions of the Sahara until much later, in the mid-1st
    millennium AD, and it has been suggested that some of the horse paintings in Mauritania
    may be as recent as 16th century.

    the introduction of equipment such as saddles with structured trees (frames).
    Indeed, discernible images of such accoutrements in Saharan rock art can help
    to date it following the likely introduction of the equipment to the area: for
    example, the clear depiction of saddles suggests an image to be no older than
    the 1st century AD; images including stirrups are even more recent.'

  body: 'Another intriguing possibility is that of gaining clues on the origins of
    modern horse breeds from rock art, in particular the ancient Barb breed native
    to the Maghreb, where it is still bred. Ancient Mesopotamian horses were generally
    depicted as heavily-built, and It has been suggested that the basic type for the
    delicate Arabian horse, with its dished (concave) facial profile and high-set
    tail, may have been developed in north-east Africa prior to its subsequent appearance
    and cultivation in Arabia, and that these features may be observed in Ancient
    Egyptian images from the New Kingdom. Likewise, there is the possibility that
    some of the more naturalistic paintings from the central Sahara show the similarly
    gracile features of the progenitors of the Barb, distinguishable from the Arab
    by its straight profile and low-set tail. Like the Arab, the Barb is a desert
    horse: hardy, sure-footed and able to withstand great heat; it is recognised as
    an ancient breed with an important genetic legacy, both in the ancestry of the
    Iberian horses later used throughout the Americas, and that of the modern racing
    thoroughbred.'

    alone, especially given the gulf of time that has elapsed and the relative paucity
    of ‘naturalistic’ rock art images. Indeed, there is huge diversity of horse depictions
    throughout northern Africa, with some forms highly schematic. This variation is
    not only in style – and, as previously noted, in time period and geography – but
    also in context, as of course images of one subject cannot be divorced from the
    other images around them, on whichever surface has been chosen, and are integral
    to these surroundings.

    symbolism and implied value of the horse image in different cultural contexts.
    Where some Tassilian horses are delicately painted in lifelike detail, the stockier
    images of horses associated with the so-called ‘Libyan Warrior’ style petroglyphs
    of the Aïr mountains and Adrar des Ifoghas in Niger and Mali appear more as symbolic
    accoutrements to the central human figures and tend not to be shown as ridden.
    By contrast, there are paintings in the Ennedi plateau of Chad where galloping
    horse figures have clearly been painted over existing walking human figures to
    make them appear as if riding.

    In each of these cases, the original symbolic intent of the artists have been lost to time, but with these horse depictions, as with so much African rock art imagery, there is great scope for further future analysis. Particularly intriguing, for example, are the striking stylistic similarities in horse depictions across great distances, such the horse depictions with bi-triangular bodies (e.g. figs 5 &13), or with fishbone-style tails which may be found almost two thousand miles apart in Chad and Mauritania.

    Whatever the myriad circumstances and significances of the images, it is clear that following its introduction to the continent, the hardy and surefooted desert horse’s usefulness for draught, transport and fighting purposes transformed the societies which used it and gave it a powerful symbolic value.

  title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 1'
  body: Somalia is a country located at the corner of the Horn of Africa, bordered
    by Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya. Somaliland self-declared independence from Somalia
    in 1991 although the government of Somalia has not recognised this and views it
    as an autonomous region. A cultural and economic crossroads between Middle East,
    Africa and Asia, this area has historically been the centre of trade routes that
    linked these regions. It also has a very rich rock art heritage which has only
    recently been started to be studied in depth. Most of the known depictions correspond
    to painted or engraved cattle scenes, often accompanied by human figures, dogs
    and other domestic animals, although some warriors, camels and geometric symbols
    (sometimes interpreted as tribal marks) are common too.

  title: Geography and rock art distribution
  title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 2'
  body: 'The geography of Somaliland is characterized by a coastal semi-desert plain
    which runs parallel to the Gulf of Aden coast, crossed by seasonal rivers (wadis)
    which make possible some grazing during the rainy season. Farther to the south,
    this semi-desert plain gives rise to the Karkaar Mountains. These mountains, which
    run from Somaliland into the region of Puntland in Somalia, have an average height
    of 1800 meters above sea level and run west to east until Ras Caseyr (Cape Guardafui)
    where the north and east coasts of the Horn of Africa meet. Southward to the mountains
    there is a big, dry plateau known as the Ogo, whose western part (the Haud) is
    one of the few good grazing areas in the country. The Ogo plateau occupies much
    of central and eastern Somalia, which to the south is characterized by the two
    only permanent rivers in the country, the Jubba and the Shabeele, born in the
    Ethiopian highlands and running to the south. Regarding rock art, the distribution
    of the known rock art sites shows a high concentration in Somaliland, with only
    some sites located to the south in the Gobolka Hiiraan region. However, this distribution
    could be a result of lack of research in other areas. '

  title: Research history
  title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 3'
  body: A reconstruction of rock art research history is challenging due to its contemporary
    history. To begin with, during the colonial period the country was divided in
    three different territories (British, Italian and French) with very different
    trajectories, until 1960 when the British and Italian territories joined to create
    Somalia. In British Somaliland the first studies of rock art were carried out
    by Miles Burkitt and P.E. Glover in the 1940s, and the first general overview
    was published in 1954 by J.D. Clark, as a part of a regional synthesis of the
    Horn of Africa prehistory, followed by limited research done by Italians in the
    north-east region in the late 1950s. Since then, research has been limited, with
    some general catalogues published in the 1980s and 1990s, although political instability
    has often prevented research, especially in the south-eastern region of Somalia.
    In fact, most rock art information comes from wider regional syntheses dedicated
    to the Horn of Africa.  In the early 2000’s the discovery of the Laas Geel site
    led to a renewed interest in rock art in Somaliland, which has allowed a more
    systematic study of archaeological sites. Nowadays, about 70 of these sites have
    been located only in this area, something which shows the enormous potential of
    rock art studies in the Horn of Africa.

  title: Themes
  title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 4'
  body: The rock art has traditionally been ascribed to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabican
    style, a term coined by Pavel Červiček in 1971 to remark the strong stylistic
    relationship between the rock art found in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian
    Peninsula. According to this proposal, there was a progressive evolution from
    naturalism to schematism, perceptible in the animal depictions throughout the
    region. Wild animals seem to be largely absent but for Djibouti, while cattle
    depictions seem to have been fundamental elsewhere, either isolated or in herds.
    Such is the case with rock art in this region, where cows and bulls are the most
    common depictions, in many cases associated to human figures in what seems to
    be reverential or ritual scenes. In some of the sites, such as Laas Geel, the
    necks of the cows have been decorated with complex geometric patterns interpreted
    as a kind of mat used in special occasions to adorn them.

  body: Along with cattle, other animals were represented (humped cows or zebus, dogs,
    sheep, dromedaries), although to a much lesser extent. Wild animals are very rare,
    but giraffes have been documented in Laas Geel and elephants and antelopes in
    Tug Gerbakele, and lions are relatively common in the schematic, more modern depictions.
    Human figures also appear, either distributed in rows or isolated, sometimes holding
    weapons. Geometric symbols are also common, usually associated with other depictions.
    In Somalia, these symbols have often been interpreted as tribal or clan marks.
    With respect to techniques, both engraving and painting are common, although paintings
    seem to be predominant.

  title: Chronology
  title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 6'
  body: As in many other places, the establishment of accurate chronologies for Somaliland
    rock art is challenging. In this case, the lack of long term research has made
    things more difficult, and most hypotheses have been based in stylistic approaches,
    analysis of depictions and a small set of radiocarbon data and archaeological
    excavations. According to this, the oldest depictions could be dated to between
    the mid-3rd and the 2rd millennium BC, although older dates have been proposed
    for Laas Geel. This phase would be characterized by humpless cows, sheep and goats
    as well as wild animals. These sites would indicate the beginning of domestication
    in this region, the cattle being as a fundamental pillar of these communities.
    From this starting point the relative antiquity of the depictions would be marked
    by a tendency to schematism, visible in the superimpositions of several rock art
    sites. The introduction of camels would mark a chronology of the end of the first
    millennium BC, while the date proposed for the introduction of zebus (humped cows)
    should be placed at between the 1st Centuries BC and AD.

    fighting scenes against other warriors or lions. The moment when this last period
    of rock art ended is unknown, but in nearby Eritrea some of these figures were
    depicted with firearms, thus implying that they could have reached a relatively
    modern date.

    The first documentation of rock art in Uganda occurred in 1913 (Teso Report) at Nyero, a painted rock shelter of the Later Iron Age period. After its initial recording the site was subsequently cited in a 1945 excavation report (Harwich, 1961) and meticulously noted by J.C.D Lawrance during the 1950s. Only a small number of studies of Ugandan rock art rock art have been published (Wayland 1938; Lawrance 1953; Posnansky 1961; Morton 1967; Chaplin 1974), with early analyses being predominantly descriptive and highly speculative.

    The first major publications on Ugandan rock art emerged in the 1960s (Posnansky 1961; Morton 1967; Chaplin 1974) with rock art researchers proposing that the geometric and non-representational depictions served a documentary purpose of identifying cultural groups such as hunter-gatherers, cultivators or pastoralists. During this decade researchers attempted to place the rock art in a chronological framework, tying it to broader archaeological sequences. Political instability greatly impeded research during the 1970s and 1980s, although Chaplin’s thesis and in-depth survey on prehistoric rock art of Lake Victoria was published posthumously in 1974.

    Attempts to understand the chronology of Ugandan rock in the 1960s were based on sequences focusing on pigments used in paintings. Lawrance proposed that yellow paintings were the oldest; followed by orange, red, purple, red and white; white and dirty white were the latest in the sequence. It is highly problematic developing sequences based on pigments because of the ways in which they chemically react with particular surfaces, other pigments and the natural elements, which can compromise the integrity of the pigment. However, there appears to be a consistency (across East and Central Africa) that suggests red and white geometric paintings are the oldest and have been in existence for millennia.

    Initially thought to be the work of San Bushmen of southern Africa, archaeological, genetic and ethnographic evidence has subsequently attributed the paintings to the Batwa people, a cultural group who are today found in small groups near the Rwanda/Uganda border. If it is accepted that the geometric imagery was made by these hunter-gatherers then the rock art of Uganda probably dates from between 12,000 to 1,000 years ago.

    another site at Kakoro) has dated the paintings to between 5,000 and 1,600 years
    ago. It has been proposed that rock shelters were used by semi-nomadic peoples
    engaged in animal herding, which they used as reference points in the landscape.
    Generally positioned away from flat land, they may have served to direct herders
    of cattle and/or goats towards paths and water.

  title: Interpretation
  title_internal: 'Uganda: country, chapter 11'
  body: A recent comprehensive study (Namono, 2010) of the potential meaning of geometric
    art in Uganda looked at the ways in which the geometric shapes in the rock art
    can be associated with the ethnographies of hunter-gatherers of the region. The
    approach proposed that the symbolism of geometric rock art derives from a gendered
    forest worldview. The forest is pivotal to hunter/gatherer cosmology in this region,
    whereby it plays a central role in cultural production and reproduction over time
    and is regarded as both male and female. The forest is not only a source of subsistence
    and well-being but informs their identity and the rock art reflects these complex
    concepts.

    Historically, much of the rock art from across northern Africa has been classified according to a particular style or ‘school’ of depictions. One such category of images, known as the Libyan Warrior School or Libyan Warrior style is found predominantly in Niger. Typically, this style

    “…commonly depicts human figures, mainly armed warriors; women are very rare. The style is fairly crude and the technique unsophisticated, almost invariably a rather careless pecking. The figures, almost always presented frontally with their heads quite circular, with added lobes, or mushroom-shaped, are shown according to a symmetrical schema. Various garment decorations and feathers in the hair are common, and the warrior often holds one or two throwing-spears – the bow is almost lacking – and frequently also holds by the leading rein a typical horse; foreshortened with large hindquarters” (Muzzolini, 2001:614)

    Termed *Libyan Warriors* by French ethnographer Henri Lhote, these representations have been associated with Garamantes’ raids, possibly 2,500 years ago. Thought to be descended from Berbers and Saharan pastoralists who settled in central Libya from around 1500 BC, the Garamantes developed a thriving urban centre, with flourishing trade networks from Libya to Niger. In contrast, Francis Rodd, a military man who led two big expeditions to the Sahara in the 1920s, proposed that these figures represent Tuareg; a people reputedly of Berber descent who live a nomadic pastoralist lifestyle. They have their own script known as Tifinagh, which is thought to have Libyan roots and which is engraved onto rocks alongside other rock art depictions.

    Libyan Warrior figures are almost exclusively located in the Aïr Mountains of Niger although can also be found in the Adrar des Iforas, north-east Mali extending into Algeria.  Defining the Libyan Warrior Period chronologically is a challenge and dates are fairly fluid; the earliest dates suggested start from 5,200 years ago; it certainly coincides with the Horse period between 3,000-2,000 years ago but has also been proposed to continue throughout the Camel Period, from 2,000 years ago to present.

    From the sample of images we have as part of this collection it is clear that not all figures designated as falling under the umbrella term of Libyan Warrior style all share the same characteristics; there are similarities, differences and adjacencies even between what we may term a ‘typical’ representation. Of course, if these images span a period of 5,000 years then this may account for the variability in the depictions.

  body: However, for the majority of figures their posture is remarkably similar even
    though objects of material culture and the types of garments they wear may show
    more diversity. The overriding feature is that figures are positioned frontally
    with arms bent and raised, often displaying splayed fingers. In some cases figures
    hold weapons and shields, but some do not. Some wear obviously elaborate headdresses,
    but in others the features look more coiffure-like. Selected garments are decorated
    with geometric patterns, others are plain; not all wear items of personal ornamentation.
    Certainly, not all figures are associated with horses, as typically characterised.
    Moreover, rather than all being described as unsophisticated or careless, many
    are executed showing great technique and skill. So how do we start to make sense
    of this contradiction between consistency and variation?

    focused on other parts of Africa, is an under-theorisation of how the art links
    to past ethnic, archaeological or other identities (Smith,2013:156). This is tricky
    when dealing with past societies which were potentially nomadic, and where their
    archaeological remains are scarce. However, recent anthropological research may
    inform our thinking in this area. A member of the Wodaabe cultural group (nomadic
    cattle-herders and traders in the Sahel) on seeing a photograph of a Libyan-Warrior
    engraving and noting the dress and earrings told photographer Carol Beckwith that
    it represents a woman performing a traditional greeting dance with arms outstretched
    and about to clap (Coulson and Campbell,2001:210).

    of more recent rock art, that not all figures described as Libyan-Warrior may
    necessarily be the same; and indeed that women may not be as rare as previously
    documented. In fact, the Wodaabe have been noted to resemble figures in other
    Saharan rock art contexts (see article on Hairdressing in the Acacus).\n\nIf we
    accept that some of these representations share affinities with the Wodaabe then
    thinking about this category of images from an ethnographic perspective may prove
    productive. Moreover, the British Museum’s existing ethnographic collections are
    simultaneously a useful resource by which we can potentially add more meaning
    to the rock art images.\n\nThe Wodaabe belong to the Fulani people, numbering
    20 million and currently living across eighteen countries. The Wodaabe comprise
    2-3% of the Fulani cultural group, still live as true nomads and are considered
    to have the most traditional culture of all the Fulani (Bovin,2001:13).\t\n"

  body: "The Wodaabe have become particularly well-known in the West through visual
    anthropology, because of their emphasis on cultivating male personal beauty and
    adornment. Men invest enormous amounts of time in personal artistic expression;
    much more so than women. Anthropologists have documented the constant checking
    of Wodaabe men in their mirrors; a Wodaabe man will not even go out among the
    cows in the morning until he has checked and tidied himself. They spend hours
    every day on their appearance and have been described as styling themselves like
    “living paintings” and “living statues” (Bovin, 2001:72). Symmetry plays a particularly
    significant part in Wodaabe culture and is reflected in all their artistic expressions.
    Symmetry stands for culture, asymmetry stands for nature. Culture is order and
    nature is disorder (Bovin,2001:17). Everyday Wodaabe life is imbued with artistic
    expression, whereby “every individual is an active creator, decorator and performer
    (Bovin, 2001:15).\n\nSo, how might we see Wodaabe cultural traits reflected in
    the Libyan-Warrior figures?\n\nPlumage is often depicted on these Warrior figures
    and for the most part is assumed to simply be part of the warrior regalia. The
    ostrich feather, a phallic symbol in Wodaabe culture, is an important element
    in male adornment and is carefully placed in the axis of symmetry in the middle
    of a man’s turban, worn during dancing ceremonies (Bovin, 2001:41). Music and
    dancing are typical of Fulani traditions, characterized by group singing and accompanied
    by clapping, stomping and bells. The feathers in the British Museum’s collections
    are known to be dance ornaments, worn during particular ceremonies. \n"

    There is also a consensus within Wodaabe society about beauty and ugliness; what makes something beautiful or indeed ugly generally is agreed upon, there is a commonality of taste. This may account for the paradox of why there is individuality within a corpus of images that inherently are comparable (Bovin,2001:16).

    As nomads, Wodaabe do not identify themselves by place or territory as such, but a Wodaabe’s body is a repository of culture to mark them out against nature. Culture is not seen as an unessential indulgence but as an imperative necessity, it is part of one’s survival and existence in an inhospitable environment. We may speculate that rock art images may be seen as a way of stamping culture on nature; markers of socialised space.

    have categorised them as follows:\n\n*__Red Paintings__*:  \nRed paintings can
    be sub-divided into those found in central Tanzania and those found stretching
    from Zambia to the Indian Ocean.\nTanzanian red paintings include large, naturalistic
    animals with occasional geometric motifs. The giraffe is the most frequently painted
    animal, but antelope, zebra, elephant, rhino, felines and ostrich are also depicted.
    Later images show figures with highly distinctive stylised human head forms or
    hairstyles and body decoration, sometimes in apparent hunting and domestic scenes.
    The Sandawe and Hadza, hunter-gatherer groups, indigenous to north-central and
    central Tanzania respectively, claim their ancestors were responsible for some
    of the later art.\n\nThe area in which Sandawe rock art is found is less than
    100km in diameter and occurs at just a few hundred sites, but corresponds closely
    to the known distribution of this group. There have been some suggestions that
    Sandawe were making rock art early into the 20th century, linking the art to particular
    rituals, in particular simbo; a trance dance in which the Sandawe communicate
    with the spirit world by taking on the power of an animal. The art displays a
    range of motifs and postures, features that can be understood by reference to
    simbo and to trance experiences; such as groups of human figures bending at the
    waist (which occurs during the *simbo* dance), taking on animal features such
    as ears and tails, and floating or flying; reflecting the experiences of those
    possessed in the dance."

    dates of the 7th millennium BC, but the relationship with the rock art is unclear.  In
    the Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume site, the excavation at the cave provided a 1st millennium
    BC date, and the only radiocarbon date taken from the pigments at this site provided
    a date of the 1st century AD, which corresponds with other dates of the same style
    in Central Africa.  The second tool for assigning a chronology is the analysis
    of the subject matter represented in the rock art depictions: the presence of
    metal objects, for example, would imply a date of the 1st millennium AD onwards,
    when this material was introduced.  Whereas, depictions featuring images of firearms
    would date from the 16th century onwards.  The end of the rock art tradition has
    been associated with the presence of Europeans but was probably progressive as
    the control of the region by the Portuguese grew during the 17th and 18th centuries.  '

    symbols and anthropomorphic figures.  More recent depictions include axes, spears
    and firearms.  The latest period of the Angolan rock art includes complex scenes
    of war and hunting, and in a number of cases human figures carried on a palanquin-like
    structure.  Although schematic figures are widespread throughout the country,
    they are predominant in the south-west where most of the sites have been compared
    to those in the Central Africa Schematic Art zone, with parallels in Malawi and
    Mozambique.  In the west-central area of Angola, in addition to the schematic
    symbols and animals, images of men holding weapons, fighting and hunting are common,
    including warriors holding firearms which make reference to the first contact
    with Europeans by the 16th century.  Near the north-west coast, some of the paintings
    and engravings have been related to objects used in religious ceremonies –wooden
    statuettes or decorated pot lids.  In particular, a close association has been

    sites have also been discovered in the interior of the country, especially in
    its east-central region, and therefore this concentration in the coast could be

  title: Geography and rock art distribution
  title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 2'
  body: Angola has a variety of climates.  The flat coastal plain ranges between 25
    and 150 km in width, and is a semiarid region covered by scrub, turning into sand
    dunes to the south, near Namibia.  The coastal region abruptly gives way to a
    series of mountains and escarpments divided  by the Cuanza River.  The northern
    part has an average height of 500 m, but the southern region is far higher, with
    the peaks occasionally exceeding 2,300 m.  This mountainous region is in fact
    a transitional area between the coastal plain and the great central plateau of
    Africa.  This plateau dominates Angola’s geography with an altitude from 1,200
    to 1,800 m, and consists of a region of plains and low hills with a tropical climate.  The
    climate becomes drier to the south and wetter to the north, where a wide region
    of the country can be defined as rainforest.

    the Atlantic Ocean to the centre of the continent.  Angolan rock art consists
    both of  engravings and paintings, and is mostly located relatively near to the
    coast, although some sites have also been documented in the easternmost part of
    the country, near the border with Zambia.  Depictions are very varied, representing
    animals, human figures and geometric signs, in many cases grouped in hunting or
    war scenes.  In some cases, firearms appear represented, showing the period of
    contact with Europeans from the 1500s onwards.  '

  body: The question of who made the engravings or paintings is another complex issue
    for the interpretation of the Tchitundu-Hulu depictions.  The harsh conditions
    of this semi-desert area probably favoured a seasonal occupation of the region
    during the rainy season.  The location of Tchitundu-Hulu at the edge of the desert
    could also have made this place a strategic site for the communities living in
    the region.  Several local groups - Kwisi, Kuvale - have traditionally inhabited
    the area, but the authorship of these engravings and paintings and the motives
    for creating them remains obscure, as does the purpose and cultural context of
    the complex images of Tchitundu-Hulu.

    on the lithic tools dispersed throughout the area ascribed the paintings to an
    ancient time period, possibly  tens of thousands of years old.  Radiocarbon samples
    coming from the excavation of Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume showed a date in the early
    1st millennium BC, although the relation of the archaeological remains and the
    paintings has not been proved and archaeological materials of a more modern period
    were also located.  A sample taken from the pigments at the site rendered a date
    of the beginning of the first centuries of the 1st millennium AD.  In any case,
    Tchitundu-Hulu hosts some of the oldest examples of rock art in the country, and
    it has been linked to the schematic traditions that characterize the rock art
    of Central Africa, more abundant in central Mozambique and Malawi.  '

    __Late White__

    Late White paintings are crude, finger painted images and often superimpose older images. These were made by Bantu-speaking, iron-working farmers who moved into the region in the last 300-500 years.  The most common type of depiction are designs and motifs that include circles, some of which have rays emanating outwards,  concentric circles, patterns of dots and grids with outlines, what look like stick figures with multiple arms, as well as handprints. Animal depictions include giraffe, elephant, antelope, snakes, reptiles, baboons and domestic species. Human figures are less common, but when present are notably men facing forwards with hands on hips, sometimes holding weapons.

    instances, all three types occur at the same site. \n\nNo paintings have been
    scientifically dated, but some researchers have proposed the earliest dates for
    the art: Anati (1996) has suggested paintings at Kondoa may be up to 40,000 years
    old; Leakey (1985) and Coulson and Campbell (2001) up to 10,000 years old. Masao
    (1979) has estimated the earliest art at perhaps 3000 years old. These are estimates
    and not based on radiometric dating techniques, and as the paintings have been
    exposed to considerable weathering these very early dates currently cannot be
    substantiated.\n\n__Hunter-gatherer__\n\nHunter-gatherer or Sandawe rock art is
    characterised by fine-line paintings and includes images of animals, human figures,
    handprints and circular designs. These are the earliest paintings, thought to
    date to between 3,000-10,000 years ago, and are attributed to the ancestral Sandawe,
    a hunter-gatherer group indigenous to north-east Tanzania. \n\nThis tradition
    of rock art occurs in the Kondoa region, with just a few hundred sites in a concentration
    of less than a 100km in diameter and corresponding closely to the known distribution
    of the Sandawe people. Animals, such as giraffe, elephant, rhinoceros, antelope,
    plus a few birds and reptiles, dogs and possibly bees, make up more than half
    of the images depicted. In addition there are a few animal tracks depicted: cloven

    Situated within the Great Lakes Region of East Africa, Tanzania is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and the Indian Ocean to the east, with a coastline of approx. 800km. At 947,303 km², Tanzania is the largest country in East Africa and is home to Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro (5,895 m, 19,340 feet), located in the north-east of the country.

    Central Tanzania is comprised largely of a plateau, which is mainly grassland and contains many national parks. The north of the country is predominantly arable and includes the national capital of Dodoma. The north-east of the country is mountainous and contains the eastern arm of the Great Rift Valley. Further north-west is Lake Victoria adjoining the Kenya–Uganda–Tanzania border. Concentrations of rock art are found mainly in the Kondoa province of central Tanzania and also the Lake Eyasi Basin in the north of the country.


    The rock art of the Lake Eyasi Basin and that of Kondoa share many similarities related to subject matter, styles, pigments and even types of sites. This may possibly reflect a shared art tradition among hunter-gatherers, which is feasible as there are no natural barriers preventing the movement of cultural ideas and techniques.

    __Pastoral__

    About 3,000 years ago, Cushitic herders from Ethiopia moved into the region, and were followed by Nilotic cattle pastoralists, ancestors of today’s Maasai. In comparison to hunter-gatherer rock art, Pastoral rock art yields many fewer paintings and generally depicts cattle in profile, and sometimes sheep and/or goats, a few dogs and figures holding sticks and bows. Predominantly painted in black and sometimes red and white, the colour of many images has now faded to a dull grey colour.

  title_internal: Tanzania Chapter 3
  body: 'The existence of painted rock art was first reported  to Europeans in 1908
    by missionaries, but the first scientific explorations date back to the 1930s.
    Early surveys were undertaken by Ludwig Kohl-Larsen (1958), a German physician,
    amateur anthropologist and explorer, who traced images in more than 70 rock shelters
    in 1935. The renowned paleoanthropologists Mary and Louis Leakey (1983) were the
    first to extensively study the rock art of Tanzania during the 1930s and 1950s
    (having noted many sites in the 1920s), documenting over 1600 painted images at
    186 sites north of Kondoa. In the late 1970s and during the 1980s Fidelis Masao
    (1979) surveyed 68 rock paintings sites and excavated four of them while Emmanuel
    Anati (1996) recorded 200 sites in Kondoa. Other researchers include Eric ten
    Raa (1971, 1974), David Lewis-Williams (1986), Imogene Lim (1992), and Emmanuel
    Bwasiri (2008, 2011); all of whom have recorded numerous sites, contributing to
    identifying chronologies, styles and possible interpretations. Conservation and
    preservation of the rock art has been of importance since the 1930s, and many
    of the paintings recorded by the Leakeys in the early 1950s are now severely deteriorated,
    or in some cases completely destroyed. '

Although inscribed onto the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2006, it has been noted paintings are being destroyed by the dust from the ground and in some cases rainwater is causing the paintings to deteriorate.

    Ritual Practices

    Ritual sites are generally located near fig and baobab trees, and springs. However, about 3 m south of the main Kolo shelter, a cavity underneath a huge boulder is used, even today, by local diviners, healers and rainmakers to invoke visions and communicate with the spirits. Oral traditions indicate that Mongomi wa Kolo is considered more powerful than other ritual places in Kondoa, and its unusual location may contribute to its efficacy.  The other two shelters of Kolo 2 and 3 are also used for ritual ceremonies.

    eland, rhinoceros and wildebeest; while human figures are represented as slender
    and elongated, often with elaborate hairstyles or headdresses, holding bows and
    arrows. Groups of figures are also shown bent at the waist, with some appearing
    to take on animal characteristics. These paintings have been associated with Sandawe
    cultural beliefs. \n\nThe Sandawe communicate with the spirits by taking on the
    power of an animal and some features at Mongomi wa Kolo can be understood by reference
    to the Sandawe traditional practice known as simbó (Ten Raa 1971, 1974). Developing
    Ten Raa’s observations, Lewis-Williams (1986) proposed that simbó is the ritual
    of being a lion, and that simbó dancers are believed to turn into lions. Lim (1992,
    1996) adopted a site-specific approach to the rock art and has suggested that
    the importance of place is as important as the images themselves. According to
    Lim the potency of a place is produced through ritual activities, so that meaning
    resides in the process of painting in a particular location, rather than in the
    painted image itself.  \n"

  body: "The sites at Kolo are the most famous of the Kondoa paintings. Kolo comprises
    three rock art sites, known as Kolo 1, 2 and 3. The main site, Kolo 1 (known locally
    as Mongomi wa Kolo) is a large, imposing rock shelter that is only accessible
    by following a winding path at the end of a dirt road. This site contains many
    fine-line red paintings, some of which are very faded; but the site is still used
    by the local community for secret rituals. Kolo 2 is located south of the main
    site and includes human and animal figures, while Kolo 3 is north of Kolo1 and
    is characterised by human, animal and geometric figures. The renowned palaeontologist
    Mary Leakey surveyed and documented many of the paintings at Kolo in the 1950s.
    \ The examples we see here are thought to have been made by early hunter-gatherer
    groups, ancestors of the modern Sandawe, one of the first cultural groups to inhabit
    Kondoa.   \n\n"

  body: The Kondoa rock art sites are located on the eastern slopes of the Maasai
    escarpment, which borders the western side of the Great Rift Valley in central
    Tanzania, covering an area of over 2,336 km². Stretching for around 18 km along
    the escarpment, the exact number of rock art sites in the Kondoa area is unknown
    but is estimated to be up to 450, the oldest of which are thought be more than
    2,000 years old. The extensive and spectacular collection of rock paintings are
    attributable to both hunter-gatherer and pastoralist communities and the images
    are testament to the changing socio-economic environment in the region. The hunter-gatherer
    rock paintings of Kondoa are dominated by human figures and animals. While a dark
    reddish brown predominates, other colours include yellow, orange, red and white.  Some
    of the shelters are still considered to have cultural associations with the people
    who live nearby, reflecting their beliefs, rituals and cosmological traditions.
    In 2006, Kondoa was nominated and listed as one of UNESCO’s World Heritage rock
    art sites in Africa.

    than the white ones, the exact chronology of these styles is still under discussion.  The
    earliest evidence for human occupation in the region according to the archaeological
    record is around 2,500 years ago, and it is generally assumed that Late Stone
    Age hunters and gatherers made this rock art. Unfortunately no datable evidence
    has been found although groups of these people survived until the 1800s in Malawi.
    For the white paintings, chronologies are more accurate: the Chewa people are

    painting traditions were still alive in the mid-20th century.  '

    by white figures made with white clay daubed onto rock surfaces with the finger.
    Associated with the agriculturalist Chewa people, the depictions usually represent
    zoomorphic, spread-eagled or snake-like figures which could represent mythological
    beings, sometimes accompanied by geometric symbols.  As in the case of the schematic
    figures, two types of paintings have been proposed: those related to spread-eagled
    figures and those representing zoomorphs (animal-like figures). The paintings
    were made until several decades ago, as testified by depictions of cars that can
    be found at some sites. In this case, the interpretation of the paintings is straightforward,
    as the images depicted can still be related to current rituals often employing
    masks in a variety of shapes.  The spread-eagled paintings may be associated with
    a Chewa girl’s initiation ceremony and would act as a mnemonic tool during the
    ritual, while the zoomorphic paintings may depict spirit characters of the Chewa
    men’s secret society, the *nyau*. In many cases, these paintings can overlap the

    paintings with parallels in Central Africa from Malawi to Angola. These paintings
    are associated with the ancestors of modern Batwa hunter-gatherers, and can be
    classified into two different types. The first can be considered the most characteristic
    and is represented by circles with radiating lines, concentric circles, ovals,
    wavy or parallel lines. In some cases, red figures are infilled in white painting
    or white dots. The second type is very scarce (only two examples have been found
    in Chongoni) and depicts very schematic animals, sometimes accompanied by humans.
    Both types are finely executed with red oxide pigment. Regarding their interpretation,
    the figures seem to have been associated with rainmaking and fertility concepts. '

    published, and it was only in 1978 a first synthesis on Malawian rock art was
    undertaken (Lindgren, N.E.  & Schoffeleers, J.M. 1978). In the 1980s research
    increased, especially on Chongoni rock art as its importance as a secret society
    artefact became evident. In 1995 the Chongoni rock art area was comprehensively
    studied by Benjamin Smith as a part of his doctoral research (1995), which is
    still the main reference on the topic. Most of the research on Malawi rock art
    has focused on the study of the two different painting traditions found in Malawi.
    A basic proposal was made in 1978 when the red paintings—mostly geometric—considered
    older and attributed to hunter-gatherers, while white paintings were related to
    more modern groups of farmers which arrived early in the 2nd millennium AD and
    preserved their painting traditions until the 1950s. Since 1978, the knowledge
    of these two groups has substantially improved, with a more refined proposal made

  body: "Malawi is a landlocked country in south-eastern Africa, located between Mozambique,
    Tanzania and Zambia. It stretches from north to south with the eastern boundary
    of the country marked by the Lake Malawi. Rock art can be found throughout the
    country but is especially abundant in central Malawi, near the western border
    with Mozambique. It consists exclusively of paintings attributed to two very distinctive
    groups (hunter-gatherers and farmers), and shows obvious links with other sites
    located in Zambia and western Mozambique. The images consist mainly of animals,
    anthropomorphic figures and geometric symbols, with a chronology that ranges from
    the Late Stone Age to the 1950s.  \n"

  body: "Paintings associated to the *nyau* secret society were used during a very
    specific period of time (before that other styles of white paintings were used),
    when the secret society was persecuted first by Ngoni invaders in the 19th century,
    then by missionaries and colonial governments in the 20th century. With their
    traditional practices and places forbidden, the members of this society had to
    look for alternative ways to teach the secrets of the secret society secrets,
    with the paintings starting to represent *nyau* objects, to be used as a didactic
    tool.  The Namzeze paintings show very explicitly the adaptability of societies
    to their different challenges and historical contexts. Either as a tool to summon
    the rain or as a coded message to transmit sacred secrets, the painted symbols
    depicted in Namzeze show the incredible complexity of rock art meanings throughout
    time, and their importance for the communities that painted them.  \n"

    animals depicted in this panel corroborate with this interpretation: the shape
    of the hooves which is more similar to feet, and the fact that in some cases the
    feet of the forelegs and the hind legs are facing each other, as if they corresponded

    are kept in secret, hidden from non-initiates.  The white paintings of Namzeze

  body: The second type of painting found in Namzeze is radically different and depicts
    mainly quadrupeds and birds, as well as some geometric symbols and a car, proof
    of a relatively recent date for some of these paintings. Quadrupeds have a very
    characteristic rectangular body and hooves that in some cases are represented
    as feet.  The technique is very different too, consisting of white clay daubed
    on the wall with the fingers.  These white figures usually appear surrounding
    the previous depictions, in some rare occasions overlapping them.  In this case,
    the authorship, chronology and interpretation of the paintings are more straightforward.  Researchers
    agree that these types of paintings have been made by the Chewa, a group of farmers
    that arrived to the region around the 16th century and have maintained rock art
    painting traditions until the 20th century (as the car represented in this shelter
    proves).

    to ancestors of  Batwa people, hunter-gatherers, who inhabited the region until
    the 1800s.  Studies of Batwa ethnography and cosmology point to these places as
    related to fertility and rainmaking ceremonies.  It is difficult to establish

  body: 'Paintings associated to the *nyau* secret society were used during a very
    specific period of time (before that other styles of white paintings were used),
    when the secret society was persecuted first by Ngoni invaders in the 19th century,
    then by missionaries and colonial governments in the 20th century. With their
    traditional practices and places forbidden, the members of this society had to
    look for alternative ways to teach the secrets of the secret society secrets,
    with the paintings starting to represent *nyau* objects, to be used as a didactic
    tool.  The Namzeze paintings show very explicitly the adaptability of societies
    to their different challenges and historical contexts. Either as a tool to summon
    the rain or as a coded message to transmit sacred secrets, the painted symbols
    depicted in Namzeze show the incredible complexity of rock art meanings throughout
    time, and their importance for the communities that painted them.  '

    to the *nyau*, a secret society of the Chewa and other neighbouring groups in
    Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique which plays a significant role in funerary and girl’s
    initiation ceremonies.  The *nyau* rituals include dancing and rely heavily on
    the use of masks, including face masks as well as other mobile structures carried
    by one or two people.  These masks are central for the *nyau* secret society and
    are kept in secret, hidden from non-initiates.  The white paintings of Namzeze
    and many other sites have been interpreted as representations of masks, depicted
    during initiation ceremonies that took place in these isolated shelters where
    secrets of the *nyau* were explained to the new initiates.  '

    in the rock shelters.  The most common is the *kasiyamaliro*, a big structure
    representing an antelope, with a rectangular shape and meant to be carried by
    two people (an [excellent example](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=472359&partId=1)
    can be seen in Room 25 in the British Museum), but others, such as the *Galimoto*
    (a car structure) and birds are also documented.  Some of the features of the
    animals depicted in this panel corroborate with this interpretation: the shape
    of the hooves which is more similar to feet, and the fact that in some cases the
    feet of the forelegs and the hind legs are facing each other, as if they corresponded
    to two different people. Some researchers have interpreted this feature as a pictorial
    tool to teach people the proper way of wearing and using the structure toavoid
    stumbling, which would expose the men hidden in the structure and thus the secret
    of the mask would be revealed.  \n"

    \ Representations include a multitude of geometric signs: series of parallel lines,
    grid-style shapes, concentric ovals and circular shapes made with series of dots.
    \ In some cases the red signs were infilled with series of tiny white dots, a
    feature uncommon in the red schematic rock art depictions but with the best examples
    represented here in Namzeze.  Its interpretation, as with most geometric depictions,
    is a challenging issue, but these types of paintings have been traditionally related
    to ancestors of  Batwa people, hunter-gatherers, who inhabited the region until
    the 1800s.  Studies of Batwa ethnography and cosmology point to these places as
    related to fertility and rainmaking ceremonies.  It is difficult to establish
    the chronology.  The oldest occupation documented in the region is dated to the
    mid-first millennium BC, and the red images precede the arrival of the Chewa people
    in the 2nd millennium AD, responsible for the white paintings style, but there
    is no datable evidence for the paintings.  \n"

    than the white ones, the exact chronology of these styles is still under discussion.  The
    earliest evidence for human occupation in the region according to the archaeological
    record is around 2,500 years ago, and it is generally assumed that Late Stone
    Age hunters and gatherers made this rock art. Unfortunately no datable evidence
    has been found although groups of these people survived until the 1800s in Malawi.
    For the white paintings, chronologies are more accurate: the Chewa people are
    thought to have arrived to central Malawi in the 15th century, and as aforementioned,
    painting traditions were still alive in the mid-20th century.  '

    by white figures made with white clay daubed onto rock surfaces with the finger.
    Associated with the agriculturalist Chewa people, the depictions usually represent
    zoomorphic, spread-eagled or snake-like figures which could represent mythological
    beings, sometimes accompanied by geometric symbols.  As in the case of the schematic
    figures, two types of paintings have been proposed: those related to spread-eagled
    figures and those representing zoomorphs (animal-like figures). The paintings
    were made until several decades ago, as testified by depictions of cars that can
    be found at some sites. In this case, the interpretation of the paintings is straightforward,
    as the images depicted can still be related to current rituals often employing
    masks in a variety of shapes.  The spread-eagled paintings may be associated with
    a Chewa girl’s initiation ceremony and would act as a mnemonic tool during the
    ritual, while the zoomorphic paintings may depict spirit characters of the Chewa
    men’s secret society, the nyau. In many cases, these paintings can overlap the
    older red paintings already existing at some sites'

  body: 'Rock art in Malawi is clearly defined in two groups with different styles,
    chronologies and production contexts. The first one is characterized by red schematic
    paintings with parallels in Central Africa from Malawi to Angola. These paintings
    are associated with the ancestors of modern Batwa hunter-gatherers, and can be
    classified into two different types. The first can be considered the most characteristic
    and is represented by circles with radiating lines, concentric circles, ovals,
    wavy or parallel lines. In some cases, red figures are infilled in white painting
    or white dots. The second type is very scarce (only two examples have been found
    in Chongoni) and depicts very schematic animals, sometimes accompanied by humans.
    Both types are finely executed with red oxide pigment. Regarding their interpretation,
    the figures seem to have been associated with rainmaking and fertility concepts. '

  body: The second type of painting found in Namzeze is radically different and depicts
    mainly quadrupeds and birds, as well as some geometric symbols and a car, proof
    of a relatively recent date for some of these paintings. Quadrupeds have a very
    characteristic rectangular body and hooves that in some cases are represented
    as feet.  The technique is very different too, consisting of white clay daubed
    on the wall with the fingers.  These white figures usually appear surrounding
    the previous depictions, in some rare occasions overlapping them.  In this case,
    the authorship, chronology and interpretation of the paintings are more straightforward.  Researchers
    agree that these types of paintings have been made by the Chewa, a group of farmers
    that arrived to the region around the 16th century and have maintained rock art
    painting traditions until the 20th century (as the car represented in this shelter
    proves).

    although it wasn’t until the 1950s when the first articles on the subject were
    published, and it was only in 1978 a first synthesis on Malawian rock art was
    undertaken (Lindgren, N.E.  & Schoffeleers, J.M. 1978). In the 1980s research
    increased, especially on Chongoni rock art as its importance as a secret society
    artefact became evident. In 1995 the Chongoni rock art area was comprehensively
    studied by Benjamin Smith as a part of his doctoral research (1995), which is
    still the main reference on the topic. Most of the research on Malawi rock art
    has focused on the study of the two different painting traditions found in Malawi.
    A basic proposal was made in 1978 when the red paintings—mostly geometric—considered
    older and attributed to hunter-gatherers, while white paintings were related to
    more modern groups of farmers which arrived early in the 2nd millennium AD and
    preserved their painting traditions until the 1950s. Since 1978, the knowledge
    of these two groups has substantially improved, with a more refined proposal made
    by Benjamin Smith in his doctoral dissertation.  '

    German geologist Siegfried Passarge visited the Tsodilo Hills on the 1st July 1898, mapping the area, writing on the geology and photographing a few rock paintings. In 1907, he published tracings of his photos in Die Buschmänner der Kalahari. A passing mention of the Hills was made in 1913 in a brief report by Max Happe, but it was François Balsan, a French industrialist and explorer, who raised the profile of Tsodilo Hills when over two days he photographed and prepared tracings of what has come to be known as the “Rhino Panel” on September 27-28 1951.

    Laurens van der Post’s publication of *The Lost World of the Kalahari* in 1958 brought Tsodilo Hills and its rock art to the attention of the wider world. Van der Post, an Afrikaner, had planned to make a film of the rock art in the region, but a number of events including the shooting of a steenbok (a severe crime locally), the cameras jamming and swarms of bees descending upon their camp, conspired against him and resulted in van der Post leaving the Hills in despair. However, he also left an apologetic note at the rock art panel he had been trying to film as a way of assuaging the wrath of the “Spirit of the Hills” as he put it. The rock face he was trying to film, comprising eland, giraffe and handprints, is now known as “Van der Post Panel”.

    In 1963 Alec Campbell visited the region with George Silberbauer, an ethnographer who had studied the San|Bushmen in Botswana. As Director of Botswana’s National Museum, Campbell had a little government funding to record the rock art and excavate the rock shelters. Subsequently he collaborated with archaeologists Larry Robbins, Mike Murphy, and paleo-geographer George Brook.

    During the 1990s, Campbell, along with the staff from the National Museum recorded around 400 rock art sites numbering over 4,000 individual paintings. In 2001 Tsodilo Hills became a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its spiritual significance to local peoples, as well as its unique record of human settlement over many millennia.

    Tuli Block is a narrow fringe of land in the far east of the country that borders South Africa and lies on the banks of the Limpopo River. This area is characterised by rock engravings of human and animal footprints, and cupules, which hold spiritual importance both for San|Bushman¹ hunter-gatherers and Tswana farmers. The engravings are thought to refer to a local myth that tells of an ancestor, named Matsieng, who is believed to have emerged from a waterhole followed by his animals. However, there are several localities in the region that claim this origin myth. It is thought the engravings in this area were created by the San|Bushmen and linked to their belief system, appropriated later by the Tswana farmers.

    The most renowned rock art in Botswana comes from the Tsodilo Hills in the north-west of the country. With more than 4,500 paintings preserved in an area of 10km² it has been termed the “Louvre of the Desert”.  Tsodilo is made up of four main hills; Male Hill, Female Hill, Child Hill and North Hill, and paintings occur on all four. The subject matter, comprised of red and white paintings, includes animals, human figures and geometric designs. Red paintings are likely to have been made by San|Bushmen, while the white paintings are more difficult to attribute authorship to but may be a later continuation of the red tradition. There are no engraved images at Tsodilo but cupules and ground grooves are a common feature.  Dating of the paintings at Tsodilo has been difficult, and because many of them occur on exposed surfaces where they are susceptible to damage by the sun, rain and wind, what remains is probably not very old. However, paintings of cattle, which are also badly faded, probably date to between AD 800 and 1150 when people kept these animals in this area.

    ¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

    It is difficult to determine exactly when the paintings were made, but excavation
    shows the use of ochre from the earliest occupation levels dating to the Late
    Stone Age, around AD 100 - 800, with the latest occupation levels dating to the
    Late Iron Age, around AD 1600-1700. Interestingly, none of the paintings were

    on the function and/or meanings of the art in relation to other rock art traditions
    in southern Africa.  These may include fertility, health, abundance, protection
    against evil spirits or summoning rain. Contemporary communities at Tsodilo Hills
    believe that spirits live in the Hills and have explained how those who enter
    the Hills must be respectful as the spirits are capable of both curing and punishing
    people. In particular, White Paintings Shelter in the Tsodilo Hills was used as
    a place to perform curative dances that involved the placing of hands on the paintings
    in order to use its power. Geometric designs are more difficult to interpret but
    may fit into a tradition of other geometric symbols in the region and represent
    weather and fertility symbols.

  title: Rock Art
  title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 2'
  body: The paintings at Tsodilo are unique in comparison to other San|Bushmen rock
    art in both techniques and subject matter. San|Bushmen paintings are well-known
    throughout southern Africa for their fine-line detail because they were brush
    painted, but those at Tsodilo are finger painted. In addition, 160 depictions
    of cattle are portrayed in the same style as wild animals, and more geometric
    designs appear here than anywhere else. Tsodilo animal drawings are larger and
    the geometric designs simpler than those found elsewhere.  In comparison to human
    figures elsewhere in southern Africa, those at Tsodilo appear without bows and
    arrows, clothing or any forms of personal ornamentation.  In addition, numerous
    cupules and grooves are incised and ground into rock surfaces, sometimes close
    to painted rock art sites and some on their own. For the residents of Tsodilo,
    the hills are a sacred place inhabited by spirits of the ancestors.

    some sites show figures. Some of these figures are with cattle as well as women
    standing in rows in connection with animal groups, possibly showing some relationship
    with each other. Additionally, some of the rock art in the Tsodilo Hills shows
    superimposition, but this occurs infrequently. In some cases red geometric designs
    superimpose animals, but geometric designs and animals never superimpose human
    figures, nor do images of cattle ever superimpose other images – which may suggest
    some kind of relationship or hierarchy.

  title: Cupules/Grooves
  title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 8'
  body: There are no engravings at Tsodilo representing animals or human figures,
    but more than 25 sites show evidence of small round depressions ground into the
    rock, known as cupules, as well as various shaped grooves that have been chipped
    and ground into the rock. The majority of sites are found on Female Hill, with
    four on Male Hill and one site on Child Hill. Cupules tend to measure about 5cm
    or more wide and less than a 1 cm deep, although larger examples occur. They can
    occur at painted rock art sites but also on their own. For the most part they
    are found in groups ranging from 5 to 100 and in three cases, considerably more.
    For example, in Rhino Cave there are 346 carved into a vertical wall and nearly
    1,100 at Depression Shelter. The purpose or meaning of cupules is unknown; they
    may have denoted a special place or the number of times a site had been visited.
    However, we have no dates for any of the cupules and even if they are adjacent
    to a rock art site, they are not necessarily contemporaneous. From their patina
    and general wear it has been proposed that some cupules may date back tens of
    thousands of years to the Middle Stone Age. If paintings also existed at this
    time they have long since disappeared.

    occur in small groups of 3 to 15 and are elongated oval or canoe-like in shape,
    and are found mostly on horizontal or near-horizontal surfaces. Their function
    is unknown, although a thin slab of stone with a curved round edge was excavated
    from Depression Shelter which matched one of the grooves in the shelter.

  title: Who were the artists?
  title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 10'
  body: "It is a bit of a mystery about who actually created the paintings at Tsodilo,
    as the red images at Tsodilo do not fit neatly into other known styles of rock
    art in southern Africa. They do not show the fine brush work of San|Bushmen¹ in
    other parts of southern Africa, nor the cruder style of white paintings attributed
    to later Bantu-speaking farmers.\n\nIt is possible that they were painted by the
    Khoesan during the first millennium AD, the original settlers in the area who
    made stone tools and herded livestock. A local Ncaekhoe man (a Central San people)
    claims his ancestors made the paintings and it is possible that some or many of
    the cattle images were painted by pastoral ancestors of Ncaekhoe. \n\nThe white
    paintings are more difficult to attribute authorship, although as they are comparable
    to the red paintings, comprising the same subject matter of elephant, rhino, giraffe
    and antelope as well as geometrics, they may reflect a later version of the red
    tradition.\n\n"

    Griqua traders who passed nearby on their way to Andara in 1852, the earliest
    probable date for the paintings of figures on horseback (Campbell, Robbins and
    Taylor, 2010:103). It is not clear when the red painting tradition ceased but
    this could have occurred in the twelfth century when Tsodilo stopped being a major
    trade centre and seemingly the local cattle population collapsed. '

  title: Dating
  title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 11'
  body: The paintings at Tsodilo are often faded because they are located on rock
    faces exposed to the sun, wind and rain. As such, dating them scientifically is
    problematic as little or no suitable organic material remains. However, cattle
    paintings may help to date the art. There are about 160 depictions of cattle,
    which were common around the Tsodilo Hills between 800–1200 AD. As the cattle
    depictions are stylistically similar to other animal depictions it has been suggested
    that this seems to be a plausible date for most of the art (Coulson and Campbell,
    2001:103)

  title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 13'
  body: "Giraffe, eland and rhino are by far the most common species depicted at Tsodilo,
    followed by elephant, gemsbok and cattle. However, these images tend to be discretely
    rendered and there does not appear to be any relationship between images on the
    same rock. \n\nRepresentations of people are simply painted and generally stick-like,
    identified to gender by either penis or breasts. In some cases this may represent
    sexual virility and fertility, although in scenes where both occur it may merely
    indicate gender differences.\n\nCattle seem to appear in the rock art at the same
    time as human figures. In one scene, three figures, one leading a child, has been
    interpreted as either herding or stealing cattle (Campbell, Robbins and Taylor,
    2010:106). Three other sites show cattle depicted with what may be mythical rain
    animals. \n"

  body: "Geometric designs are trickier to decipher.  Square geometric designs, also

    partially superimpose an animal or be placed within its outline. This superimposition
    may enhance the symbolic meaning of the animal.\n\nEither singly or in groups,
    and sometimes depicted with animals or people, geometric motifs show stylistic
    consistency across a wide area and are likely to have had some symbolic meaning.
    In Zambia, geometric designs are thought to have been be made by women and associated
    with the weather and fertility, while depictions of animals were made by men.
    The geometric rock art of Tsodilo fits into a pattern of similar imagery in central
    Africa and may be related to the same meanings of weather and fertility.\t\n"

  body: "Many of the depictions in the Matobo Hills are associated with hunter-gatherers,
    providing a great amount of information about the social, economic and spiritual
    life of these groups. Depictions of daily objects (bows, vessels, digging sticks,
    cloaks) appear depicted in the rock art, and humans are shown hunting animals,
    fighting other groups and dancing in what seem to be ritual scenes. In fact, many
    of the scenes show strong similarities to those found in the Drakensberg (South
    Africa), and part of the iconography in the Zimbabwean paintings – ‘therianthropes’
    (part-human, part-animal figures), elongated figures, rain animals, geometric
    figures – can be easily related to trance or rain-making activities similar to
    those seen in South Africa. These paintings have been interpreted as representing
    the trance experiences of shamans (the term ‘shaman’ is derived from Siberian
    concepts of Shamanism and its applicability to San|Bushman¹ cultures has been
    questioned, but it is utilised here on the understanding that it sufficiently
    represents trancers in this academic context, where it is the most frequently
    used term to describe them). However, unlike in South Africa, the Matobo Hills
    rock art is not recent and researchers lack the key ethnographic records that
    help us to interpret the paintings. Therefore, interpretations cannot be directly
    extrapolated from the South African paintings to those of the Matobo Hills, and
    researchers such as Peter Garlake have broadened the interpretative framework
    of this art to include social issues in addition to the religious. \n\n"

    with males being more numerous than women and children very rare. They are usually
    depicted in a slender style, facing left or right but with the upper part of the

    animals such as smaller antelopes, giraffes, zebras, ostriches, monkeys, eland
    antelope, rhinoceros and to a lesser extent carnivores are also depicted. The
    animals are represented in very different attitudes and may be depicted standing
    still, running or lying. Humans and animals are often related in hunting scenes.
    Along with animals and human figures, a fair number of geometric symbols are present,

  title: Chronology
  title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 6'
  body: "As with much rock art, the dating of Zimbabwe paintings is a challenging
    subject, although there is a consensus about them being significantly older than
    those of the Drakensberg and probably dated at before 2,000 years ago. The lack
    of any type of agriculture-related images in the paintings, which was established
    by the 1st millennium AD, sets a relative dating for the depictions, while the
    scarcity of sheep (introduced by the second half of the first millennium BC in
    the area) points to a time period in which these animals were still uncommon.
    These hints and the fact that, unlike in other areas there are not historical
    subjects represented in the paintings, seems to indicate that Zimbabwean paintings
    are at least 1,000 years old. However, archaeological evidence (Walker 2012: 44)
    suggests that rock art could be significantly older than that, at least several

    Traditionally, the themes expressed in Zimbabwean rock art have been identified as the same as those of the San|Bushmen¹ from South Africa and in many cases are undoubtedly related, and provide key hints for their interpretation. However, there are also differences, such as the emphasis given to different animals, the higher presence of trees and plants in Zimbabwe or the smaller presence of trance scenes in the north compared to that of the Drakensberg. Moreover, the lack of ethnographic information for Zimbabwean paintings and their older chronology make it difficult to establish the same type of associations as those made for other areas with more direct connections rock art to known cultures, as happens in South Africa. Although in a minority, rock art of a later chronology can be attributed to Iron Age farmers, characterized by more schematic figures, usually white and painted thickly with the finger or the hand. As is the case in other areas in Central Africa, some of these later depictions are related to rain making and initiation ceremonies.

    ¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

    There seems to be a preference for the depiction of females rather than males,

    the depictions seem to have a deep symbolism far beyond the representation of
    animals just hunted and consumed, often being surrounded by dots, flecks or networks

  title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 3'
  body: The rock art of Zimbabwe is some of the richest in Africa both in variety
    and complexity, the vast majority being painted figures infilled or outlined usually
    with just one colour, although bichrome examples are also known. The human figure
    is the most often represented engaged in different activities -hunting, walking,
    dancing- either isolated or in groups of up to forty people. The figures are depicted
    in different styles, from the very schematic to relatively naturalistic outlines,
    with men far more represented than women, and usually depicted carrying bows and
    arrows. In some cases, these figures are part of very complex scenes including
    animals and geometric symbols, some of which have been interpreted as trance-like
    scenes similar to those in South Africa with figures bleeding from their noses,
    crouching or dancing in groups or sharing animal traits. A very specific type
    of depiction is human figures with hugely distended abdomens, a trait that is
    associated either with fertility or mystic potency concepts.

    visited southern Africa, but is especially linked to Leo Frobenius, one of the
    most renowned researchers in the first decades of the 20th century. Leo Frobenius
    travelled to the region in 1928 with a German team and thoroughly documented numerous
    paintings, identifying many of the most characteristic features of Zimbabwean
    rock art. However, he failed in identifying the authors of the paintings, ascribing
    them to external influences of “high civilizations” instead to the local communities
    who made them. Subsequently, work was continued by Elizabeth Mannsfeld-Goodall,
    who for forty years documented rock art paintings constituting a huge corpus of
    tracings, but without developing an interpretative framework for them. In the
    1950s, another historic researcher, the Abbé Henri Breuil, visited Zimbabwe and
    studied the paintings, again suggesting an Egyptian or Minoan origin. It wasn’t
    until the 1960s and 1970s when a more objective approach to the study of rock
    art started, with Peter Garlake the most prominent figure in research from the
    1980s onwards. Garlake wrote the first comprehensive books on Zimbabwean rock
    art (Garlake 1987), integrating it within the general framework of southern Africa
    and raising awareness about the importance of these archaeological expressions.
    In 2003 the Matobo Hills were included in the World Heritage List acknowledging
    the relevance of Zimbabwean rock art for African heritage. '

  body: "This idea was partly inspired by the testimony of Qing, a San|Bushman man
    who, in 1873, had guided the Colonial Administrator Joseph Millerd Orpen to rock
    art sites in the mountains of Lesotho, with which the Drakensberg forms a natural
    eastern border with South Africa and which also contains many rock paintings.
    Qing's explanations of the paintings, some of which Orpen copied, included a reference
    to antelope-headed human figures having “died and gone to live in rivers, who
    were spoilt at the same time as the elands and… by the dances of which you have
    seen paintings”. This, along with testimony and practices recorded from other
    South African San|Bushman people at the time, as well as those living elsewhere
    in south-western Africa in the 20th century, suggested to Lewis-Williams that
    these and other images in San|Bushman rock art may be a reference to the activities
    of spiritual leaders or 'shamans', people who, in San|Bushman communities, are
    believed to have the power to interact with spirits and the spirit world in ways
    which may affect the physical world. \n\nLewis-Williams and other proponents of
    this 'shamanistic' approach to interpreting San|Bushman rock art have proposed
    that much of its imagery is in fact related to the shaman's experience during
    the 'trance dance' ritual found in all San|Bushman socie-ties. During this activity
    the shaman enters a hallucinatory state in which spiritual ‘tasks’ such as healing
    the sick may be undertaken on behalf of the community. On entering the trance
    state the shaman experiences trembling, sweating, stumbling and other symptoms
    similar to those of a dying antelope hit by a poisoned arrow. Lewis Williams noted
    that among some San|Bushman people this process is referred to as ‘dying’ or being
    ‘spoilt’ and considered that the similarities between the eland and the therianthrope
    figure in this image represent this conceived equivalence.\n\n"

    Despite the historical presence of other large game animals in the Drakensberg, the eland is the most commonly depicted animal in rock art of the region. Patricia Vinnicombe, noting this and the focus on other particular subjects in the imagery at the expense of others, proposed in her pioneering 1976 study of the rock art of the Southern Drakensberg *People of the Eland* that the paintings are “not a realistic reflection of the daily pursuits or environment of the Bushmen” (Vinnicombe 1976:347). Vinnicombe recalled that when, in the 1930s, an old Sotho man named Mapote, who had San|Bushman half-siblings and had used to paint with them, was requested to demonstrate, he had said that since the San|Bushmen had been “of the eland”, he should first depict an eland. Based on this and recountings of a myth about the creation and death of the first eland from Qing and other contemporary Southern San|Bushman people, Vinnicombe concluded that the eland, although regularly hunted by the Drakensberg San|Bushmen, had been a particularly sacred or powerful animal to them and that “Through the act of painting and re-painting the eland… the mental conflict involved in destroying a creature that was prized and loved by their deity…was…ritually symbolised and resolved” (Vinnicombe, 1976:350).

    Building on the idea of the spiritual significance of the eland, the approach proposed by Lewis-Williams offered an alternative interpretation by inferring from ethnography that eland were believed to have spiritual ‘potency’. As part of a complex system of beliefs involving conceptions of power and potency in relation to animals and rites, this potency could be released upon death, with trancing shamans believed to be able to harness it, feeling themselves taking on the attributes of the animal. Thus therianthrope figures like those depicted here may be interpreted as representing hallucinatory experiences of shamans in trance, where they may feel that they are assuming the forms of other animals. It has been argued that other motifs such as geometric forms known as 'entoptics' represent the abstract patterns created by neural networks and ‘seen’ during the early stages of entering an altered state of consciousness and that the paintings themselves may have been created as reservoirs of spiritual potency.

    The rock art of South Africa has probably been studied more extensively than that of any other African country.  It is estimated that South Africa contains many thousands of rock art sites, with a great variety of styles and techniques.  The most well-known rock art in South Africa is that created by the San|Bushman¹ people (several culturally linked groups of indigenous people of southern Africa who were traditionally hunter-gatherers) and their ancestors, with the painted rock shelters of the Drakensberg mountains some of the most well-known rock art sites in the world.  However, the range of South African rock art is wide, spanning great distances, many centuries, and different cultural traditions.

    ¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

  body: South Africa covers around 1,213,090 km², encircling Lesotho and bordered
    in the north by Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe and in the west by Mozambique and
    Swaziland.  Much of the interior of the country consists of a high central plateau
    bordered by the Great Escarpment, a rocky ridge which forms the bulk of the long
    Drakensberg mountain system in the east and several smaller ranges in the centre
    and west of the country, as well as the western border with Lesotho.  Further
    to the south, the Cape Fold Mountains mirror the bend of the cape coast.  Much
    of South Africa’s known engraved rock art is found on igneous or metamorphic formations
    in the semi-arid environments of the central plateau.  In contrast, painted rock
    art sites are more commonly located in the sandstone and quartzite rock shelters
    of the mountain systems, which form the edges of the more temperate, low-lying
    coastal regions in the east and south of the country.

  body: Much of both the painted and engraved rock art of South Africa is characterised
    by its naturalistic depictions of animals, as well as numerous images of people,
    ambiguous figures with mixtures of animal and human features, and certain ‘geometric’
    or abstract shapes and patterns.  These images are the work of San|Bushman people
    and their ancestors.  Although San|Bushman communities now live mainly in Namibia,
    Botswana and north-western South Africa, historically San|Bushman cultural groups
    lived more widely throughout southern Africa.  Hunter-gatherer people are thought
    to have been the only inhabitants of what is now South Africa until the arrival

  title: Herder rock art and other traditions
  title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 5'
  body: Some rock art styles and motifs elsewhere in South Africa seem to belong to
    other unique traditions.  It has been proposed that engraved rock art patterns
    with particular features including circular, linear and oblong motifs found at
    sites across the country, particularly near watercourses, may be the work of the
    Khoekhoen people or their ancestors, herders culturally related to the San|Bushmen.
    Some paintings also appear to reflect this tradition. Local rock art traditions
    specific to certain areas include, among others, conglomerations of handprints
    near the coast in the south-western part of the Western Cape and rows of engraved
    cupules in the north east of the country. There are also several examples from
    different rock art traditions across South Africa, of depictions of European people,
    items or events (such as horses and firearms) which clearly date from the 17th
    century or later.  In the Karoo region, rock gongs (natural rock formations with
    indentations indicating that they have been used as percussive instruments) are
    sometimes associated with engraving sites.

    the expedition of  Ensign A. F. Beutler in 1752, describing paintings near the
    Great Fish River in the Eastern Cape.  Further written references to rock art
    from the area were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, with some of the
    earliest known reproductions of Southern African rock art made in the 1770s. During
    the 19th and early 20th centuries, painted copies were made of San|Bushman rock
    art by amateur artists such as George Stow, Mark and Graham Hutchinson and Helen

    execution and significance through a combination of quantitative study and reference
    to San|Bushman ethnography (written records of insights from San|Bushman culture
    compiled by anthropologists).  Through the 1980s, interpretation of rock art was
    further developed, perhaps most significantly by David Lewis-Williams, a collaborator
    of Vinnicombe's. Lewis-Williams originated an approach to understanding San|Bushman
    rock art which posits that the motivation and meaning for most, if not all, San|Bushman
    rock art is based on the centrality of the spiritual leader or'shaman' and the
    shaman’s actions in San|Bushman life and belief.  Over the past 30 years, the
    idea that much of San|Bushman rock art is essentially ‘shamanistic’ in nature
    has been dominant in academic discourse.

  title: Themes and interpretations
  title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 9'
  body: "Shamanistic interpretations of San|Bushman paintings and engravings draw
    on both past records of ‘Southern’ or /Xam San|Bushman people living historically
    in South Africa and more recent ethnography based mainly on San|Bushman communities
    in Namibia and Botswana, suggesting that their imagery illustrated and reinforced
    the power of the actions of shamans. Much of the imagery is proposed to reflect
    the shaman’s hallucinatory visions from the 'trance dance’, a tradition common
    to San|Bushman groups where shamans enter a trance state during which they visit
    a 'spirit world' in which they may go on spiritual journeys or perform tasks on
    behalf of their communities. It is thought that the rock art panels may have acted
    as reservoirs for the 'potency' that shamans are considered to possess, with the
    rock face considered a veil between both worlds.  The images are thought to reflect
    trance experiences including those of 'therianthropes’, images of figures with
    both human and animal features, explained as shamans who in a trance state feel
    themselves transformed into animals.  Certain other poses and features found in
    San|Bushman rock art, such as so-called 'entoptic' motifs—geometric shapes such
    as zigzags and dots—have also been interpreted as reflecting visions that shamans
    experience while in a trance state.  \n\nDiscussion continues around the extent
    of the applicability of 'shamanist' interpretations for all aspects of San|Bushman
    art, with research ongoing and scholars also exploring the potential roles of
    other elements in rock art production, such as mythology or gender and initiation
    rites.  Other avenues of study include more regional foci, on specific cultural
    and temporal contexts and how the imagery may reflect local power dynamics through
    time.\n"

    from central African geometric traditions and tracing historical migrations southwards.  It
    has also been suggested that some finger-painted images in the centre of the country

  title: Chronology
  title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 11'
  body: "The earliest scientifically dated examples of clearly visible painted parietal
    art in South Africa comes from Steenbokfontein Cave in the Western Cape, where
    collapsed painted portions from the wall buried in sediment have been radiocarbon
    dated to at least 3,600 years ago, while in the Drakensberg, AMS dating carried
    out on the oxalate crust superimposing a painting of a human figure has suggested
    it to be at least 1,800 years old.  While it is thought that the beginnings of
    the painting tradition in the Drakensberg region are probably older than this,
    the relative lack of durability in paint means that many of the existing paintings
    were probably made sometime within the past few hundred years. Sometimes it is
    apparent when this is the case - several painting sites in this region show images
    of both San|Bushman people and Europeans riding horses and bearing firearms, which
    dates them to within the past 350 years and particularly the 19th century.  Images
    of sheep and cattle also place images within the last 2,000 years.  \n\nThe oldest
    reliably dated evidence for deliberate engraving in the country is several ochre
    pieces incised with abstract patterns found in a buried layer in Blombos cave
    in the Western Cape and dated through a number of methods to between 70 and 100,000
    years ago.  The earliest known figurative engraving date from the country comes
    from a slab with an image of a portion of an animal on it, excavated from Wonderwerk
    Cave in the Northern Cape and dating from around 10,200 years ago.  Engravings
    remaining in the open are more difficult to date scientifically, and various attempts
    have been made to date and sequence both engravings and paintings based on style
    and superimposition, while recent years, work has been undertaken to apply the
    Harris Matrix (an archaeological sequencing technique for relative dating) method
    to painting chronologies in the Free State, Drakensberg and Western Cape.  This
    involves using techniques originally conceived for charting chronology in stratigraphic
    layering to compare and sequence different superimposed motifs.\n"

    The southern African countries of Zimbabwe, South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, Botswana and Namibia contain thousands of rock art sites and southern African rock art has been studied extensively.  Due to perceived similarities in subject matter, even across great distances, much southern African rock art has been ascribed to hunter-gatherer painters and engravers who appear to have had a shared set of cultural references.  These have been linked with beliefs and practices which remain common to modern San|Bushman¹ people, a number of traditional hunter-gatherer groups who continue to live in Southern Africa, principally in Namibia, Botswana and South Africa.  There are, however, differences in style and technique between regions, and various rock art traditions are attributed to other cultural groups and their ancestors.  As is often the case with rock art, the accurate attribution of authorship, date and motivation is difficult to establish, but the rock art of this region continues to be studied and the richness of the material in terms of subject matter, as well as in the context of the archaeological record, has much to tell us, both about its own provenance and the lives of the people who produced it.

  title: Types of rock art
  title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 4'
  body: "Rock art of the type associated with hunter-gatherers is perhaps the most
    widely distributed rock art tradition in southern Africa, with numerous known
    examples in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe, but also with examples found in
    Botswana and Mozambique. This tradition comprises paintings and engravings, with
    both techniques featuring images of animals and people.  The type and composition
    varies from region to region.  For example, rock art sites of the southern Drakensberg
    and Maloti mountains in South Africa and Lesotho contain a higher proportion of
    images of eland antelope, while those in Namibia in turn feature more giraffes.
    \ There are also regional variations in style and colour: in some sites and areas
    paintings are polychrome (multi-coloured) while in others they are not.\n\nDifferences
    also occur in composition between painting and engraving sites, with paintings
    more likely to feature multiple images on a single surface, often interacting
    with one another, while engraving sites more often include isolated images on
    individual rocks and boulders.  However, there are commonalities in both imagery
    and style, with paintings throughout southern Africa often including depictions
    of people, particularly in procession and carrying items such as bows and arrows.
    \ Also heavily featured in both paintings and engravings are animals, in particular
    large ungulates which are often naturalistically depicted, sometimes in great
    detail.  Additionally, images may include people and animals which appear to have
    the features of several species and are harder to identify.  Some hunter-gatherer
    type paintings are described as ‘fine-line’ paintings because of the delicacy
    of their rendering with a thin brush.  \n"

    Brandberg and Erongo Mountains in Namibia and the Matobo Hills in Zimbabwe, while
    engraving sites are found throughout the interior, often near water courses. \n\nA
    different form of rock painting from the hunter-gatherer type, found mainly in
    the north-eastern portion of southern Africa is that of the ‘late whites’.  Paintings
    in this tradition are so-called because they are usually associated with Bantu
    language-speaking Iron Age farming communities who entered the area from the north
    from around 2,000 years ago and many of these images are thought to have been
    painted later than some of the older hunter-gatherer paintings. ‘Late white’ paintings
    take many forms, but have generally been applied with a finger rather than a brush,
    and as the name suggests, are largely white in colour.  These images represent
    animals, people and geometric shapes, often in quite schematic forms, in contrast
    to the generally more naturalistic depictions of the hunter-gatherer art.  \n\nSometimes
    ‘late white’ art images relate to dateable events or depict objects and scenes
    which could only have taken place following European settlement, such as trains.
    \ Other forms of southern African rock art also depict European people and objects.
    \ These include images from the Western Cape in South Africa of a sailing ship,
    estimated to date from after the mid-17th century, as well as painted and engraved
    imagery from throughout South Africa showing people on horseback with firearms.

    that they follow the period of first contact between European and indigenous people.

    in the art was piqued by a series of illustrated publications. The hunter-gatherer
    rock art in particular had a strong aesthetic and academic appeal to western audiences,
    and reports, photographs and copied images attracted the attention of prominent
    figures in archaeology and ethnology such as Miles Burkitt, Leo Frobenius and

  title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 7'
  body: Rather than showing scenes from daily life, as was once assumed, it is now
    usually accepted that hunter-gatherer art in southern Africa shows images and
    motifs of spiritual and cultural importance. In particular, it is thought that
    some images reflect trance visions of San|Bushman spiritual leaders, or shamans,  during
    which they are considered to enter the world of spirits, where they are held to
    perform tasks for themselves and their communities, such as healing the sick or
    encouraging rain. This interpretation, which has been widely accepted, explains
    certain features of the art, for example the predominance of certain animals like
    eland antelope (due to their special cultural significance) and themes such as
    dot patterns and zigzag lines (interpreted as geometric patterns that shamans
    may see upon entering a trance state).

  body: "The rock art attributed to ancestral San|Bushman hunter-gatherers has many
    varied motifs, some of which may also relate to specific themes such as initiation
    or rainmaking (indeed within its cultural context one image may have several significances).
    \ San|Bushman informants in the 19th century told researchers that certain ambiguously
    shaped animals in the rock art repertoire represented animals related to water.
    \ Images such as these are known to researchers as 'rain animals' and it has been
    suggested that certain images could reflect—or prompt—the shaman's attempt to
    control rainfall. Some 'late white' art has also been proposed to have associations
    with rainmaking practices, and indeed the proximity of some geometric rock art
    images, proposed to be of possible Khoekhoen origin, to watercourses appears to
    emphasise the practical and spiritual significance of water among historical southern
    African communities. It has also been proposed that some forms of geometric art
    attributed to Khoekhoen people may be linked by tradition and motif to the schematic
    art traditions of central Africa, themselves attributed to hunter-gatherers and
    possibly made in connection with beliefs about water and fertility.  Much in the
    “late white” corpus of paintings appears to be connected to initiation practices,
    part of a larger set of connected traditions extending north as far as Kenya.
    \  \n\nThe long time periods, cultural connections, and movements involved can
    make attribution difficult.  For example, the idiosyncratic rock paintings of
    Tsodilo Hills in Botswana which appear to have similarities with the hunter-gatherer
    style include images of domesticates and may have been the work of herders.  More
    localised traditions, such as that of engravings in north-western South Africa
    representing the homesteads of ancestral Nguni or Sotho-Tswana language speakers,
    or the focus on engravings of animal tracks found in Namibia, demonstrate more
    specific regional significances.  Research continues and in recent decades, researchers,
    focusing on studying individual sites and sets of sites within the landscape and
    the local historical context, have discussed how their placement and subject matter
    may reflect the shifting balances of power, and changes in their communities over
    time.  \n"

  title: Dating
  title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 9'
  body: "Although dating rock art is always difficult, the study of rock art sites
    from southern Africa has benefitted from archaeological study and excavations
    at rock art sites have sometimes revealed useful information for ascribing dates.
    \ Some of the oldest reliably dated examples of rock art in the world have been
    found in the region, with the most well-known examples probably being the painted
    plaques from Apollo 11 Cave in Namibia, dated to around 30,000 years ago.  A portion
    of an engraved animal found in South Africa’s Northern Cape is estimated to be
    10,200 years old and painted spalls from shelter walls in Zimbabwe have been dated
    to 12,000 years ago or older.  However, it is thought that the majority of existing
    rock art was made more recently.  As ever, subject matter is also helpful in ascribing
    maximum date ranges.  We know, for example,that images of domestic animals are
    probably less than 2,000 years old.  The condition of the art may also help to
    establish relative ages, particularly with regards to engravings, which may be
    in some cases be categorised by the discolouration of the patina that darkens
    them over time.   \n\nThe multiplicity of rock art sites throughout southern Africa
    form a major component of southern Africa’s archaeological record, with many interesting
    clues about the lives of past inhabitants and, in some cases, continuing religious
    and cultural importance for contemporary communities.  Many sites are open to
    the public, affording visitors the unique experience of viewing rock art in situ.
    \ Unfortunately, the exposed nature of rock art in the field leaves it open to
    potential damage from the environment and vandalism.  Many  major rock art sites
    in southern Africa are protected by law in their respective countries and the
    Maloti-Drakensberg Park in South Africa and Lesotho, Twyfelfontein/ǀUi-ǁAis in

  body: "Rock art is found across the country from the southern border almost to the
    northern border, although rock art sites are scarce in the far north.  The majority
    of known rock art sites are found in the rocky and mountainous areas forming the
    escarpment edge in the west of the country.  Particular concentrations of rock
    art are found in the west-centre of the country, north of the edge of the Namib’s
    coastal sand sea.  Namibia’s most well-known rock art locales are clustered in
    this area, among them the Brandberg (also known as Dâures) and Erongo mountains
    and the Spitzkoppe peaks, as well as the well-known engraved rock art complex
    at  Twyfelfontein | /Ui-//aes.  \n\nAround  20km wide, the almost circular granitic
    intrusion of the Brandberg contains Namibia’s highest point  at over 2,500 ft.,
    and around 1,000 rock art sites, with around 50,000 individual figures recorded.
    These include both paintings and engravings but paintings form the majority. The
    Erongo mountains, a similar but less compact formation around 120km to the south-east,
    contain a further 80 sites and 50km to the west of this, the Spitzkoppe peaks,
    a group of granite inselbergs, has a smaller concentration of known sites with
    37 so far recorded.  Painting sites are most often found on vertical surfaces
    in rock shelters or the sides of granitic boulders,  while engravings may survive
    in more exposed environments such as on boulders, often dolerite or sandstone.
    \  \n\nThe most well-known of the engraving sites is that of Twyfelfontein | /Ui-//aes,
    around 50 km north of the Brandberg. The rock art complex here is dominated by
    collections of engraved images, though some paintings are also present.  With
    well over 2,000 individual images, the Twyfelfontein engravings form the largest
    known discrete collection of engraved rock art in Southern Africa.   \n"

  title: History of research
  title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 5'
  body: 'The first published mention of rock art in south-western Africa may be that
    of C. J. Andersson who mentioned “A strange tale of a rock in which the tracks
    of …animals are distinctly visible” in his 1856 book Lake Ngami.  Further reports
    came in the 1870s when the Reverend C. J. Büttner published an article in a South
    African periodical reporting rock art in the Erongo Mountains, while Commissioner
    William Coates Palgrave made a report of paintings near Dassiesfontein, along
    with some the earliest known photographs of rock art in Africa.  European public
    awareness of rock art from the region in Europe was spurred by the January 1910
    publication of an article  by Oberleutnant Hugo Jochmann featuring images from
    various sites in a German magazine.  The  first monograph on the rock art of the
    area then known as South West Africa was published in 1930 (Obermaier & Kühn,
    1930), following further reports by officials, including the explorer and geographer
    Reinhardt Maack, who in a 1921 report first noted the existence of engravings
    at Twyfelfontein.  '

  title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 6'
  body: "During the course of an earlier expedition, Maack had stumbled upon a singular
    painting in a Brandberg rock shelter. This image came to be well-known as the
    ‘White Lady’ of the Brandberg, after the renowned rock art researcher the Abbé
    Henri Breuil, who saw Maack’s copy of it and took a keen interest in the image.
    Eventually Breuil published a lavishly illustrated volume on the White Lady in
    1955, which made it one of the most famous rock painting images in the world.
    \ During the 1940s and 50s Breuil also explored and published on rock art sites
    elsewhere in the Brandberg and Erongo mountains.  \n\nErnst Scherz, who had acted
    as a guide for Breuil, would go on to conduct extensive documentation work throughout
    the country as part of  the comprehensive research project investigating the archaeology
    of South West Africa run by the University of Cologne and sponsored by the Deutschen
    Forschungsgemeinschaft.  Beginning in 1963, this resulted in the publications
    of Scherz’s three-volume opus *Felsbilder in Sudwest-Afrika* in 1970, 1975 and
    1986, containing site by site descriptions and classifications of painting and
    engraving sites throughout modern Namibia, along with discussion of theme and
    context.  The Cologne programme also supported the work of several other researchers,
    including the designer and artist Harald Pager, whose meticulous work recording
    rock paintings in South Africa’s Drakensberg had already gained him recognition
    in the field of rock art research. From 1977, Pager began a seven year project
    of recording painted rock art sites in the Brandberg, documenting around 43,000
    individual images.  Pager’s corpus has been organised by Tilman Lenssen-Erz and
    published posthumously in the six-volume   *Rock Paintings of the Upper Brandberg*,
    as a result of which the Brandberg is one of the most comprehensively documented
    rock art regions on earth.\n"

  title: Themes
  title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 8'
  body: "Much of the painted rock art in Namibia may be broadly compared to the wider
    hunter-gatherer rock art oeuvre found throughout southern Africa, similar in theme
    and composition and believed to be a part of the same general tradition, which
    is generally attributed to San|Bushman¹ people and their ancestors.  Imagery includes
    scenes of human figures carrying bows and other implements, wild animals and unidentified
    shapes in different pigments.  Overall, human figures dominate in the paintings
    of Namibia, making up more than 2/3 of the painted figures, and where the gender
    can be recognised, they are more commonly male than female.  Prominent painting
    subjects and styles in the rock art of Namibia (particularly the best-studied
    west-central region) include, at some sites, clearly delineated dots and patterns
    on human figures, a particular tradition of showing human figures with voluminous
    decorated hairstyles, and more images of giraffe and kudu, gemsbok and springbok
    antelope than in other southern African regions.  Other images of animals include
    those of zebras, elephants, rhinoceros and ostriches.  More occasional motifs
    found include plants, cattle, sheep and handprints. \n\n¹ San|Bushmen is a collective
    term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living
    in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions. Both 'San'
    and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups,
    although others have positively adopted them."

  body: "Within Namibia, paintings come in a variety of styles, ranging from naturalistic
    to stylised.  Paintings found at Spitzkoppe tend to be smaller and cruder than
    others in the region, where some sites feature tableaux in many colours while
    others are entirely monochrome.   While the majority of rock  paintings in Namibia
    seem to conform to the hunter-gatherer style, there are also some examples of
    finger paintings in the Brandberg and northern Namibia, which are much more schematic
    in style and appear to belong to a different tradition altogether.  \n\nAs with
    much southern African rock art, the colours visible today may not always accurately
    reflect the original look as some pigments.  This is particularly true for those
    used for pale colours or white, which may be ‘fugitive’, meaning that over time
    they fade or wash away faster than the more stable pigments around them, leaving
    gaps which were once coloured.  Chemical analyses have shown that a major binder
    (used to coalesce dry pigment powder) for painted rock art in Namibia was blood,
    and in some cases egg white.   \n"

    figures.  There is also less obvious interaction between individual engraved figures
    in the form of ‘scenes’ than in paintings, but instead more isolated individuals
    scattered on rock surfaces. Engraved rock art in Namibia also features a particular
    preponderance of  images of spoor (animal hoof or paw prints).  Some of these
    engravings are very naturalistic and may be identified by species whereas others,
    such as some showing human footprints, can be quite schematic.  In addition, many
    engravings are geometric in nature.   '

  title: Interpretation
  title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 11'
  body: "Namibian rock paintings, and most engravings, have largely been interpreted
    in the vein largely espoused by  researchers over the past 30 years.  This postulates
    that much of this rock art reflects the experience of San|Bushman shamans entering
    trance states and that rather than being scenes from daily life, the depictions
    of animals and activities are highly symbolic within San|Bushman cosmology, with
    images acting as reservoirs of spiritual power.  This avenue of interpretation
    originates largely from the study of rock art in South Africa and Lesotho.  While
    it appears broadly applicable here, the fact that direct attributions to known
    cultural groups in this area are difficult somewhat hinders direct comparisons
    with Namibian rock art.  While hunter-gatherer rock painting production in South
    Africa was practiced until the recent past, it appears to have ceased in Namibia
    around a thousand  years ago and modern San|Bushman groups in the Kalahari area
    have no tradition of rock art production.   \n\nAdditionally, hundreds of miles
    and different geographical environments separate the rock art centres of north-western
    Namibia from those in neighbouring countries. This is particularly apparent in
    the differences in terms of animal subject matter, with the numerous depictions
    of gemsbok and springbok, explicable by the rock art creators being semi-desert
    dwellers where gemsbok and springbok are found locally though largely absent from
    rock art elsewhere in southern Africa, where these animals are not found. \n"

  body: "Other differences are found in style and emphasis: the frequency with which
    giraffe feature in Namibian paintings and engravings contrasts with the South
    African rock art, where the emphasis is more on the eland antelope.  This has
    led some to propose that the giraffe, similarly, must have held a particular symbolic
    meaning for the painters of the region.  Based on associated imagery, placement
    of the rock art sites, and some ethnography (written records of insights from
    contemporary San|Bushman culture compiled by anthropologists) it has been suggested
    that giraffes may have been linked with rain in local belief systems, with some
    Namibian rock painting sites are associated specifically with rainmaking or healing
    activities. \n\nWhile the more naturalistic examples of engravings are thought
    to have also been produced by ancient hunter-gatherers, as with the paintings,
    it has been suggested that some geometric engravings were produced  by herding
    people, possibly ancestral Khoenkhoen, perhaps in relation to initiation rites.
    \ Schematic finger paintings have also been attributed to pastoralist people.
    \ All attributions are tentative, however, because the majority of the art is
    thought to be many hundreds of years old and the historical distinctions between
    hunter-gatherers and herders is by no means clear-cut in the archaeological record.\n"

    moon mission which took place during the period of the excavation work) are not
    thought to have fallen from a cave wall but were made on loose rock pieces.  The
    only parietal art (on a fixed rock surface) dated from excavated deposits in Namiba
    so far consists of pieces of painted granite from the largest painted shelter
    in the Brandberg, one of which, found in a sedimentary layer radiocarbon dated
    to around 2,700 years ago, had clearly fallen from an exposed rock surface into
    which researchers were able to refit it. Aside from this, estimates at the age
    of rock art are based on superimposition, patination and associated archaeological
    finds. \n\nBased on archaeological evidence, it is thought that the majority of
    the fine-line hunter-gatherer rock art in the Brandberg area was produced between
    around 4,000 and 2,000 years ago, with the painting tradition in the wider region
    starting as much as 6,000 years ago. This ceased sometime after the introduction
    of small domestic stock to the area, although not immediately, as fine-line paintings
    of sheep and paintings and engravings of cattle testify.   Across central Namibia,
    there appears to be a particularly strong correspondence of finds relating to
    paintings—such as grinding equipment and pigments—with dated layers from the 1st
    millennium BC.\n"

  body: 'Engravings are more difficult to obtain dates for scientifically. Superimpositioning
    and other physical factors can serve to indicate which styles of image are more
    recent with both paintings and engravings. For example, in the Brandberg, monochrome
    tableaux appear older than detailed polychrome depictions of individuals, and
    certain images, such as those of zebras, are thought to be relatively late.  Among
    engravings of central Namibia, a certain style of hoof print appears to overlie
    some figurative images, leading researchers to believe them younger.  Overall
    it is thought that the engraving and painting traditions were concurrent, with
    some clear parallels in style, but that engraving probably lasted for several
    hundred years as a tradition after painting ceased.  '

    images in southern Africa.  Covering about 57 hectares in the core area and home
    to over 2,000 engravings, the rock art sites are situated near a small but permanent
    spring. The site was first formally noted by Reinhard Maack in a 1921 report to
    the Administrator of South West Africa, following a report to him from a surveyor
    named Volkmann mentioning the engravings, near a spring Volkmann named as Uais
    (/Ui-//aes= place among rocks or jumping waterhole in Khoekhoegowab, the language
    of the local Damara people).  Later, the land came into the use of farmer David
    Levin, whose concern over the survival of the spring led ultimately to its being
    referred to as Twyfelfontein (‘doubtful spring’ in Afrikaans). In 1963 Ernst Scherz

  body: The engravings are found in several loose conglomerations, on sandstone surfaces
    at the base of a hill scarp within the basin of the ephemeral Huab River, while
    the few painted panels in the area are found on the underside of sandstone rock
    overhangs.  The engraved images are pecked and/or ground/polished and are made
    in a variety of styles, with ubiquitous geometric patterns of cross-hatched, looped
    and linear forms, as well as circles and polished depressions and cupules.  In
    addition there are numerous depictions of animals, ranging in style from more
    naturalistic to stylised and distorted.  Chief among the animal images is the
    giraffe, which is most numerous.  Also common are images of rhinoceroses, zebra,
    gemsbok antelope and ostriches.  There are occasional depictions of cattle but
    images of human beings are almost absent.  Also featured are images of human footprints
    and animal spoor (hoof and paw prints).

  body: The figurative images in the engraved art feature several different distinct
    styles, ranging from very naturalistic outlines of animals such as giraffes and
    rhinoceroses, through carefully delineated but stylised or distorted renditions
    of these animals with exaggerated extremities, to very schematic pecked outlines.  One
    particular aspect of style is a form of relief engraving, whereby in some deeply
    pecked figures' muscle masses are delineated.  In others, the infill pecking is
    graded and  sparser in the centre of a figure, giving the impression of shading.  A
    few of the engravings are highly polished.  Perhaps most renowned among these
    is the “dancing kudu” image, a stylised image of a kudu antelope cow rendered
    atop a flat slab of rock and surrounded by geometric shapes.

  body: "It appears that the kudu figure is pregnant and it has been suggested that
    the choice of this animal may have been made in relation to female initiation
    practices. This is because the female kudu has a symbolic importance relating
    to women’s behaviour in the cosmology of some San|Bushman¹ people, traditionally
    hunter-gatherer people whose ancestors are thought to have made most of southern
    Africa’s rock paintings and engravings.  Other animals known to have symbolic
    and metaphorical significance to San|Bushman people are also depicted here (giraffe
    images are most numerous) and these images have been interpreted in the vein of
    other southern African rock art sites, where images are thought to reflect the
    experiences of shamans while in a trance state, and may have multiple metaphorical
    and other cultural meanings.  \n\nThe engravings were certainly made in strategic
    locations and not simply on any available rock surface, with some images having
    been deliberately made in places that are difficult to reach and to see.  The
    reason for this is unclear, though it has been suggested that such placement might
    be in relation to the images serving a preparatory function for shamans preparing
    to enter a trance.  Some of the engravings have exaggerated features such as elongated
    limbs and extremities which may reflect trance experience.  One of the engravings
    appears to depict a lion with pugmarks (paw prints) instead of feet and third
    at the end of the tail.  Each of those in the feet have five instead of the correct
    four pads and this has been interpreted as meaning that the figure represents
    a human shaman in trance who has taken on lion form.  A similar suggestion has
    been made regarding the frequent depictions of ostriches (Kinahan, 2006).  \n\n¹
    San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher
    groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.
    Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these
    groups, although others have positively adopted them.\n"

  body: "Such interpretations are made on the basis that the artists followed the
    same cultural tradition as the ancestral San|Bushman. The few examples of painted
    rock art at the site certainly appear to conform to the hunter-gatherer tradition
    found elsewhere in Namibia.   Following this approach, the geometric engraved
    forms may be interpreted as illustrative of so-called ‘entoptic’ phenomena: shapes
    and patterns observed when entering a trance state, though an alternative origin
    for some of the geometrics with particular line and circle motifs has also been
    suggested. This proposal suggests that they were made by ancestral Khoenkhoen
    herder people, rather than hunter-gatherers, perhaps in relation to initiation
    practices.  \n\nAttempting to date or sequence the images based on superimpositioning
    or patina is difficult – superimposition of engravings at the site is rare and
    a range of patination colours seem to indicate these works having been created
    over a wide timescale, though it has been noted that a certain style of spoor
    images sometimes overlie some of the animal figures, indicating that this is a
    younger tradition.  Archaeological fieldwork around the site undertaken in 1968
    by Erich Wendt recovered evidence of occupation including stone tools, worked
    ostrich eggshell and stone structures.  The dates recovered from radiocarbon dating
    ranged widely from c.5,850-180 BP (years before present).  The relationship between
    periods of occupation/site use and the production of rock art is not known, but
    based on archaeological evidence from around the wider area it is thought that
    engravings in the styles found at Twyfelfontein range from around 6,000 to around
    1,000 years old, though some may be more recent.\n"

    Using innovative digital technology and photogrammetry in combination with our extensive archival photographic collections, we started experimenting with making [3D models](https://sketchfab.com/britishmuseum/collections/african-rock-art) of rock art solely using 20-year-old digitised, archival photographs of the rock art sites.  Building on this work, we realised it would be possible to use these techniques to further contextualize rock art sites in their landscape environment, combining archival images and records with satellite imagery and 360° images of a site -- a technique which proves hugely important for possible reconstructions of heritage sites largely using historical photos!

    Working closely in collaboration with the African Conservation Trust (ACT) ([http://www.projectafrica.com/](http://www.projectafrica.com/)), our colleagues in South Africa, and Soluis ([http://www.soluis.com/heritage/](http://www.soluis.com/heritage/)), our technology partner, we were able to develop the Rock Art VR mobile app by combining our archival photography with additional 360° imagery and mapping of the site of Game Pass Shelter provided by ACT. Rather than simply using modern 3D scanning and regular VR methods, Soluis developed innovative solutions in order to combine the archival imagery, 360° photos, and satellite videos to create an immersive VR tour of Game Pass Shelter that would be still be accessible on widely-available smartphone technology and simple cardboard headsets. By using widely-available mobile technology, it will be possible for ACT and our other project partners in Africa to easily use the app for education and outreach purposes, in particular at rock art centres (Kamberg, Didima, and KZM museum) in South Africa where local custodians teach school children about rock art and its importance.

    in southern Namibia, modern humans painted images of animals, including rhinoceros,
    onto plaques of stone. A couple of thousand years earlier, in the cold, harsh
    tundra-like conditions of the Ardèche in south-central France, modern humans were
    also painting images of rhinoceros onto cave walls. The oldest scientifically
    dated rock art in Africa and Europe may be 8000 km apart but coincide both temporally
    and in subject matter. One of the oldest images that humans selected to depict
    was the formidable rhinoceros. The choice of subject matter in rock art depictions
    was not simply based on the presence or abundance of a particular species; rather
    they were conveying messages about the significance of an animal.

    In both species, a layer of fat sits between the hide and the flesh of the animal and in the white rhinoceros this can be up to or exceed a thickness of 50mm. It is well known that San|Bushmen believed the fat around the heart of the eland contained high levels of supernatural potency, and like the eland, they believed the rhinoceros to be especially potent animals (Ouzman, 1996:45)

    Rhinoceros in rock art imagery are both painted and engraved, but the prevalence of engraved images in southern African rock art is pronounced. Rhinoceros are well represented, even dominant, at numerous engraving sites in the Free State, Gauteng, Northern Cape and North West provinces of South Africa and at numerous Namibian sites (Ouzman, 1996:42)

    to have been influenced by shamanism (Ouzman, 1996:36). Both painted and engraved
    images share certain distinctive traits which suggest that both art forms were
    the result of a single belief system. These shared features include: a selected
    range of animals, unusual body postures in human figures, complex ‘scenes’ and
    non-realistic features on both animals and humans such as the addition or absence
    of limbs, conflation of human and animal morphology and exaggerated attributes
    (Ouzman, 1996:36) These features are critical to our understanding of the images
    as they are inextricably tied in to San|Bushman belief systems.\n\nThere are very
    few references to rhinoceros in San|Bushman ethnography. However, what does exist
    indicates that rhinoceros were of supernatural importance to certain groups of
    San|Bushmen (Ouzman, 1996:42). One particular site named Thaba Sione in South
    Africa, is primarily known for its numerous engravings of rhinoceros and may have
    been chosen as an engraving site because rhinoceros were known to have frequented
    the site. \n\nThaba Sione (Zion’s Hill) a low hill of less than nine metres in
    height is an important archaeological and rock art site in the North West province.
    It is scattered with more than 450 engraved dolerite boulders with the seasonal
    Thlakajeng River running 350 metres south-west containing numerous waterholes.
    The hill is bounded by 27 standing stones that have been rubbed smooth by rhinoceros
    after wallowing in the muddy waterholes of the river (Ouzman, 1996:40). Interestingly,
    one third of all the stones that he been rubbed by rhinoceros are also engraved
    (Lewis-Williams & Blundell, 1998:111).\n"

  body: "Dating rock engravings is always problematic, and the imagery at Thaba Sione
    has been estimated to fall within a broad estimate of between 1,200 - 10,000 years
    old (Ouzman, 1995:55). Rock art of the last 2,000 years correlates with a number
    of different cultural groups such as farmers, pastoralists, hunter-gatherers etc.
    However, the rock art at Thaba Sione is attributed to San|Bushmen and widely understood
    to reflect a shamanic belief system. Situated close to a waterhole it has been
    proposed that Thaba Sione was selected specifically by the San|Bushmen for rain-making
    beliefs and practices, but appears to have been modified as a result of Bantu-speaking
    farmers moving into the area from around 1500 years ago.\n\nIt is thought that
    the population of Thaba Sione were similar in social, economic and cultural terms
    to the now extinct |Xam, a cultural group who inhabited the central interior of
    South Africa and for whom we have extensive ethnographic accounts. Additionally,
    they are likely to have been similarly comparable to the !Kung and Ju|’hoan, contemporary
    cultural groups who live to the north of Thaba Sione in Botswana and Namibia.
    A comparison of rock art imagery at Thaba Sione and the ethnographic accounts
    of the |Xam and !Kung show strong similarities in belief systems pertaining to
    shamanism (Ouzman, 1996:39).\n\nThaba Sione has been a primary focus for archaeologists
    as there are [559 identified engraved images ](http://bit.ly/2pLfwp4)located on
    or close to the hill site showing a wide variety of depictions. Images include
    baboon, birds, buffalo, eland, elephant, felines, giraffe, human figures, lizard,
    ostrich, rhinoceros, warthog and zebra (Ouzman, 1996:41). "

    (62 or 11.1%), after human figures (72 or 12.9%) (Ouzman, 1996:43). Of the 62
    engravings, around 65% have been identified as white rhinoceros, based on the
    animals’ pronounced nuchal hump (the hump on the dorsal part of the neck), its
    large front horn and its square lip. The remaining 35% are of the smaller black
    rhino based on the hook lip that hangs from its upper jaw and its smaller nuchal
    hump. Historically, both species of rhinoceros were widespread in the area around
    Thaba Sione (Ouzman, 1996:45).

  body: "Rhinoceros show more ‘non-real’ features, combinations and variations in
    engraving techniques and occur in more complex ‘scenes’ than any other category
    of image at the site.\n\nFive of the engravings of rhinoceros are notable by the
    presence of ‘non-realistic’ features. Although the number of rhinoceros with these
    attributes is very small in comparison to the overall number of images of rhinoceros,
    it has been proposed that the placement and number of these features outweigh
    those found on other images. Such features are thought to convey information which
    related to three aspects of San shamanism, namely “shamanic transformation, gender
    relations and rain-making” (Ouzman, 1996:42).\n\nOne of these five images shows
    a part-human and part-rhinoceros figure. The posture of this therianthropic figure
    has its hand to its nose. When shamans are performing their medicine dance, they
    sometimes experience bleeding from the nose both before and after they enter a
    trance-like state. This posture combined with other features such as two rhinoceros-like
    horns, a short, thick, rhino-like tail, one back leg akin to that of a rhinoceros
    and the other back leg terminating in a human foot, as well as a fat pendulous
    body has been proposed to be a “shaman in a trance who has assumed, in part, rhinoceros
    form and potency” (Ouzman, 1996:46).\n\nAnother engraving shows the horns of two
    black rhinoceros which have been deliberately elongated and truncated respectively
    in order to project towards a fissure in the rock face. It has been argued that
    cracks or fissures in the rock face were seen as entry and exit points to the
    spirit world and the rock face acted as veil between these two worlds. These two
    horns are thus not real but are closely associated with the spirit world which
    the rhinoceros are entering, leaving or even guarding (Ouzman, 1996:49). \n"

    However, in real life female rhinoceros sometimes have a third horn as a deformity
    and this engraving possibly attempts to emphasise the role of the female shaman
    as a potent guardian and protector. Yet the message is unclear since, as black
    rhinoceros are known for their anti-social, unpredictable and violent behaviour
    it is uncertain whether engraved rhinoceros with “nuanced horns” are indicative
    of feminine or masculine gender and power relations, possibly containing elements
    of both. The shaman was a person who moved between the real and the non-real world,
    and is characterised by ambiguity and tension, so maintaining an indistinct gender
    identity in this context conforms to what we know of shamanic practices and representations

  body: "San|Bushman shamans were also inextricably linked with rain-making ceremonies.
    The ritual involved the whole of the community but it was the shaman, while in
    a trance-like state, that captured the rain in a perceived animal-like state.
    The rain animal was either seen as an ill-tempered ‘rain-bull’, characterised
    by thunder and lightning and harmful to life, or as a more pleasant ‘rain-cow’,
    which provided the temperate rains that renewed the grassland (Ouzman, 1996:51)
    Rain animals were not seen as a distinct species of animal, but were depicted
    with large bodies and were often horned; one of the few ethnographic accounts
    that refer to rhinoceros implicate them in rain-making (Ouzman, 1996:52).  \n\nIn
    some contexts certain physical and behavioural characteristics of rhinoceros may
    have been perceived by some San|Bushman as closely paralleling the perceived appearance
    and behaviour of a rain animal. These features include its fat and horns, its
    association with water and its nocturnal habits (in San|Bushman accounts of rain-making,
    shamans capture the rain animals at night). If rhinoceros were associated with
    rain animals, the more gregarious white rhinoceros might have been equated with
    the rain-cow while the ill-tempered black rhinoceros with the angry rain-bull
    (Ouzman, 1996:54).\n\nAt further sites in the Free State province of South Africa
    and the Erongo Mountains of Namibia, painted therianthropic figures (part-human,
    part-rhinoceros) depicting unusual body postures reminiscent of the *Great Trance
    Dance* and non-realistic features such as exaggerated horn size also seem draw
    on the rhinoceros as an animal of potency (Hollmann and Lewis-Williams, 2006).
    Furthermore, a golden rhinoceros from the Iron Age site of Mapungubwe in northern
    South Africa is testament to the status in which these animals were held, not
    only by San/Bushmen, but by other cultural groups in southern Africa. Thriving
    between 1220-1300 AD, and inhabited by ancestors of the Shona people of Zimbabwe,
    Mapungubwe was the centre of the largest kingdom in the subcontinent, trading
    gold and ivory with China, India and Egypt. Made of gold foil wrapped around a
    wooden core, the rhinoceros is a symbol of leadership among the Shona.\n\nRhinos
    have been represented in rock art for more than 30,000 years, and have played
    a significant spiritual and cultural role in African societies.\n"

    settlement from 1652 onwards has been well-documented - with devastating consequences
    socially, economically and culturally for many indigenous populations. \nOne of
    those impacts was the demise of rock art as a cultural practice by many San|Bushmen,
    with the last rock art being made around 100 years ago. Nevertheless, rock art
    has provided some interesting glimpses into Colonial events, experiences and encounters
    from an indigenous perspective. Depictions of ships, horse-drawn wagons, guns
    and people wearing European clothing are not simply observational records in stone,
    but tell of history and heritage, memory and identity. This type of rock art,
    one that depicts European objects and people, is termed '*contact art*'.\n"

  body: Throughout the 15th century, Portuguese mariners navigated the western coast
    of Africa exploiting the lucrative trade possibilities on the continent. In 1487,
    Bartholomeu Dias’s expedition of two 50-ton caravels (small, fast Portuguese sailing
    ships of the 15th–17th centuries) anchored in Mossel Bay on the Southern Cape
    coast because of a storm, later sailing along the coast to Algoa Bay (east of
    the Cape of Good Hope) before returning to Lisbon. Ten years later, in 1497 another
    Portuguese expedition led by Vasco de Gama sailed along the eastern coastline
    to modern day Mombasa before crossing the Indian Ocean to India (Thompson, 2014:31)

  body: On 25 March 1647 the Dutch vessel, the *Nieuwe Haerlem*, was wrecked in a
    storm in Table Bay. Sixty crewman and a junior merchant named Janszen remained
    in the Cape for a year waiting for another vessel to collect the crew and rescued
    cargo to return to Holland. During the waiting period Janszen and his crew grew
    vegetables, bartered fresh meat from the Khoi and fished. Upon his return to Holland
    in 1649, Janszen produced a report for the Dutch East India Company on the feasibility
    of the Cape as a refreshment station. Janszen recommended it for its strategic
    location, the fertility of the land, the abundance of fish and most importantly,
    the lack of animosity towards strangers of the indigenous people (Adjibolosoo,
    2001:141) Three years later, in 1652, Jan Van Riebeek and 80 employees of the
    Dutch East India Company arrived as commander of the Cape with the aim of building
    a fort and supplying the Dutch fleets with fruit, vegetables and meat (Thompson,
    2014:32). Van Riebeek established what is now Cape Town and is seen by many Afrikaaners
    as the founding father of their nation.

    way of life in the Cape had all but disappeared either by the active dispossession
    of land, sustained political interference or enforced labour. For the indigenous

    led to the beginnings of the extinction of local indigenous culture” (Yates *et

  body: The detailed depiction of the vessel suggests that the artist was visually
    familiar with European ships. However, while three of the mast flags are pointing
    in the same direction, the flag on the mizzenmast (far right in the image) flies
    in the opposite direction, suggesting the artist was less conversant with the
    technology of sailing ships. In 2016, British Museum curators requested that the
    image of the Porterville Galleon was assessed by experts at the National Maritime
    Museum, who identified a cross on the shoreline (on the left of the image) and
    the ship to the right, including a bow, short bowsprit crossed with a spritsail
    yard, and three masts with Dutch flags. The combination of these features suggests
    the ship dates to the mid-seventeenth century date, coinciding with sinking of
    the *Nieuwe Haerlem* and the founding of Cape Town (Giblin and Spring, 2016:69).

    Bay on the Southern Cape coast, the black charcoal outline of a sailing ship is
    drawn in a deep and broad crevice. Reddish-orange paint was applied to the rock
    surface first and may have served as a background or canvas on which the ship
    was then painted. The ship is superimposed on numerous fine line red paintings
    of human figures and animals as well as a series of 13 red handprints and black
    dots (Leggatt and Rust, 2004: 5). Although the site is more than 30km from the
    coast, the details of the ship visible above the water line are portrayed in clear
    detail. The depiction of the sailing ship corresponds with what we know of sailing
    ships rounding the Cape of Good Hope from the end of the 16th century.  \n\nThe
    tricolour design of the flag on the mainmast suggests that the ship represents
    a Dutch vessel (Leggatt and Rust, 2004: 6). Prior to 1595 the only sailing ships
    known to have visited Mossel Bay were Portuguese vessels, which did not fly tricolour
    flags. Moreover, they attempted to avoid the southern African coast after a conflict
    with Khoe herders in Table Bay in 1510. The first Dutch sailing ships under the
    command of Cornelis de Houtman anchored in Mossel Bay on 4th August 1595, spending
    a week in the harbour bartering iron for cattle with the local populations (Leggatt
    and Rust, 2004:6).\n"

    and San|Bushmen hunter-gatherers who were the indigenous populations when Dutch
    ships started landing around the southern coastline of South Africa.\n\n*Swartruggens*\n\nLater
    colonial period rock art can be found in a cluster of sites in the Swartruggens
    Hills, on the eastern margins of the Cederburg Mountains. Increasingly, European
    farmers started using the Swartruggens for grazing, and by 1728 some colonists
    were present in the region. The relative isolation of the area provided a refuge
    for escaped slaves, discontented employees of the Dutch East India Company and
    the remaining populations of the Khoisan communities (Hall and Mazel, 2005:127).
    \ \n\nThe rock art at Swartruggens comprises a limited but repeated set of motifs.
    These include men in European clothing, notably wearing wide-brimmed hats and
    boots, and women wearing bell-shaped crinoline dresses, cinched in at the waist.
    Many of the dresses are patterned with vertical and horizontal stripes.  The shape
    and style of these dresses are reminiscent of those that dominated western female
    fashion between 1830-1860, and the grid pattern was a popular pattern during this
    time (Hall and Mazel, 2005:132). Some men are depicted smoking pipes and firing

    free and harnessed pulling wagons (Hall and Mazel, 2005:131). Of the 340 images
    at the site of Stompiesfontein, 165 are images of horses with 33 depictions of
    wagons - more than half the total number of images. Wagons are generally depicted
    in profile being pulled by team of 4, 6 or 8 horses (Hall and Mazel, 2005:134).
    The drivers of the wagons are clearly identified, wearing large brimmed hats holding
    long whips. In all cases the artist has depicted the interior of the wagon clearly
    showing the transportation of both men and women and in some cases children.  Alongside
    the wagons are men driving packhorses or mules with others riding on horseback.
    A repeated feature in the wagon panels is the depiction of women who are always
    positioned above the wagons and encircled by finger dots (Hall and Mazel, 2005:135).
    The use of horse-drawn transport has been dated to around the early 19th century
    and coincides with the development of better road systems from Cape Town into
    the southern and eastern Cape regions (Hall and Mazel, 2005:136) However, until
    1848, with the opening of Michell’s Pass, the area around Swartruggens was not
    easily accessible by horse-drawn wagons, which make a probable date of later than
    1850 for the paintings (Hall and Mazel, 2005:137).

    Many of the wagons depicted at Swatruggens are of a type known as the Spring Wagon or Spring Wagonette. Of South African design, these wagons were manufactured in large numbers in the last three decades of the 19th century in response to the demand for transport to the diamond mines in the north of the country (Hall and Mazel, 2005:138). As such, the wagons seen in the Swartruggens rock art are likely to have been painted from the 1870s onwards but before 1885 when the railroad reached the diamond region of Kimberley in the north.

    The contact period rock art at Swartruggens then seems to depict a certain event during the late 19th century when people were moving northwards seeking wealth and fortune. The production and reception of these images “stemmed from local, social, political and economic conditions of the farm labourers, squatters, drovers and shepherds - whom we assume were among the artists” (Hall and Mazel, 2005:141).

  body: "The identity of the artists and their relationships with the figures depicted
    is an interesting yet complex one. Do the images simply portray experiences of
    contact with Europeans or were the artists framing themselves within these tableaux?
    It is likely that wagons are the property of the Europeans and that the majority,
    if not all, of the passengers depicted are European. \n\nA common posture for
    figures painted outside of the context of wagons is a characteristic hands-on-hips
    posture, which has been identified as an European stance. Interestingly, this
    is a universal convention employed by contact period artists around the world
    in their depiction of both male and female European colonists (Hall and Mazel,
    2005:142). This convention may possibly just be an observation of cultural differences,
    but as Hall and Mazel have suggested, “it potentially makes a wry comment about
    a posture of arrogance and people in the possession of idle hands“ (Hall and Mazel,
    12005:142). In the rock art of the Swartruggens there does not appear to be any
    intentionality on the part of the artists to insert themselves into the scenes,
    “the people, events and episodes depicted are of the Europeans’ world and the
    art seems to be all about ‘outsiders’” (Hall and Mazel, 2005:143).\n"

  title_internal: 'Contact Art: thematic, chapter 12'
  body: However, this does not apply to other examples of contact rock art. Recent
    research has shown that some depictions in the Maloti-Drakensberg reveal a cultural
    admixture of both European and indigenous elements. In the 19th century, groups
    comprising San-, Khoe- and Bantu-speaking peoples came together to form a new
    cultural identity. These short-lived but culturally mixed groups reflected the
    social, economic and political milieu of 19th century South Africa, raiding their
    European neighbours for cattle and horses, exchanging them for corn, tobacco and
    dogs (Challis, 2012:265). As well as being ethnically diverse, they shared certain
    customs and belief systems.  In this “creolised” (Challis, 2012:80) rock art depictions
    show figures on horseback, armed with guns, bows, spears, and knobkerries, wearing
    feathered headgear , wide-brimmed hats, tasselled armbands and skin capes (Challis,
    2012:277)

  title_internal: 'Contact Art: thematic, chapter 13'
  body: Moreover, as well as the adjacencies of European and local material culture,
    rock art depictions show that traditional belief systems were incorporated into
    these tableaux. Some images depict figures engaged in dancing a variation of the
    Trance Dance, a traditional San medicine dance whereby shamans would enter altered
    states of consciousness and are represented transforming into symbolic animals
    such as the eland. Contact rock art amalgamates this with elements of Nguni (a
    local and indigenous cultural group of South Africa) culture and shamans transform
    instead into baboons, a symbolic animal for the Nguni that is associated with
    ideas of protection (Challis, 2014:249).

  title: Summary
  title_internal: 'Contact Art: thematic, chapter 14'
  body: Not simply a visual record of encounters and experiences, contact rock art
    is as complex socially, politically and culturally as the period in which it was
    created. Depiction of European encounters sit within a framework of local rock
    art traditions and belief systems as well as colonial history.

  title: Introduction
  title_internal: 'Nigeria: country, chapter 1'
  body: In general, West Africa is not well known for its painted or engraved rock
    art and does not have a long history of rock art research. The scarcity of paintings
    may be predicated on the topography and more humid conditions of the climate,
    but the shortage of discovered sites to date may indicate that the paucity of
    evidence is genuine. Painted rock art occurs in the north of the country and comprises
    humpless cattle, monkeys, antelope and human figures, mainly painted in red. More
    unique sculptural forms include standing stones engraved with stylised faces and
    codified motifs, found to the south, and are reminiscent of the burial stelae
    at Tuto Fela in Ethiopia (link here to the article on Standing Stones of Ethiopia
    on the website).

    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: featured site, chapter 1'
    body: The site of Shepe (also known as Chabbé, Šappe or Mancheti) is located in
      the Sidamo Zone of Oromia, about 250 km to the south of Addis Ababa. The region
      is a fertile, forest-mountainous area traditionally dedicated to the cultivation
      of coffee. The site is in a narrow gorge carved by the Shepe River at 1300 m
      above sea level, full of vegetation and therefore difficult to detect. Along
      this gorge there are several notable  engravings depicted in four panels, forming
      one of the most impressive – if secluded —  rock art sites in the Horn of Africa.
      The site was discovered in 1965 by Fitaorari Selechi Defabatchaw, governor of
      the Dilla district where the site is located, and was published by Francis Anfray
      two years later. Since that, the importance of Shepe has been widely recognized
      and some other sites with similar engravings have been documented in the surrounding
      area. This group (known generically as the Shepe-Galma group) constitutes one
      of the main areas of Ethiopian rock art, the other being the Laga Oda-Sourré
      group in the Harar region.

    body: 'The rock art of Shepe consists almost exclusively of engravings of humpless
      cows which follow very strict conventions: profile bodies, small heads with
      long horns seen from above, U-like bellies and udders very clearly depicted.
      Some of the cows have an unidentified, triangular object hanging from their
      left horn. In total, around 50 relatively large cows (40 to 70 cm in length)
      are depicted throughout the gorge walls, distributed in rows and groups to represent
      herds. The most original feature of these engravings is, however, the technique
      used to depict them: rather than carving the outline of the cows, the area around
      them has been lowered to provide a bas-relief effect which has no known parallels
      in the region. The surface of the cows has been polished to obtain a smooth
      appearance.'

    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: featured site, chapter 3'
    body: The chronology of the Shepe cows is difficult to determine, but stylistically
      they have been related to the Laga Oda paintings in the area of Harar and to
      other sites in Eritrea and Djibouti. According to most researchers, the Shepe
      figures have been ascribed to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabian style, with a
      generic chronology from the 3rd to the 1st millennia BC. Shepe engravings can
      be considered relatively naturalistic, and therefore should be among the oldest
      depictions of this style. Other interpretations, however, consider Shepe and
      the nearby sites a completely differentiated school whose chronology is still
      unclear but could be more recent.

    body: Regarding their meaning, only conjecture can be made at present, but it
      seems quite likely that they were made by pastoral communities to whom cattle
      were fundamental. The careful depiction of the udders, the repetition of this
      single motif and the effort paid to achieve the bas-relief effect imply a paramount
      importance of cattle in the economy and society of the group that engraved them.
      The fact that some of the cows have what seem to be adornments hanging from
      the horns (a feature documented in other rock art regions as the Libyan Messak)
      also points in that direction. Contemporary groups, such as the Nuer in nearby
      Sudan have similar traditions of horn adornments, and throughout the Omo river
      region different techniques of embellishment (ear cutting, horn shaping, modifications
      of the hump) have been documented, and in all of them cattle are a key cultural
      mark as well as an economic resource.  Of course, direct links cannot be established
      between these contemporary examples and the communities that made the engravings
      of Shepe, but the cattle depictions in the ravine are nevertheless a document
      of the importance and consideration given to cattle, an animal which was undoubtedly
      part of these groups’ identity.

    body: Laas Geel, one of the most important rock art sites in the region, is located
      in the north-western part of the Horn of Africa, in Somaliland, in the road
      that links Hargeisa and Berbera. The site is placed on a granite outcrop that
      rises from a plateau at an altitude of 950 meters above sea level, at the confluence
      of two seasonal rivers, a key fact to explain the existence of rock art in the
      outcrop. Even today, the name of the site (“the camel’s well” in Somali) makes
      reference to the availability of water near the surface of the wadis. The panels
      are placed at three different levels and distributed mostly throughout the eastern
      flank of the outcrop, although isolated depictions can be found in other slopes.

    body: The site was discovered in 2002 by a French team led by Xavier Gutherz which
      studied the beginning of Pastoralism in the Horn of Africa. Along with the paintings,
      lithic tools were found scattered throughout the site, and tombs marked with
      stelae and mounds can be seen in the neighbourhood. The paintings are distributed
      along 20 rock shelters, the biggest being around 10 meters long. Most of them
      correspond to humpless cows with curved or lyre-like white horns (sometimes
      with reddish tips) and marked udders. Paintings are enormously colourful, including
      red, white, black, violet, brown and yellow both isolated and combined. However,
      the most distinctive feature of these cows is their necks, depicted rectangular,
      abnormally wide and either blank or infilled with red and white stripes, either
      straight or wavy. These strange necks have been interpreted as mats hanging
      from the actual neck, in what could be interpreted as a ceremonial ornament.

      surrounded by a halo of radial dashes as a crown. These figures always appear
      related to the cows, either under the neck, between the legs or behind the hindquarters.
      In some cases they carry a bow, a stick or a shield. Along with humans and cows,
      dogs are well represented too, usually positioned near the human figures. Other
      animals are much scarcer: there are some figures that could correspond to antelopes,
      monkeys and two lonely depictions of a giraffe. Throughout most of the panels,
      geometric symbols are also represented, often surrounding the cows.'

    body: Unlike many other rock art sites, Laas Geel has been dated quite precisely
      thanks to the excavations carried out in one of the shelters by the French team
      that documented the site. During the excavation parts of the painted rock wall
      were recovered, and therefore the archaeologists have proposed a chronology
      of mid-4th to mid-3rd millennia, being one of the oldest evidences of cattle
      domestication in the Horn of Africa and the oldest known rock art site in this
      region. Unfortunately, although bovine bones were recovered from the excavation,
      they were too poorly preserved to determine whether they correspond to domestic
      or wild animals.

    body: When discovered, Laas Geel was considered a unique site, and although its
      general characteristics corresponded to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabic style,
      its specific stylistic features had no parallels in the rock art of the region.
      As research has increased, some other sites, such as Dhaga Koure, Dhambalin
      and Karin Hagane, have provided similar depictions to those of Laas Geel, thus
      reinforcing the idea of a distinctive “Laas Geel” style which nevertheless must
      be interpreted within the broader regional context.

    body: 'Laas Geel is a marvellous example of the potential of African rock art
      still waiting to be discovered and studied. Not only the quality of the images
      depicted is astonishing, but the archaeological data associated with the site
      and the landscape itself help to reconstruct a key episode in human history
      elsewhere: the moment in which animals started to be domesticated. The strong
      symbolism which surrounds the figures of cows and humans is a permanent testimony
      of the reverence these communities paid to the animals that provided their sustenance.'

    body: 'Lake Victoria is the largest lake in Africa, and at 69,484km², the second
      largest in the world by surface area.   Sitting in a depression in the plateau
      between the eastern and western valley branches of the geological East African
      Rift System, its shores are in Uganda, Tanzania, and to the south-east, in Kenya.   Mfangano
      Island, rising 300m out of the lake near the Kenyan shore, is home to some of
      the most prominent rock painting sites in the country, featuring abstract patterned
      paintings thought to have been created between 1,000 and 4,000 years ago by  hunter-gatherers.   The
      rock paintings on Mfangano Island are found at two principal sites:  in a cave
      near the sea known as Mawanga, and at a rock shelter further inland called Kwitone.'

    body: Mawanga is a roughly triangular limestone cavern, about 18m wide across
      the mouth and 12m deep.  The roof slopes sharply to the back towards a raised
      platform against the rear of the left wall, on which 12 images of concentric
      circles and spirals in white and red have been painted. Kwitone has similar
      paintings, situated at one end of a long overhang in a sandstone cliff, below
      the shoulder of a ridge.  The rock art at Kwitone is at the far end on the shelter
      wall, several metres above a cleared floor section. The paintings here feature
      11 distinct shapes including concentric circles and oblongs. One of these is
      a prominent sunburst pattern in brown, with rays emanating from the outermost
      band. The images are larger than those at Mawanga, averaging around 40cm in
      diameter, and less faded, exhibiting more brown pigment, although both sites
      appear to reflect the same artistic tradition. These are finger paintings, with
      pigment probably made of haematite or white clay mixed with a natural binder
      such as egg white or urine. There is evidence that the surface may also have
      also been prepared prior to painting, by polishing, and that some of the images
      may have reapplied or retouched over time.

    title_internal: 'Kenya: featured site, chapter 3'
    body: The circular shapes seen here are typical of an apparent wider East and
      Central African rock art tradition featuring a preponderance of circular motifs,
      usually attributed to people known as the Batwa, a Bantu-origin name for  a
      series of culturally related groups historically living around Africa’s Great
      Lakes region and more widely throughout Central Africa.  Like the San people,
      who are known to have been the creators of most of the famous rock art of Southern
      Africa, Batwa were traditionally hunter-gatherers, and are considered the most
      ancient indigenous populations of the area. In the early 20th century, it was
      proposed that East African rock art of this tradition could have been the work
      of ancestral San people, but it is now generally assumed to be of Batwa origin
      with, for example, possible parallels to be seen in the symbolic iconography
      with contemporary barkcloth designs of the related Mbuti people from the Democratic
      Republic of Congo (Namono, 2010).

    body: 'Further examples of apparently Batwa origin rock art can be seen in neighbouring
      Uganda and Tanzania, a reminder that contemporary political borders do not reflect
      physical partitions in the spatial coverage of rock art traditions.  Lolui Island,
      about 50km north west of Mfangano Island and  in Ugandan waters, is another
      important Lake Victoria rock art environment, featuring both painting sites
      and rock gongs (sonorous natural percussive instruments with the wear of use)
      which seem to be associated with the painting sites. There are also numerous
      sets of cupules—ground circular depressions in the rocks.  Some of these are
      referred to locally as Omweso, due to their bearing some resemblance to  the
      depressions used for holding gaming pieces in the so-named local variant of
      the Mancala-type board games played widely throughout eastern Africa.  However,
      their original significance and use is unknown.   Cupule sites are also found
      on the Kenyan mainland and on Mfangano island.  Many of these are clearly anthropogenic,
      however an unusual phenomenon is to be noted in the spectacular array of naturally
      formed cupule-like depressions in the limestone of Mawanga cave. This may remind
      us to exercise caution in ascribing ‘rock art’ status to all apparently patterned
      rock formations. The cause of these multitudinous small depressions is so far
      unknown. '

    body: 'The rock art sites of the eastern Lake Victoria region retain spiritual
      connotations for the communities living around them, even if their denoted modern
      significance differs from that envisioned by the original artists. The modern
      inhabitants of Mfangano Island are the Abasuba people, a Bantu language-speaking
      group unrelated to the Batwa who have nevertheless appropriated the sites as
      arenas of spiritual importance.  Members of the Wasamo clan in the area around
      Mawanga remember their having used the site for rain making rituals until a
      few decades ago, with red and white pigment apparently representing the moon
      and sun respectively.  Soot on the cave roof may indicate other recent human
      activity there. When the archaeologist James Chaplin—who first investigated
      the Kwitone site in the 1960s—visited it later, he was told by local Wagimbe
      clan people that they also held the paintings there to be associated with some
      taboos, and connected it with ancestor worship. These beliefs reflect events
      of the recent past, as the Abasuba only moved into the area in the last 400
      years.  This followed an earlier occupation by Luo peoples, prior to which habitation
      by the Batwa is assumed. The local importance of the sites is highlighted in
      their stewardship by the Abasuba Peace Museum, which fosters a continuing relationship
      with the sites and those who live around them. '

    body: At the nexus of Sudan, Libya and Egypt, where the borders meet at a point
      in the Eastern Sahara, a large rocky outcrop known as Jebel Uweinat peaks at
      an elevation of nearly 2,000 metres. The massif consists of a large, ring-shaped
      granite mass in the west, with sandstone plateaus in the east divided by deep
      valleys. Jebel Uweinat is so isolated that, until 1923, the proliferation of
      rock art around it had never been documented.

    body: This rock art comes in the form of paintings and engravings, commonly of
      animals and overwhelmingly of domestic cattle – 337 painted sites out of 414
      that have been counted contain depictions of cattle and cattle herds, and there
      are many further engravings of them. There is a disparity in the spread of each
      artwork technique – the engravings are predominantly at lower levels than the
      paintings, near the base of the mountain and valley floors, with the paintings
      at greater altitude. The images shown here come from Karkur Talh, the largest
      of these valleys, which lies mostly in Sudan.

      wild antelope and dog figures, as well as many engravings of camels.

    body: This variety, and similarities to rock art sites elsewhere in the eastern
      Sahara, has led to conjecture and debate regarding the date and authorship of
      these depictions. Were the engravings and paintings made by the same people?
      Does the difference in drawing styles signify authorship by different cultures
      and at different times? The difficulties in objective dating of rock art make
      these questions difficult to answer, but it seems likely that there was a long
      tradition of painting and engraving here, with much of the ‘pastoralist’ rock
      art with cattle probably made between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago, some earlier
      styles possibly as much as 8,500 years ago, and other images such as camels
      made only about 2,000 years ago or less.

    body: Other than giraffes, the lack of large wild animals depicted (e.g. elephants)
      may indicate the climate to have been too dry for them, as during this time
      the area fluctuated in aridity, eventually becoming desert. There are, however,
      permanent springs at Jebel Uweinat and a more temperate microclimate here may
      have allowed pastoralists to subsist while the surrounding area became inhospitable.
      Indeed, despite its present remoteness, evidence suggests millennia of successive
      human presence, and as recently as the early 20th century, herders of the Toubou
      peoples were reported to be still living in the area. The camel engravings cannot
      be much older than 2,000 years, because camels were unknown in Africa before
      that, and the recent discovery of an ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription
      from the Early Middle Kingdom serves to confirm that Jebel Uweinat has never
      really been ‘undiscovered’, despite having been unknown to Western geographers
      prior to the 20th century.

      First documented in 1913 (in the Teso Report&dagger;), the geometric paintings at Nyero are among the most important and well documented rock art sites in Uganda, and are on the Tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage sites&Dagger;.

      Nyero is located in eastern Uganda in the Kumi District, about 200 km from the capital city Kampala.  It comprises six rock shelters in total, but initially only three were recorded and referred to as shrines by local communities, who had no knowledge of the origins of the paintings. The authorship of the paintings remains in some debate.

      Initially, the rock art was thought to be the work of San|Bushmen of southern Africa. However, archaeological, genetic and ethnographic evidence has subsequently attributed the paintings to the ancestors of Batwa people, hunter-gatherers who are descendants of ancient aboriginal groups once spread across East and Central Africa and most probably the original inhabitants of this landscape. Today they live in small groups near the Rwanda/Uganda border.

      More recent studies have proposed that the rock art was the work of settled human groups and not early hunter-gatherers. It has been proposed that rock shelters were used by semi-nomadic peoples devoted to animal herding, and used as reference points in the landscape. Generally positioned away from flat land, they may have served to direct herders of cattle and/or goats towards paths and water. The unknown identity of the rock artists makes dating problematic, but some of the paintings may be up to 12,000 years old.
      Notwithstanding the problems associated with attribution and chronology, many of the rock paintings in Uganda show serious damage due to long exposure to the elements. At Nyero 2, the paintings are partially covered with mineral salts, while at Nyero 5 the paintings have been destroyed or are obscured by rain wash-off. The physical condition of the paintings is testament to their antiquity.

      __Nyero Rock Art sites:__

      __Nyero 1__
      This is a small rock shelter on the outer edge of the outcrop and comprises six sets of concentric circles with a central image of a ‘floral motif’ and a so-called ‘acacia pod’ shape. The geometrics in this shelter are all painted in white.

      __Nyero 2__
      This is the main shelter, the overhang of which is formed by an enormous boulder (estimated to weigh at least 20,000 tons) which has broken away; a vertical rock against the back wall measures 10m in height. The panel at Nyero 2 consists of more than forty images such as vertical divided sausage shapes, so-called ‘canoes‘, unidentified faint markings, ‘U’ shapes, lines and dots, with evidence of superimposition; but is dominated by concentric circles. A unique feature of the paintings are the so-called ‘canoes’ or parts of ‘canoes’, so-called because of their resemblance in form. The depictions are all painted in shades of red.

      The paintings are protected from direct rain by the overhang and rocks to the front and sides protect the paintings from the sun, which is likely to have contributed to their preservation. Early users of the shelter placed ritual gifts on its south-eastern side; the tradition of using this space to place money either before or after receiving help from ancestral spirits is continued by the local community.
      As well as the rock art, a bone incised with three concentric circles and four parallel lines, and pieces of prepared ochre were excavated from this site in 1945.  These are the only evidence of prehistoric portable art so far found in Uganda.

      __Nyero 3__
      Located about eight minutes’ walk from Nyero 2, this shelter is formed by a large boulder perched on supporting rocks. Paintings consist of white concentric circles; the outer circles surrounded by double curved designs, between which are double lines divided into small compartments.

      __Nyero 4__
      This is a small shelter on the south-western side of the hill where there are a few traces of red finger-painted concentric circles, two conical shapes and lines.

      __Nyero 5__
      Situated on the western side of the hill, this shelter has a red geometric motif composed of a combination of circular and linear shapes made with both a brush and a finger. However, the images are quite difficult to distinguish as they are damaged by natural water erosion.

      __Nyero 6__
      Situated on the top of the hill, this shelter has a good view of the landscape. This site features two red finger-painted outlines of small oval shapes and a slanting L-shape as well as an outlined cross with a small circle below. The painted surface is now subject to severe exfoliation as it is open to the rain and morning sun.

      The sites at Nyero are believed locally to have been sacred ancestral places where, in the past, people would have travelled long distances to make offerings of food, beer and money in times of drought, misfortune and for child birth. Nyero was also regarded as a magical place where rain ceremonies were held. Oral histories have recorded strong attachments to the site and individual and community prayers were held seasonally. The antiquity of the images and their association with long-forgotten peoples may serve to enhance Nyero as a special and sacred place for local communities.

      These skilfully engraved images depict long-horned cattle with their heads bowed. Thought to date between 7,000 and 8,000 years ago, today these images stand alone in a vast wilderness of sand and rock. However, this environment was once wetter and more fertile, and this site may have been close to a local watering hole where animals regularly drank and bathed. Indeed, even today during the rains, the depression in the sand at the base of the inselberg fills up with water, which gives the appearance that the cows are bending their heads to drink.

      These engravings are incorporated in a local myth that tells of a shepherd who engraved the crying cows after travelling night and day with his herd to a spring he thought would quench their thirst. Finding it dry, he captured in stone his cattle’s grief as he watched them die one by one. Climatic data has shown a number of significant cooling events in the North Atlantic, one of which – dating to around eight thousand years ago – resulted in a period of aridity lasting a number of centuries across the Sahara, and may coincide with these engravings and of the associated myth.

    body: In artistic terms, the execution of this panel of engraved cows is extremely
      accomplished and testifies to someone who was not only a skilful carver but
      who we might even regard as a sculptor in the modern sense, who understood both
      materials and the interplay of light and shade in the reductive process of carving.
      But even more than this, the artist understood the environmental conditions
      in which he was working. It has been observed that the depth and thickness of
      the engraved lines has been carefully calculated to ensure that as the sun travels
      across them during the day, they appear to move. This sense of movement is made
      most acute as the evening shadows, falling into each groove, give the cattle
      a sense of mass and movement. Other artistic devices, such as double lines with
      recessed areas and internal polishing, evoke a perception of depth and density.
      The interplay of light and shade is consummately adept and dynamic, and the
      sculptural quality of the image sensorially evocative. This is the work of a
      practised craftsman, who demonstrates a deep of understanding of materials,
      techniques and the natural environment.

    body: The ‘Cave of Swimmers’ is the larger of two shallow caves situated side
      by side in the southern part of the Gilf Kebir plateau in Egypt’s Western Desert,
      an area so remote and inaccessible that its existence only became known to European
      cartographers in 1926. It is so named due to the human figures painted on its
      walls with their limbs contorted as if swimming. It has since become world-renowned,
      particularly as a key location in the feature film *The English Patient* (1996),
      based on Michael Ondaatje’s novel of the same name.

    body: The book and film feature fictionalised versions of the cave and its real-life
      discoverer, László Almásy, as the title character. In reality, Almásy was a
      charismatic figure in pre-war Saharan exploration. He argued that the ‘swimming’
      figures suggested the prior existence of abundant water in the area and was
      therefore evidence that it had not always been arid desert, a radical new theory
      at the time that has since been confirmed, although not on the basis of these
      paintings as evidence. Rock art is notoriously difficult to date as it was a
      tradition practiced for thousands of years. These paintings have been dated
      at between 9,000 and 6,000 years ago, although some researchers have suggested
      both earlier and later dates.

      Oukaïmeden is an alpine-like valley set 2,630 metres above sea level at the core of Morocco’s High Atlas. Records from the 16th century onwards refer to its seasonal profit as summer pasturage by herders coming from villages settled at mid-altitude. It is a well-known place due to the existence of a ski resort, and a well-frequented tourist destination for people coming from Marrakech during the summer. It is also home to one of the most impressive collections of rock art engravings in Morocco, with about 250 rock art sites and one thousand depictions scattered throughout the valley.
      Oukaïmeden rock art has been thoroughly studied by Malhome (1959, 1961) and Rodrigue (1999), and along with the Yagour plateau and Jbel Rat constitute the core of High Atlas rock art.

    body: High Atlas rock art is remarkably different not only from the rest of Moroccan
      rock art, but also from most other depictions documented throughout the Sahara.
      Although some of the engravings correspond to cattle depictions similar to those
      of nearby regions, there are other images known only in this region. One particular
      type comprises detailed, large human figures represented frontally, surrounded
      by weapons and other symbols. Another common kind of depiction is circular shapes
      with inner designs, which most probably represent shields. Weapons are also
      very common, usually depicted in isolation, but not held by warriors as is common
      in most of the North African images. Together with these themes, Oukaïmeden
      is characterised by a significant number of elephant representations (something
      surprising considering its altitude!) and a huge number of complex, geometric
      symbols whose interpretation remains obscure.

    body: Chronologically speaking, it seems Oukaïmeden engravings started to appear
      during the mid-3rd millennium BC, when the Sahara desert became increasingly
      drier and summer grazing became more and more important. The earliest depictions
      consisted mainly of animals, especially cattle, which was the species that benefited
      the most from green pastures. As time passed, pressure on this resource grew
      and tensions arose among the communities that used the valley. From the 2nd
      millennium BC onwards, animal depictions were replaced by images of weapons
      and warriors, showing a different, more violent way of reclaiming rights over
      pastures. That situation continued during the long Libyan-Berber period that
      started around the mid-1st millennium BC and lasted until the Muslim conquest
      of the area, around the 7th century AD. The arrival of Islam does not imply
      the immediate disappearance of rock art engravings, but their number decreased
      significantly and they progressively lost their significance, becoming incidental
      in Oukaïmeden history.

      Although Oukaïmeden rock art is distributed throughout the valley, there are some sites with scenes that stand above the rest due to their complexity and significance. One of them is the so-called Elephants’ Frieze, a horizontal rock face where four elephants, a feline, a rhinoceros or warthog and two human figures facing the animals were depicted. Two later, vertical Libyan-Berber inscriptions were added to the panel. The scene is placed near a shelter, facing a stream which constitutes one of the main access routes to the valley grazing areas.

      The relevance of Oukaïmeden rock art is renowned, and the whole area has been protected since 1951 by the Moroccan government, while the National Centre of Rock Art Heritage in Marrakech has carried on several research projects in the area. However, the interest in the site doesn’t mean its preservation is assured: the growing incidence of tourism, the extraction of stones for building purposes in nearby Marrakech and vandalism are threats that have still to be dealt with. The fragile environment of Oukaïmeden valley adds an extra concern about the preservation of one of the most complete and better-preserved rock sites in Morocco.

    body: Running from the Red Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, the Sahara is by far the
      world's largest hot desert. It covers over 3,500,000 square miles (9,000,000
      sq. km), a tenth of the whole African Continent. Yet we know it was not always
      so. Archaeological and geological research has shown that the Sahara has undergone
      major climatic changes since the end of the last Ice Age (c. 10,000 BC). During
      this period, rain was far more abundant, and vast areas of the current desert
      were a savannah. By around 4,200 BC, changes in the rainfall and seasonal patterns
      led to a gradual desertification of the Sahara into an arid expanse. The analysis
      of archaeological sites, animal bones and preserved vegetal remains tell us
      of a greener world, where some of the earliest attempts at domestication of
      animals and rudimentary farming took place.

      Little is known about the people who lived in the Sahara thousands of years ago; however, through rock art, we can discern who they may have been and what images were important to them. Throughout the desert, rock art engravings and paintings depict an earlier story of the Sahara: the wild animals that lived there; the cattle herds that provided food and labour; their daily activities and beliefs are all displayed in caves and cliffs, valleys or plateaus.

      The Messak Settafet is one of these places. Situated in the Sahara, it is a large plateau running southwest to northeast through the Libyan province of Fezzan, near the borders of Algeria and Niger. Both plateaus are crossed by numerous wadis (dry riverbeds) that run to the east, flanked by cliffs filled with tens of thousands of rock art depictions, including some of the oldest engravings in the Sahara. Rich with depictions of the savannah, the rock art shows buffaloes, crocodiles, ostriches or hippopotami, all of which tells us of a wetter Sahara thousands of years ago.

      It is difficult to determine the motives of the people that created these images. There are many theories about why these people created rock art, what exactly is depicted and what the images meant to that group. One area of particular research interest is the depiction of mythical beings, therianthropic figures (part human part animal) and anthropomorphic animals (the personification of animals in human forms). Were these religious images? Cultural folklore? Or simply images pleasing to a group or culture?

      and carefully polished bodies and carved cupules within their heads to depict
      eyes. Claws were also marked, maybe to reinforce the idea of fighting. The specific
      type of animal depicted is subject to debate among scholars. Some have described
      them as monkeys or mythological blends of monkeys and men. Their pointed ears
      could also identify them as cat-like figures, although most probably they were
      the representation of mythical beings, considering their prominence above all
      other figures in this area. A polished line comes out from the waist of both
      figures to join four small ostriches, depicted between them, which often accompany
      rock art in this region.

      Another example of fighting cats has been found nearby, although it is neither so carefully made nor in such a prominent place. The similarity is, however, astonishing, and we may wonder if this second pair of beings could be a copy of the first pair, thus reflecting its symbolic importance in the people’s collective imagination.

      As is often the case with rock art, the interpretation of these images remains up for discussion. Given the care taken to engrave the images, their technical quality and their dominant position in the landscape, we can gather that these images potentially had deep meaning for the people who created them thousands of years ago, and were possibly meant to be a symbolic as well as a physical landmark for travellers and local people alike. Although the original purpose and meaning have long since been lost, the expressive power of the engravings still remains, allowing us to gain a small view into the world of the people that lived in the Sahara thousands of years ago, when it was a sprawling green savannah.

    body: Dabous is located in north-eastern Niger, where the Ténéré desert meets
      the slopes of the Aïr Mountains. The area has been part of the trans-Saharan
      caravan trade route traversed by the Tuareg for over two millennia, but archaeological
      evidence shows much older occupation in the region dating back 8,000 years.
      More recently, it has become known to a wider global audience for its exceptional
      rock art.

      Recorded in 1987 by French archaeologist Christian Dupuy, two remarkable life-size engravings of giraffe have generated much interest due to the size, realism and technique of the depictions. The two giraffe, thought to be one large male in front of a smaller female, were engraved on the weathered surface of a sandstone outcrop. The larger giraffe measures 5.4 m from top to toe and combines several techniques of production, including scraping, smoothing and deep engraving of the outlines.

      Each giraffe has an incised line emanating from its mouth or nose, meandering down to a small human figure. This motif is not unusual in Saharan rock art, but its meaning remains a mystery. Interpretations have suggested the line may indicate that giraffe were hunted or even domesticated, or may reflect a religious, mythical or cultural association. It has also been suggested that the lines and human figures were later additions.

      The engravings cannot be seen from ground level; they are only visible by climbing onto the boulder. They are thought to date from between 6,000 and 8,000 years ago – a period known as the Neolithic Subpluvial, when environmental conditions were much wetter and the Sahara was a vast savannah stretching for thousands of miles, able to sustain large mammals such as giraffe. The soft sandstone is likely to have been incised using a harder material such as flint; there are chisels of petrified wood in the surrounding desert sands which would have acted as good tools for abrading and polishing outlines. It is easy to imagine people in the past sitting on the rocky outcrop watching these long-necked, graceful animals and immortalising them in stone for future generations.

      We can only speculate as to why the giraffe was selected for this special treatment. Any number of physical, behavioural, environmental or symbolic factors may have contributed to its significance.

      While the giraffe have taken centre stage at this site because of their size and the skill of the execution, a systematic study of the area has identified 828 further engravings, including 704 zoomorphs (animal forms), 61 anthropomorphs (human forms), and 17 inscriptions of Tifinâgh script. The animals identified include: bovines (cattle ) (46%), ostrich (16%), antelope and gazelle (16%), giraffe (16%), and finally 12 dromedaries (camels), 11 canids (dog-like mammals), 6 rhinoceros, 3 equids (horses or donkeys), 2 monkeys, 2 elephants, and 1 lion.

      Who might the artists have been? It is often the case in rock art research that artists are lost to us in time and we have little or no archaeological evidence that can offer insights into the populations that occupied these sites, sometimes only for a short time. However, in 2001 a site called Gobero was discovered that provides a glimpse of life in this region at the time that the Dabous engravings were produced.

    body: Gobero is located at the western tip of the Ténéré desert in Niger, approximately
      150 km south-east of the Aïr Mountains. Situated on the edge of a paleaolake
      and dating from the early Holocene (7,700–6,200 years ago), it is the earliest
      recorded cemetery in the western Sahara and consists of around 200 burials.
      Skeletal evidence shows both male and females to be tall in stature, approaching
      two metres. Some of the burials included items of jewellery, including a young
      girl wearing a bracelet made from the tusk of a hippo, and a man buried with
      the shell of a turtle.

    body: This cultural group were largely sedentary; their subsistence economy was
      based on fishing (Nile perch, catfish, soft-shell turtles) and hunting (hippos,
      bovids, small carnivores and crocodiles). Microlithis, bone harpoon points and
      hooks, as well as ceramics with dotted wavy-line and zig-zag impressed motif
      were found in burials, refuse areas and around the lake. A hiatus in the occupation
      of the area (6,200–5,200 years ago) occurred during a harsh arid interval, forcing
      the occupants to relocate. The Gobero population may not be the artists responsible
      for Dabous, but archaeological evidence can help formulate a picture of the
      environmental, social and material culture at the time of the engravings.

      of human intervention such as trampling, graffiti and fragments being stolen.
      As a result, the decision was made to preserve them by making a mould of the
      carvings in order to make a cast in a resistant material. Permission was granted
      by both the government of Niger and UNESCO and in 1999 the moulding process
      took place. The first cast of the mould, made in aluminium, stands at the airport
      of Agadez in the small desert town near the site of Dabous – an enduring symbol
      of the rich rock art heritage of the country.

    body: A significant concentration of rock art in Mauritania is in the region of
      Guilemsi, an 11-km long ridge, about 70 m high at its highest point. Guilemsi
      is located in the desert, around 50 km north of the town of Tidjika, and about
      200 km west of the renowned Neolithic sites at Dhar Tichitt. Guilemsi’s south
      face contains many ravines with rock shelters, and the rock painting sites scattered
      around the area are to be found in open shelters and ridges or boulders on the
      cliff faces, as well as on the stone banks of a dry river. These sites are notable
      both for the solely painted nature of the rock art, and the variety of its subject
      matter.

    body: There are many stone constructions at Guilemsi that have been known to archaeologists
      for decades, although they have not received the academic attention that those
      further to the East in the Tichitt-Walata region had. The Dhars Tagant, Tichitt,
      Walata and Néma form an enormous crescent-shaped chain of sandstone escarpments,
      enclosing much of southern Mauritania and associated with a Neolithic ‘Tichitt
      Tradition’, which is based on the remains of over 400 apparent settlements along
      the escarpment ridges. This culture is thought to have existed between about
      2,000 BC and 200 BC, based on pastoralism and the cultivation of millet, before
      declining due to the increasing aridity of the environment and possible incursion
      by other cultural groups from the North.

    body: The Tichitt Tradition is characterised by dry stonewall remains, and these
      are found at Guilemsi, although the extent of the connection with the Tichitt
      culture to the East is unclear. The ridge at Guilemsi contains many apparent
      funerary monuments consisting of rectangular stone platforms, as well as apparent
      dwelling structures. Some of the funerary monuments appear to be associated
      with rock shelters, but any connection of the stone structures to the rock art
      remains unknown.

    body: The rock art at Guilemsi appears to be all painted, which marks a contrast
      to Tichitt sites which more often feature engraved rock art. The only non-painted
      rock markings encountered at Guilemsi was several groups of cupules (round,
      man-made depressions in the rock) which were found in three rock shelters. Some
      of the paintings in the area are unusual in themselves- one of the most striking
      is a panel of handprints in red (Fig. 4.), as well as a couple of rare paintings
      appearing to be of big cats, and the heads and finely rendered horns of seven
      antelope, perhaps oryx (Fig. 5.).

    body: 'Cattle, perhaps the most common animal subject in Mauritanian rock art,
      are also depicted here, notably in another singular scene: one of an otherwise
      naturalistic cow with dramatically elongated legs, next to an artificially inflated-looking
      human figure (Fig. 8). Domestic cattle were present in the area from at least
      the second Millennium BC, so these paintings must post-date this, although whether
      they are associated with Tichitt-Tradition pastoralists or later groups is not
      known. The fact that even the more normally-proportioned cattle representations
      at Guilemsi are depicted in a variety of styles (Figs. 6 & 7) while in the same
      vicinity may suggest successive (or perhaps even contemporary) painting by peoples
      with different stylistic traditions.'

    body: 'Two of the most impressive panels of paintings from Guilemsi involve not
      cattle but another important domesticate: ridden horses. There is evidence of
      horses having reached the far West of North Africa by about 600 AD, but horses
      may have been used in the area much earlier, from the mid-1st Millennium BC,
      if not earlier. Although elsewhere in the Sahara the earliest horse images appear
      to show them used for draught purposes rather than riding, in Mauritania, almost
      all depictions of horses in rock art show them being ridden, often by apparently
      armed riders (eg. Fig. 11). At Guilemsi, there are several styles of paintings
      showing horses and riders: the ‘bi-triangular’ and stick-figure like styles
      (Figs. 10 & 11), which have been proposed to be associated with early Berber
      peoples, and another style, showing horses with elongated, stylised bodies and
      short necks (Fig. 9). These horse depictions appear to be of a form thus far
      unrecorded in the rock art of the area, and as such are an interesting addition
      to the known corpus, as Mauritanian rock art has not been as thoroughly studied
      as that of other Saharan countries.'

    body: Another very interesting tableau is that in Fig. 11, which is to the right
      of the panel in Fig. 9, but in executed in a very different style. It appears
      to depict a group of armed horsemen, and warriors on foot, vanquishing others
      who are unmounted, who lie, presumably dead, to the left of the horsemen, surrounded
      by spears. This is an unusually dynamic depiction of conflict, and it is not
      known whether it depicts an imagined or real confrontation, or, if real, whether
      it is the work of an artist from the culture of the horsemen or those opposing
      them.

      It has been suggested that the painting of the horse scenes, in line with similar images from other rock art traditions, may be a cathartic spiritual exercise made, possibly by victims of raids, in response to violent intercultural contact. However as with the other images, without an accurate way of scientifically dating such paintings, it is hard to know exactly when they were painted and therefore difficult to propose of or by whom, much less ascribe motivations. Stone tools and the remains of iron smelting activity at Guilemsi suggest successive occupations, possibly over a long period.

      Stylistic links to other sites may be made, however: despite the fact that some of the iconography at Guilemsi appears quite unique, other elements, such as the bichrome cow in Fig. 6, and other square figures at Guilemsi of a man and giraffe, have similar looking counterparts in the Tichitt region, while the “bi-triangular” horses are found elsewhere in the Tagant and Adrar regions of Mauritania, and even as far away as Chad. Understanding of these links is still nascent, as is the interpretation of most Mauritanian rock art, but the variety present at Guilemsi is a valuable addition to the record, and more such sites may remain to be brought to the notice of scholars.

    body: The Ennedi Plateau is a mountainous region in the north-eastern corner of
      Chad, an impressive sandstone massif eroded by wind and temperature changes
      into series of terraces, gorges, cliffs and outliers. Although it is part of
      the Sahara, the climate of the Ennedi Plateau is much more suitable for human
      habitation than most of the desert, with regular rain during summer, wadis (seasonal
      rivers) flowing once or twice a year, and a relatively large range of flora
      and fauna – including some of the few remaining populations of Saharan crocodiles
      west of the Nile. Throughout the caves, canyons and shelters of the Ennedi Plateau,
      thousands of images – dating from 5000 BC onwards – have been painted and engraved,
      comprising one of the biggest collections of rock art in the Sahara and characterised
      by a huge variety of styles and themes.

    body: 'Within this kaleidoscope, a series of engravings have become especially
      renowned for their singularity and quality: several groups of life-sized human
      figures depicted following very regular stylistic conventions. They were first
      reported internationally in the early 1950s; during the following decades more
      sites were discovered, almost all of them around Wadi Guirchi, and especially
      near a site known as Niola Doa. To date, six sites have been documented, totalling
      about 40 depictions. Most of the figures were engraved on big, vertical boulders,
      in groups, although occasionally they appear isolated. They follow a very regular
      pattern: most of them are life-sized or even bigger and are represented upright
      facing right or left, with one arm bent upwards holding a stick resting over
      the neck or shoulder and the other arm stretched downwards. In some cases, the
      figures have an unidentified, horizontal object placed at the neck, probably
      an ornament. Interspersed among the bigger figures, there are smaller versions
      which are slightly different, some of them with the arms in the same position
      as the others but without sticks, and some facing forwards with hands on hips.
      In general, figures seem to be naked, although in some cases the smaller figures
      are depicted with skirts.'

      buttocks and thighs, which have been interpreted as steatopygia (a genetic condition
      resulting in an accumulation of fat in and around the buttocks). Although the
      best documented examples of steatopygia (both in rock art and contemporary groups)
      correspond to southern Africa, steatopygic depictions occur elsewhere in North
      African rock art, with examples in other parts of the Ennedi Plateau, but also
      in Egypt and Sudan, where they occasionally appear incised in pottery.

      In addition, almost all the figures are decorated with intricate geometric patterns (straight and wavy lines, squares, meanders and, in one case, schematic birds), which could be interpreted as garments, tattoos, scarifications or body paintings. In some cases, figures appear simply outlined, but these very rare cases were probably left unfinished. The decorative patterns extend to the ears, which are always depicted with geometric designs, and to the head, where these designs could correspond to hairstyles.

      The decorative richness of the Niola Doa engravings has led to their interpretation as ritual scenes, probably special occasions when body decoration was part of a more complex set of activities with dancing or singing. On some occasions, comparisons have been established between the geometric designs of Niola Doa and different types of body decorations (body painting, scarifications). Scarifications, in particular, have a long tradition within some African cultures and in many cases parallels have been documented between this kind of body decoration and material culture (i.e. pottery, pipes, wood sculptures or clothes). The relative proximity of groups with well-known traditions of scarifications and body painting has led to comparisons which, although suggested, cannot be wholly proved.

    body: 'Regarding their chronology, as with most rock art depictions the Niola
      Doa figures are difficult to date, although they undoubtedly belong to the older
      periods of Chadian rock art. Some parallels have been made with the Round Head-style
      figures of the Tassili n’Ajjer (Simonis et al 1994). However, the Round Head
      figures of Algeria have a very old chronology (up to 9000 years ago), while
      the rock art at the Ennedi Plateau is assumed to be much newer, up to the 5th
      or 4th millennium BC. These engravings could, therefore, correspond to what
      has been called the Archaic Period in this area, although a Pastoral Period
      chronology has also been proposed. In several other sites around the Ennedi
      Plateau, similar images have been painted, although whether these images are
      contemporary with those of Niola Doa or correspond to a different period is
      unclear. Regardless of their chronology, what is undeniable is the major impact
      these depictions had on later generations of people living in the area: even
      now, the engravings at one of the sites are known as the ‘Dancing Maidens’,
      while the name of Niola Doa means ‘The place of the girls’ in the local language.'

    body: "The superimpositions in the panel above show that the red, schematic paintings
      covering most of the rock face are undoubtedly older than those made in white.
      \ Representations include a multitude of geometric signs: series of parallel
      lines, grid-style shapes, concentric ovals and circular shapes made with series
      of dots.  In some cases the red signs were infilled with series of tiny white
      dots, a feature uncommon in the red schematic rock art depictions but with the
      best examples represented here in Namzeze.  Its interpretation, as with most
      geometric depictions, is a challenging issue, but these types of paintings have
      been traditionally related to ancestors of  Batwa people, hunter-gatherers,
      who inhabited the region until the 1800s.  Studies of Batwa ethnography and
      cosmology point to these places as related to fertility and rainmaking ceremonies.
      \ It is difficult to establish the chronology.  The oldest occupation documented
      in the region is dated to the mid-first millennium BC, and the red images precede
      the arrival of the Chewa people in the 2nd millennium AD, responsible for the
      white paintings style, but there is no datable evidence for the paintings.  \n"

    body: The second type of painting found in Namzeze is radically different and
      depicts mainly quadrupeds and birds, as well as some geometric symbols and a
      car, proof of a relatively recent date for some of these paintings. Quadrupeds
      have a very characteristic rectangular body and hooves that in some cases are
      represented as feet.  The technique is very different too, consisting of white
      clay daubed on the wall with the fingers.  These white figures usually appear
      surrounding the previous depictions, in some rare occasions overlapping them.  In
      this case, the authorship, chronology and interpretation of the paintings are
      more straightforward.  Researchers agree that these types of paintings have
      been made by the Chewa, a group of farmers that arrived to the region around
      the 16th century and have maintained rock art painting traditions until the
      20th century (as the car represented in this shelter proves).

    body: 'Regarding the interpretation of the paintings, they are directly related
      to the *nyau*, a secret society of the Chewa and other neighbouring groups in
      Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique which plays a significant role in funerary and
      girl’s initiation ceremonies.  The *nyau* rituals include dancing and rely heavily
      on the use of masks, including face masks as well as other mobile structures
      carried by one or two people.  These masks are central for the *nyau* secret
      society and are kept in secret, hidden from non-initiates.  The white paintings
      of Namzeze and many other sites have been interpreted as representations of
      masks, depicted during initiation ceremonies that took place in these isolated
      shelters where secrets of the *nyau* were explained to the new initiates.  '

    body: "In fact, some of the more than 100 types of masks can be easily identified
      in the rock shelters.  The most common is the *kasiyamaliro*, a big structure
      representing an antelope, with a rectangular shape and meant to be carried by
      two people (an [excellent example](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=472359&partId=1)
      can be seen in Room 25 in the British Museum), but others, such as the *Galimoto*
      (a car structure) and birds are also documented.  Some of the features of the
      animals depicted in this panel corroborate with this interpretation: the shape
      of the hooves which is more similar to feet, and the fact that in some cases
      the feet of the forelegs and the hind legs are facing each other, as if they
      corresponded to two different people. Some researchers have interpreted this
      feature as a pictorial tool to teach people the proper way of wearing and using
      the structure to avoid stumbling, which would expose the men hidden in the structure
      and thus the secret of the mask would be revealed.  \n"

      specific period of time (before that other styles of white paintings were used),
      when the secret society was persecuted first by Ngoni invaders in the 19th century,
      then by missionaries and colonial governments in the 20th century. With their
      traditional practices and places forbidden, the members of this society had
      to look for alternative ways to teach the secrets of the secret society secrets,
      with the paintings starting to represent *nyau* objects, to be used as a didactic
      tool.  The Namzeze paintings show very explicitly the adaptability of societies
      to their different challenges and historical contexts. Either as a tool to summon
      the rain or as a coded message to transmit sacred secrets, the painted symbols
      depicted in Namzeze show the incredible complexity of rock art meanings throughout
      time, and their importance for the communities that painted them.  \n"

      in the Namibe province on the south-west corner of Angola, by the edge of the
      Namib desert, about 120 km from the sea.  It is a semi-arid plain characterized
      by the presence of several inselbergs (isolated hills rising from the plain),
      the most important of which is Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume.  The group of rock art
      sites are surrounded by several seasonal rivers, within a maximum distance of
      1 km.  Tchitundu-Hulu was first documented by José Camarate Andrade França in
      1953, and since then it has become one of the most studied rock art sites in
      Angola, attracting the interest of renowned researchers such as  Abbé Breuil,
      J.  Desmond Clark and Santos Junior.  In 2014 one of the sites was the subject
      of a Masters dissertation (Caema 2014), the latest addition to the long term
      research on the site.  '

    body: 'The chronology of the Tchitundu-Hulu rock art is difficult to establish,
      and it is unclear if the four sites are of the same period at all.  Theories
      based on the lithic tools dispersed throughout the area ascribed the paintings
      to an ancient time period, possibly  tens of thousands of years old.  Radiocarbon
      samples coming from the excavation of Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume showed a date in
      the early 1st millennium BC, although the relation of the archaeological remains
      and the paintings has not been proved and archaeological materials of a more
      modern period were also located.  A sample taken from the pigments at the site
      rendered a date of the beginning of the first centuries of the 1st millennium
      AD.  In any case, Tchitundu-Hulu hosts some of the oldest examples of rock art
      in the country, and it has been linked to the schematic traditions that characterize
      the rock art of Central Africa, more abundant in central Mozambique and Malawi.  '

    body: The question of who made the engravings or paintings is another complex
      issue for the interpretation of the Tchitundu-Hulu depictions.  The harsh conditions
      of this semi-desert area probably favoured a seasonal occupation of the region
      during the rainy season.  The location of Tchitundu-Hulu at the edge of the
      desert could also have made this place a strategic site for the communities
      living in the region.  Several local groups - Kwisi, Kuvale - have traditionally
      inhabited the area, but the authorship of these engravings and paintings and
      the motives for creating them remains obscure, as does the purpose and cultural
      context of the complex images of Tchitundu-Hulu.

    body: The Kondoa rock art sites are located on the eastern slopes of the Maasai
      escarpment, which borders the western side of the Great Rift Valley in central
      Tanzania, covering an area of over 2,336 km². Stretching for around 18 km along
      the escarpment, the exact number of rock art sites in the Kondoa area is unknown
      but is estimated to be up to 450, the oldest of which are thought be more than
      2,000 years old. The extensive and spectacular collection of rock paintings
      are attributable to both hunter-gatherer and pastoralist communities and the
      images are testament to the changing socio-economic environment in the region.
      The hunter-gatherer rock paintings of Kondoa are dominated by human figures
      and animals. While a dark reddish brown predominates, other colours include
      yellow, orange, red and white.  Some of the shelters are still considered to
      have cultural associations with the people who live nearby, reflecting their
      beliefs, rituals and cosmological traditions. In 2006, Kondoa was nominated
      and listed as one of UNESCO’s World Heritage rock art sites in Africa.

    body: "The sites at Kolo are the most famous of the Kondoa paintings. Kolo comprises
      three rock art sites, known as Kolo 1, 2 and 3. The main site, Kolo 1 (known
      locally as Mongomi wa Kolo) is a large, imposing rock shelter that is only accessible
      by following a winding path at the end of a dirt road. This site contains many
      fine-line red paintings, some of which are very faded; but the site is still
      used by the local community for secret rituals. Kolo 2 is located south of the
      main site and includes human and animal figures, while Kolo 3 is north of Kolo1
      and is characterised by human, animal and geometric figures. The renowned palaeontologist
      Mary Leakey surveyed and documented many of the paintings at Kolo in the 1950s.
      \ The examples we see here are thought to have been made by early hunter-gatherer
      groups, ancestors of the modern Sandawe, one of the first cultural groups to
      inhabit Kondoa.   \n\n"

      eland, rhinoceros and wildebeest; while human figures are represented as slender
      and elongated, often with elaborate hairstyles or headdresses, holding bows
      and arrows. Groups of figures are also shown bent at the waist, with some appearing
      to take on animal characteristics. These paintings have been associated with
      Sandawe cultural beliefs. \n\nThe Sandawe communicate with the spirits by taking
      on the power of an animal and some features at Mongomi wa Kolo can be understood
      by reference to the Sandawe traditional practice known as simbó (Ten Raa 1971,
      1974). Developing Ten Raa’s observations, Lewis-Williams (1986) proposed that
      simbó is the ritual of being a lion, and that simbó dancers are believed to
      turn into lions. Lim (1992, 1996) adopted a site-specific approach to the rock
      art and has suggested that the importance of place is as important as the images
      themselves. According to Lim the potency of a place is produced through ritual
      activities, so that meaning resides in the process of painting in a particular
      location, rather than in the painted image itself.  \n"

      Ritual Practices

      Ritual sites are generally located near fig and baobab trees, and springs. However, about 3 m south of the main Kolo shelter, a cavity underneath a huge boulder is used, even today, by local diviners, healers and rainmakers to invoke visions and communicate with the spirits. Oral traditions indicate that Mongomi wa Kolo is considered more powerful than other ritual places in Kondoa, and its unusual location may contribute to its efficacy.  The other two shelters of Kolo 2 and 3 are also used for ritual ceremonies.

      __Conservation__

      When Mary Leakey was surveying the Kondoa rock paintings in 1983 she predicted that if serious preservation and conservation measures were not put in place the paintings would be destroyed by 2020. Although inscribed onto the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2006, it has been noted paintings are being destroyed by the dust from the ground and in some cases rainwater is causing the paintings to deteriorate.

      Moreover, the documentation of paintings at Kondoa is incomplete, and some areas have not been surveyed at all. Bwasiri (2008) advocates an urgent need to collate all existing information in this region and implement a sites and monuments record that also takes into account living heritage values.

    body: 'Tsodilo Hills, located in north-west Botswana, contains around 400 rock
      art sites with more than 4,000 individual paintings, and has been termed the
      “The Louvre of the Desert”.  Designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2001,
      Tsodilo comprises four main hill: Male Hill, Female Hill, Child Hill and North
      Hill with paintings occurring on all four. This region shows human occupation
      going back 100,000 years.  At sunset the western cliffs of the Hills radiate
      a glowing light that can be seen for miles around, for which the local Juc’hoansi  call
      them the “Copper Bracelet of the Evening”.'

    title: Rock Art
    title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 2'
    body: The paintings at Tsodilo are unique in comparison to other San|Bushmen rock
      art in both techniques and subject matter. San|Bushmen paintings are well-known
      throughout southern Africa for their fine-line detail because they were brush
      painted, but those at Tsodilo are finger painted. In addition, 160 depictions
      of cattle are portrayed in the same style as wild animals, and more geometric
      designs appear here than anywhere else. Tsodilo animal drawings are larger and
      the geometric designs simpler than those found elsewhere.  In comparison to
      human figures elsewhere in southern Africa, those at Tsodilo appear without
      bows and arrows, clothing or any forms of personal ornamentation.  In addition,
      numerous cupules and grooves are incised and ground into rock surfaces, sometimes
      close to painted rock art sites and some on their own. For the residents of
      Tsodilo, the hills are a sacred place inhabited by spirits of the ancestors.

      animals, human figures and geometric designs. Unusually, animals, mainly large
      mammals and cattle have been depicted in twisted perspective with two horns

    body: While most of the images in the Tsodilo Hills seem to be discrete depictions,
      some sites show figures. Some of these figures are with cattle as well as women
      standing in rows in connection with animal groups, possibly showing some relationship
      with each other. Additionally, some of the rock art in the Tsodilo Hills shows
      superimposition, but this occurs infrequently. In some cases red geometric designs
      superimpose animals, but geometric designs and animals never superimpose human
      figures, nor do images of cattle ever superimpose other images – which may suggest
      some kind of relationship or hierarchy.

    body: White finger-painted images appear more crudely executed and are made from
      a powdery or greasy white pigment. More than 200 paintings at 20 different sites
      show paintings in this style, half of these depictions occur in White Paintings
      Shelter alone. Subject matter includes people facing forwards with their hands
      on hips, figures riding horses, a possible wagon wheel and a figure standing
      on a wagon, as well as an elephant, rhino, giraffe, eland, cows, antelope, snakes,
      unidentified animals and geometric designs, particularly “m” shapes. White paintings
      occur at sites with red paintings and often superimpose them.

    title: Cupules/Grooves
    title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 8'
    body: There are no engravings at Tsodilo representing animals or human figures,
      but more than 25 sites show evidence of small round depressions ground into
      the rock, known as cupules, as well as various shaped grooves that have been
      chipped and ground into the rock. The majority of sites are found on Female
      Hill, with four on Male Hill and one site on Child Hill. Cupules tend to measure
      about 5cm or more wide and less than a 1 cm deep, although larger examples occur.
      They can occur at painted rock art sites but also on their own. For the most
      part they are found in groups ranging from 5 to 100 and in three cases, considerably
      more. For example, in Rhino Cave there are 346 carved into a vertical wall and
      nearly 1,100 at Depression Shelter. The purpose or meaning of cupules is unknown;
      they may have denoted a special place or the number of times a site had been
      visited. However, we have no dates for any of the cupules and even if they are
      adjacent to a rock art site, they are not necessarily contemporaneous. From
      their patina and general wear it has been proposed that some cupules may date
      back tens of thousands of years to the Middle Stone Age. If paintings also existed
      at this time they have long since disappeared.

    body: Grooves are less common than cupules, but are often easier to detect. They
      occur in small groups of 3 to 15 and are elongated oval or canoe-like in shape,
      and are found mostly on horizontal or near-horizontal surfaces. Their function
      is unknown, although a thin slab of stone with a curved round edge was excavated
      from Depression Shelter which matched one of the grooves in the shelter.

    title: Who were the artists?
    title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 10'
    body: "It is a bit of a mystery about who actually created the paintings at Tsodilo,
      as the red images at Tsodilo do not fit neatly into other known styles of rock
      art in southern Africa. They do not show the fine brush work of San|Bushmen¹
      in other parts of southern Africa, nor the cruder style of white paintings attributed
      to later Bantu-speaking farmers.\n\nIt is possible that they were painted by
      the Khoesan during the first millennium AD, the original settlers in the area
      who made stone tools and herded livestock. A local Ncaekhoe man (a Central San
      people) claims his ancestors made the paintings and it is possible that some
      or many of the cattle images were painted by pastoral ancestors of Ncaekhoe.
      \n\nThe white paintings are more difficult to attribute authorship, although
      as they are comparable to the red paintings, comprising the same subject matter
      of elephant, rhino, giraffe and antelope as well as geometrics, they may reflect
      a later version of the red tradition.\n\n"

    title: Dating
    title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 11'
    body: The paintings at Tsodilo are often faded because they are located on rock
      faces exposed to the sun, wind and rain. As such, dating them scientifically
      is problematic as little or no suitable organic material remains. However, cattle
      paintings may help to date the art. There are about 160 depictions of cattle,
      which were common around the Tsodilo Hills between 800–1200 AD. As the cattle
      depictions are stylistically similar to other animal depictions it has been
      suggested that this seems to be a plausible date for most of the art (Coulson
      and Campbell, 2001:103)

    title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 13'
    body: "Giraffe, eland and rhino are by far the most common species depicted at
      Tsodilo, followed by elephant, gemsbok and cattle. However, these images tend
      to be discretely rendered and there does not appear to be any relationship between
      images on the same rock. \n\nRepresentations of people are simply painted and
      generally stick-like, identified to gender by either penis or breasts. In some
      cases this may represent sexual virility and fertility, although in scenes where
      both occur it may merely indicate gender differences.\n\nCattle seem to appear
      in the rock art at the same time as human figures. In one scene, three figures,
      one leading a child, has been interpreted as either herding or stealing cattle
      (Campbell, Robbins and Taylor, 2010:106). Three other sites show cattle depicted
      with what may be mythical rain animals. \n"

      consistency across a wide area and are likely to have had some symbolic meaning.
      In Zambia, geometric designs are thought to have been be made by women and associated
      with the weather and fertility, while depictions of animals were made by men.
      The geometric rock art of Tsodilo fits into a pattern of similar imagery in

      to the south-west of Zimbabwe, in Matabeleland, one of the two main rock art
      regions in the country. It is a large region, more than 2000 sq. km, characterized
      by granite hills separated by nearly parallel valleys where the vegetation consists
      of scattered woodlands and areas covered by grass with an abundance of wild
      fruits. The region was occupied since at least the Middle Stone Age, but the
      human presence increased in the last millennia BC. The region holds an incredible
      amount of rock art; as many as 3,000 sites have been estimated based on the
      better surveyed areas. Paintings constitute the vast majority of depictions,
      although occasional engravings have also been reported. Paintings are usually
      found in rock shelters and associated with archaeological remains, which show
      an occupation of the area since the Early Stone Age. '

      depicted in a slender style, facing left or right but with the upper part of

      of animals such as smaller antelopes, giraffes, zebras, ostriches, monkeys,
      eland antelope, rhinoceros and to a lesser extent carnivores are also depicted.
      The animals are represented in very different attitudes and may be depicted
      standing still, running or lying. Humans and animals are often related in hunting
      scenes. Along with animals and human figures, a fair number of geometric symbols
      are present, including a very characteristic type of motif made of a series

    body: "Many of the depictions in the Matobo Hills are associated with hunter-gatherers,
      providing a great amount of information about the social, economic and spiritual
      life of these groups. Depictions of daily objects (bows, vessels, digging sticks,
      cloaks) appear depicted in the rock art, and humans are shown hunting animals,
      fighting other groups and dancing in what seem to be ritual scenes. In fact,
      many of the scenes show strong similarities to those found in the Drakensberg
      (South Africa), and part of the iconography in the Zimbabwean paintings – ‘therianthropes’
      (part-human, part-animal figures), elongated figures, rain animals, geometric
      figures – can be easily related to trance or rain-making activities similar
      to those seen in South Africa. These paintings have been interpreted as representing
      the trance experiences of shamans (the term ‘shaman’ is derived from Siberian
      concepts of Shamanism and its applicability to San|Bushman¹ cultures has been
      questioned, but it is utilised here on the understanding that it sufficiently
      represents trancers in this academic context, where it is the most frequently
      used term to describe them). However, unlike in South Africa, the Matobo Hills
      rock art is not recent and researchers lack the key ethnographic records that
      help us to interpret the paintings. Therefore, interpretations cannot be directly
      extrapolated from the South African paintings to those of the Matobo Hills,
      and researchers such as Peter Garlake have broadened the interpretative framework

    body: 'Not all the paintings in the Matobo Hills can be ascribed to groups of
      hunter gatherers, though. Although fewer, there are some paintings that correspond
      to a later period which were made by Iron Age farmers. Unlike in South Africa,
      rock art does not show evidence of interaction between these two groups, and
      it is probable that the hunter-gatherers that inhabited the area were either
      displaced or absorbed by these new farmer communities. However, some of the
      later paintings show some links with the previous hunter-gatherers traditions.
      This later art consists mainly of schematic figures (usually animals, including
      domestic ones such as goats and cows) and geometric symbols, mostly depicted
      in white but also red or black and smeared with the hand or the fingers. '

    body: "Game Pass shelter is one of the most well-known rock art sites in South
      Africa. Situated in the foothills of the Drakensberg mountains, a sandstone
      recess atop a steep slope contains rock paintings made by people from the San|Bushman¹
      communities who historically lived as hunter-gatherers throughout southern Africa.
      The Drakensberg mountains in particular are known for their wealth of rock paintings,
      often showing detailed and brightly coloured images of people, animals and part-human,
      part-animal figures known as ‘therianthropes’, with this site a prime example.
      One of the panels of paintings here is particularly important in the history
      of rock art research, as in the 1970s it helped to inspire a new kind of approach
      to the understanding of the meanings and symbolism of San|Bushman paintings
      and engravings.\n\n"

    body: The most prominent painting panel at Game Pass shows a series of carefully
      depicted eland antelope in delicately shaded red, brown and white pigment, largely
      super-imposing a group of ambiguous anthropomorphic figures wrapped in what
      appear to be bell-shaped karosses (traditional skin cloaks). Several small human
      figures appear to be running above them. These are some of the best-preserved
      rock paintings in the Drakensberg, with the largest animals around 30 cm long.  To
      the left of this panel are two smaller sets of images, one with two further
      eland, some further human-like figures and a human figure with a bow; the other
      (Fig. 1 below) a small panel, for which the site is most renowned.   An image
      around 50 cm long  shows an eland with its face turned towards the viewer, depicted
      as if stumbling forwards, with its hind legs crossed.  Grasping the eland's
      tail is a therianthrope figure with hooves for feet. Like the eland, this figure
      has its legs crossed and is depicted with small lines like raised hairs bristling
      from its body. To the right are three further therianthrope figures.

    body: The rock paintings from this site were first brought to public attention
      in a 1915 issue of Scientific American, and it has been frequently published
      on and discussed through the 20th century.  While studying a reproduction of
      the image with the stumbling eland in the early 1970s, researcher David Lewis-Williams
      began to consider that the figure holding the eland's tail (Fig. 2 below) might
      not be a simple illustration of a man wearing a skin suit, or performing an
      act of bravura, as had been suggested by previous researchers, but might be
      “idiomatic and metaphorical, rather than illustrative” (Lewis-Williams 1981:91).

    body: "This idea was partly inspired by the testimony of Qing, a San|Bushman man
      who, in 1873, had guided the Colonial Administrator Joseph Millerd Orpen to
      rock art sites in the mountains of Lesotho, with which the Drakensberg forms
      a natural eastern border with South Africa and which also contains many rock
      paintings. Qing's explanations of the paintings, some of which Orpen copied,
      included a reference to antelope-headed human figures having “died and gone
      to live in rivers, who were spoilt at the same time as the elands and… by the
      dances of which you have seen paintings”. This, along with testimony and practices
      recorded from other South African San|Bushman people at the time, as well as
      those living elsewhere in south-western Africa in the 20th century, suggested
      to Lewis-Williams that these and other images in San|Bushman rock art may be
      a reference to the activities of spiritual leaders or 'shamans', people who,
      in San|Bushman communities, are believed to have the power to interact with
      spirits and the spirit world in ways which may affect the physical world. \n\nLewis-Williams
      and other proponents of this 'shamanistic' approach to interpreting San|Bushman
      rock art have proposed that much of its imagery is in fact related to the shaman's
      experience during the 'trance dance' ritual found in all San|Bushman socie-ties.
      During this activity the shaman enters a hallucinatory state in which spiritual
      ‘tasks’ such as healing the sick may be undertaken on behalf of the community.
      On entering the trance state the shaman experiences trembling, sweating, stumbling
      and other symptoms similar to those of a dying antelope hit by a poisoned arrow.
      Lewis Williams noted that among some San|Bushman people this process is referred
      to as ‘dying’ or being ‘spoilt’ and considered that the similarities between
      the eland and the therianthrope figure in this image represent this conceived
      equivalence.\n\n"

      Despite the historical presence of other large game animals in the Drakensberg, the eland is the most commonly depicted animal in rock art of the region. Patricia Vinnicombe, noting this and the focus on other particular subjects in the imagery at the expense of others, proposed in her pioneering 1976 study of the rock art of the Southern Drakensberg *People of the Eland* that the paintings are “not a realistic reflection of the daily pursuits or environment of the Bushmen” (Vinnicombe 1976:347). Vinnicombe recalled that when, in the 1930s, an old Sotho man named Mapote, who had San|Bushman half-siblings and had used to paint with them, was requested to demonstrate, he had said that since the San|Bushmen had been “of the eland”, he should first depict an eland. Based on this and recountings of a myth about the creation and death of the first eland from Qing and other contemporary Southern San|Bushman people, Vinnicombe concluded that the eland, although regularly hunted by the Drakensberg San|Bushmen, had been a particularly sacred or powerful animal to them and that “Through the act of painting and re-painting the eland… the mental conflict involved in destroying a creature that was prized and loved by their deity…was…ritually symbolised and resolved” (Vinnicombe, 1976:350).

      Building on the idea of the spiritual significance of the eland, the approach proposed by Lewis-Williams offered an alternative interpretation by inferring from ethnography that eland were believed to have spiritual ‘potency’. As part of a complex system of beliefs involving conceptions of power and potency in relation to animals and rites, this potency could be released upon death, with trancing shamans believed to be able to harness it, feeling themselves taking on the attributes of the animal. Thus therianthrope figures like those depicted here may be interpreted as representing hallucinatory experiences of shamans in trance, where they may feel that they are assuming the forms of other animals. It has been argued that other motifs such as geometric forms known as 'entoptics' represent the abstract patterns created by neural networks and ‘seen’ during the early stages of entering an altered state of consciousness and that the paintings themselves may have been created as reservoirs of spiritual potency.

      which the Game Pass panel is sometimes referred to as the ‘Rosetta Stone’, gained
      popularity in the 1980s and has since become the dominant interpretative framework
      for researchers. Debate continues about the extent and nature of its applicability
      in all of San|Bushman rock art, and the extent to which myth and ritual not
      associated with the trance dance may also inform the art. Work that connects
      San|Bushman cosmology and practice with images from sites like Game Pass continue
      to provide interesting insights into these enigmatic images. \n\nGame Pass Shelter
      and many other rock art sites are situated within the Maloti-Drakensberg Park,

      area and home to over 2,000 engravings, the rock art sites are situated near
      a small but permanent spring. The site was first formally noted by Reinhard
      Maack in a 1921 report to the Administrator of South West Africa, following
      a report to him from a surveyor named Volkmann mentioning the engravings, near
      a spring Volkmann named as Uais (/Ui-//aes= place among rocks or jumping waterhole
      in Khoekhoegowab, the language of the local Damara people).  Later, the land
      came into the use of farmer David Levin, whose concern over the survival of
      the spring led ultimately to its being referred to as Twyfelfontein (‘doubtful
      spring’ in Afrikaans). In 1963 Ernst Scherz visited the site as part of his
      work to record rock art sites throughout South West Africa.  Scherz documented
      around 2,500 images in the wider valley area, while a 2005 survey of the core
      site found 2,075 individual images on 235 separate rock surfaces.  '

      looped and linear forms, as well as circles and polished depressions and cupules.  In
      addition there are numerous depictions of animals, ranging in style from more
      naturalistic to stylised and distorted.  Chief among the animal images is the
      giraffe, which is most numerous.  Also common are images of rhinoceroses, zebra,
      gemsbok antelope and ostriches.  There are occasional depictions of cattle but
      images of human beings are almost absent.  Also featured are images of human
      footprints and animal spoor (hoof and paw prints).

    body: The figurative images in the engraved art feature several different distinct
      styles, ranging from very naturalistic outlines of animals such as giraffes
      and rhinoceroses, through carefully delineated but stylised or distorted renditions
      of these animals with exaggerated extremities, to very schematic pecked outlines.  One
      particular aspect of style is a form of relief engraving, whereby in some deeply
      pecked figures' muscle masses are delineated.  In others, the infill pecking
      is graded and  sparser in the centre of a figure, giving the impression of shading.  A
      few of the engravings are highly polished.  Perhaps most renowned among these
      is the “dancing kudu” image, a stylised image of a kudu antelope cow rendered
      atop a flat slab of rock and surrounded by geometric shapes.

    body: "It appears that the kudu figure is pregnant and it has been suggested that
      the choice of this animal may have been made in relation to female initiation
      practices. This is because the female kudu has a symbolic importance relating
      to women’s behaviour in the cosmology of some San|Bushman¹ people, traditionally
      hunter-gatherer people whose ancestors are thought to have made most of southern
      Africa’s rock paintings and engravings.  Other animals known to have symbolic
      and metaphorical significance to San|Bushman people are also depicted here (giraffe
      images are most numerous) and these images have been interpreted in the vein
      of other southern African rock art sites, where images are thought to reflect
      the experiences of shamans while in a trance state, and may have multiple metaphorical
      and other cultural meanings.  \n\nThe engravings were certainly made in strategic
      locations and not simply on any available rock surface, with some images having
      been deliberately made in places that are difficult to reach and to see.  The
      reason for this is unclear, though it has been suggested that such placement
      might be in relation to the images serving a preparatory function for shamans
      preparing to enter a trance.  Some of the engravings have exaggerated features
      such as elongated limbs and extremities which may reflect trance experience.
      \ One of the engravings appears to depict a lion with pugmarks (paw prints)
      instead of feet and third at the end of the tail.  Each of those in the feet
      have five instead of the correct four pads and this has been interpreted as
      meaning that the figure represents a human shaman in trance who has taken on
      lion form.  A similar suggestion has been made regarding the frequent depictions
      of ostriches (Kinahan, 2006).  \n\n¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to
      describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern
      Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions. Both 'San' and 'Bushmen'
      are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others
      have positively adopted them.\n"

    body: "Such interpretations are made on the basis that the artists followed the
      same cultural tradition as the ancestral San|Bushman. The few examples of painted
      rock art at the site certainly appear to conform to the hunter-gatherer tradition
      found elsewhere in Namibia.   Following this approach, the geometric engraved
      forms may be interpreted as illustrative of so-called ‘entoptic’ phenomena:
      shapes and patterns observed when entering a trance state, though an alternative
      origin for some of the geometrics with particular line and circle motifs has
      also been suggested. This proposal suggests that they were made by ancestral
      Khoenkhoen herder people, rather than hunter-gatherers, perhaps in relation
      to initiation practices.  \n\nAttempting to date or sequence the images based
      on superimpositioning or patina is difficult – superimposition of engravings
      at the site is rare and a range of patination colours seem to indicate these
      works having been created over a wide timescale, though it has been noted that
      a certain style of spoor images sometimes overlie some of the animal figures,
      indicating that this is a younger tradition.  Archaeological fieldwork around
      the site undertaken in 1968 by Erich Wendt recovered evidence of occupation
      including stone tools, worked ostrich eggshell and stone structures.  The dates
      recovered from radiocarbon dating ranged widely from c.5,850-180 BP (years before
      present).  The relationship between periods of occupation/site use and the production
      of rock art is not known, but based on archaeological evidence from around the
      wider area it is thought that engravings in the styles found at Twyfelfontein
      range from around 6,000 to around 1,000 years old, though some may be more recent.\n"

      The rock art of Eastern Africa is characterised by a wide range of non-figurative images, broadly defined as geometric. Occurring in a number of different patterns or designs, they are thought to have been in existence in this region for thousands of years, although often it is difficult to attribute the art to particular cultural groups. Geometric rock art is difficult to interpret, and designs have been variously associated with sympathetic magic, symbols of climate or fertility and altered states of consciousness (Coulson and Campbell, 2010:220). However, in some cases the motifs painted or engraved on the rock face resemble the same designs used for branding livestock and are intimately related to people’s lives and world views in this region.

      First observed in Kenya in the 1970s with the work of Gramly (1975) at Lukenya Hill and Lynch and Robbins (1977) at Namoratung’a, some geometric motifs seen in the rock art of the region were observed to have had their counterparts on the hides of cattle of local communities. Although cattle branding is known to be  practised by several Kenyan groups, Gramly concluded that  “drawing cattle brands on the walls of rock shelters appears to be confined to the regions formerly inhabited by the Maa-speaking pastoralists or presently occupied by them”&dagger;(Gramly, 1977:117).

    body: In the case of Lukenya Hill, the rock shelters on whose walls these geometric
      symbols occur are associated with meat-feasting ceremonies. Meat-feasting shelters
      exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are places where
      Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat in their homes,
      gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle. During or after feasting,
      symbols of the animals that had been eaten were painted on the shelter ceiling
      in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand their cattle and camels with
      symbols that signify the lineage of their owners, but may also indicate if an
      animal has been treated for a particular disease. Different symbols may be used
      for male and female animals.

    body: The sites of Namoratung’a near Lake Turkana in northern Kenya showed a similar
      visible relationship. The southernmost site is well known for its 167 megalithic
      stones marking male burials on which are engraved hundreds of geometric motifs.
      Some of these motifs bear a striking resemblance to the brand marks that the
      Turkana mark on their cattle, camels, donkeys and other livestock in the area,
      although local people claim no authorship for the funerary engravings (Russell,
      2013:4).

    body: Recent research (Russell, 2013) has shown that at Namoratung’a the branding
      of animals signifies a sense of belonging rather than a mark of ownership as
      we understand it in a modern farming context; all livestock, cattle, camel,
      goats, sheep and donkeys are branded according to species and sex (Russell,
      2013:7). Ethnographic accounts document that clan membership can only be determined
      by observing someone with their livestock (Russell, 2013:9). The symbol itself
      is not as important as the act of placing it on the animal’s skin, and local
      people have confirmed that they never mark rock with brand marks. Thus, the
      geometric motifs on the grave markers may have been borrowed by local Turkana
      to serve as identity markers, but in a different context. In the Horn of Africa,
      some geometric rock art is located in the open landscape and on graves. It has
      been suggested that these too are brand or clan marks, possibly made by camel
      keeping pastoralists to mark achievement, territory or ownership (Russell, 2013:18).
      Some nomadic pastoralists, further afield, such as the Tuareg, place their clan
      marks along the routes they travel, carved onto salt blocks, trees and wells
      (Mohamed, 1990; Landais, 2001).

    body: "However, not all pastoralist geometric motifs can be associated with meat-feasting
      or livestock branding; they may have wider symbolism or be symbolic of something
      else (Russell, 2013:17).  For example, informants from the Samburu people reported
      that while some of the painted motifs found at Samburu meat-feasting shelters
      were of cattle brands, others represented female headdresses or were made to
      mark an initiation, and in some Masai shelters there are also clear representations
      of warriors’ shields.  In Uganda, a ceremonial rock in Karamoja, shows a dung
      painting consisting of large circles bisected by a cross which is said to represent
      cattle enclosures (Robbins, 1972). Geometric symbols, painted in fat and red
      ochre, on large phallic-shaped fertility stones on the Mesakin and Korongo Hills
      in south Sudan indicate the sex of the child to whom prayers are offered (Bell,
      1936). A circle bisected by a line or circles bisected by two crosses represent
      boys. Girls are represented by a cross (drawn diagonally) or a slanting line
      (like a forward slash)(Russell, 2013: 17).\n\nAlthough pastoralist geometric
      motifs are widespread in the rock art of eastern Africa, attempting to find
      the meaning behind geometric designs is problematic. The examples discussed
      here demonstrate that motifs can have multiple authors, even in the same location,
      and that identical symbols can be the products of very different behaviours.

      These inscriptions, generically named Libyco-Berber, are found from the west
      of Egypt to the Canary Islands and from the Mediterranean Sea to the Sahel countries
      to the south. Together with Egyptian hieroglyphs, they show us one of the earliest
      written languages in Africa and represent a most interesting and challenging
      topic in North African history. They appear in two different formats: engraved
      on *stelae* (mainly on the Mediterranean coast and its hinterland) or on rock
      faces, either isolated or alongside rock art paintings or engravings of the
      later periods of rock art.'

    body: Libyco-Berber characters were identified as written language as early as
      the 17th century, when some inscriptions in the language were documented in
      the Roman city of Dougga (Tunisia). They were deciphered by F. de Saulcy in
      1843 through the comparison of personal names with equivalent Punic names in
      bilingual scenes, although a few characters still remain uncertain. Since the
      beginning of the 19th century onwards different many proposals have been made
      to explain the origin, expansion and translation of these alphabets. There are
      three main explanations of its origin; the most accepted theory considers that
      the Libyco-Berber alphabet and principles of writing were borrowed from the
      Phoenician script, with other symbols added locally.

    body: A second, recent proposal has defended an indigenous (autochthonous) origin
      deriving from a stock of ancient signs –tribal tattoos, marks of ownership,
      or even geometric rock art- which could have resulted in the creation of the
      alphabet. Finally, a mixture of both theories accepts the borrowing of the idea
      of script and some Phoenician signs, which would be complemented with indigenous
      symbols. Although none of these theories can be fully accepted or refuted at
      the present moment, the proposal of a Phoenician borrowing has a wider support

    body: 'The study of Libyco-Berber script faces some huge challenges. In addition
      to its aforementioned variability, it is necessary to differentiate the ancient
      languages spoken and written in North Africa during the Classical Antiquity
      for which a generic term of Libyco-Berber is used. Furthermore, Tifinagh script,
      the modern script of Tuareg people shares some symbols with the Libyco-Berber
      alphabet, but otherwise is a quite different language. Contemporary Tuareg cannot
      understand the old Libyco-Berber inscriptions although they recognize some symbols.
      Chronology represents another challenge: although the first dated inscription
      on a *stela* is from 138 BC, some pottery sherds with Libyco-Berber symbols
      could date from the 3rd century BC. For some researchers the oldest date (as
      old as the 7th century BC) is believed to correspond to an engraving located
      in the Moroccan High Atlas, although that theory is still under discussion.
      Finally, the characteristics of the scripts present some problems: they are
      usually short, repetitive and in many cases incomplete. Moreover, Libyco-Berber
      can be written in different directions (from right to left, bottom to top),
      complicating the identification, transcription and translation of the inscriptions. '

    body: Considering all these problems, what do we know about Libyco-Berber scripts?
      First of all, they normally used only consonants, although due to the influence
      of Punic (the language used in areas controlled or influenced by Carthage) and
      Latin, vowels were added in some alphabet variants. The translation of Libyco-Berber
      scripts is complicated, since the existing texts are very short and can only
      be translated through comparison with equivalent texts in Punic or Latin. Most
      of the translated scripts are very simple and correspond to personal and site
      names, or fixed formulations as “X son of Y”, characteristics of funerary epigraphy,
      or others such as, “It’s me, X”.  Perhaps surprisingly, some of the translated
      inscriptions have an amorous meaning, with expressions as “I, X, love Y”. As
      the known Libyco-Berber corpus of inscriptions grows, it seems possible that
      more and more inscriptions will be translated, leading to a better understanding
      of the languages.

      is still going on about the chronologies and rhythms of this process. After
      the adoption and development of the alphabet, the Libyco-Berber reached a consideration
      of “official language” in the Numidian kingdom, which flourished in the north-western
      coast of Africa during the two latest centuries BC. The kingdom was highly influenced
      by Carthage and Rome, resulting in the existence of bilingual inscriptions that
      were the key to the translation of Libyco-Berber scripts. After Roman conquest,
      Libyco-Berber was progressively abandoned as a written language in the area,
      but inscriptions in the Sahara were still common until an unknown moment in
      the first millennium BC (the scripts sometimes receiving the name of Tifinagh).
      The Berber language, however, has been preserved and a new alphabet was developed
      in the 1960s to be used by Berber people.

    body: Undoubtedly, the deciphering of forgotten languages captures the imagination
      and is one of the most exciting challenges in the study of ancient cultures.
      However, it is usually a difficult enterprise, as extraordinary finds which
      aid translation such as the Rosetta Stone are fairly exceptional and most of
      the time the transcription and translation of these languages is a long and
      difficult process in which the meaning of words and grammar rules is slowly
      unravelled. Although there are no shortcuts to this method, there are some initiatives
      that help to ease the task. One of them is making available catalogues of high
      quality images of inscriptions which can be studied and analysed by specialists.
      In that sense, the Libyco-Berber inscriptions present in the Rock Art Image
      Project catalogue can be truly helpful for all those interested in one of the
      most fascinating languages in the world; a language, which albeit modified  has
      endured in different forms for hundreds of years.

    body: Ethiopia is home to some of the most impressive archaeological remains in
      Africa, such as the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela, the Axumite kingdom monoliths
      or the Gondar palaces. Most of these sites are located in northern Ethiopia,
      but to the south of the country there are also some remarkable archaeological
      remains, less well-known but which deserve attention. One of them is the dozens
      of graveyards located along the Rift valley and marked by hundreds of stone
      stelae of different types, usually decorated. Ethiopia holds the biggest concentration
      of steale in all Africa, a testimony of the complexity of the societies which
      inhabited the Horn of Africa at the beginning of the second millennium AD.

    body: Although some of the most impressive stelae are located to the north-east
      of Ethiopia, in the region where the Axumite Kingdom flourished between the
      1st and the 10th centuries AD, the area with the highest concentration of stelae
      is to the south-west of the country, from the Manz region to the north of Addis
      Ababa to the border with Kenya. It is a extensive area which approximately follows
      the Rift Valley and the series of lakes that occupy its floor, and which roughly
      covers the Soddo, Wolayta and Sidamo regions. The region has a tropical climate
      and is fertile, with warm conditions being predominant and rainfall being quite
      abundant, with annual rates of 1200-1500 mm in the lower areas while in the
      highlands the rainfall reaches 2.000 mm per year.

    body: 'Ethiopian stelae have been known to western scholars since the end of the
      19th century, with the first examples documented in 1885 to the north of Addis
      Ababa and the news about the main group to the south arriving in 1905. The first
      archaeological works in the southern area took place in the 1920’s carried on
      by French and German researchers. The work of Père Azaïs was especially remarkable,
      with four expeditions undertaken between 1922 and 1926 which were partially
      published in 1931. Along with Azaïs, a German team from the Frobénius Institute
      started to study the site of Tuto Fela, a huge cemetery with hundreds of phallic
      and anthropomorphic stelae located in the Sidamo region. Since these early studies
      the archaeological remains were left unattended until the 1970’s, when Francis
      Anfray excavated the site of Gattira-Demma and organized a far more systematic
      survey in the area which documented dozens of stelae of different sizes and
      types. In the 1980’s, another French team started to study first Tiya and then
      Tuto Fela and another important site, Chelba-Tutitti, in a long-term project
      which has been going on for thirty years and has been paramount to understand
      the types, chronologies and distribution of these archaeological remains. The
      historical importance of these stelae was universally recognized in 1980, when
      Tiya was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. '

    title_internal: 'Stela: thematic, chapter 4'
    body: 'The Ethiopian stelae show a great variability in shapes and decorations,
      but at least three main groups could be defined. The first corresponds to the
      so-called phallic stelae, long cylindrical stones with a hemispherical top delimited
      by a groove or ring (Jossaume 2012: 97). The body of the stela is sometimes
      decorated with simple geometric patterns. A second type is known as anthropomorphic,
      with the top of the piece carved to represent a face and the rest of the piece
      decorated with crossed patterns. These two types are common to the east of the
      Rift Valley lakes, while to the south of Addis Ababa and to the west of these
      lakes several other types are present, most of them representing anthropomorphs
      but sometimes plain instead of cylindrical. These figures are usually classified
      depending on the shape and especially the features engraved on them –masks,
      pendants, swords- with the most lavishly carved considered the most recent.
      Probably the best known group is that with swords represented, such as those
      of Tiya, characterized by plain stones in which groups of swords (up to nineteen)
      are depicted along with dots and other unidentified symbols. Not all the stelae
      have these weapons, although those that don’t are otherwise identical in shape
      and have other common signs engraved on them.  Regarding their chronology the
      Ethiopian stela seem to be relatively new, dated from the 10th to the 13th centuries,
      sometimes with one type of stela superimposed on another and in other cases
      with old types being reused in later tombs.'

    body: 'Regardless of their chronology and shape, most of the stela seem to have
      a funerary function, marking the tombs of deceased which were buried in cemeteries
      sometimes reaching hundreds of graves. The information collected from sites
      of such as Tuto Fela show that not all the burials had an attached stela, and
      considering the amount of work necessary to prepare them those which had could
      be interpreted as belonging to high status people. In some cases, such as in
      Tiya, it seems evident that the stela marked the graves of important personalities
      within their communities. It is difficult to determine who the groups that carved
      these stelae were, but given their chronology it seems that they could have
      been Cushitic or Nilotic-speaking pastoralist communities absorbed by the Oromo
      expansion that took place in the sixteenth century. A lot of research has still
      to be done about these graveyards and their associated living spaces, and undoubtedly
      many groups of stelae are yet to be discovered. Those studied show, however,
      the potential interest of ancient communities still poorly known but which were
      able to develop complex societies and these material expressions of authority
      and power. '

    body: 'If we were to choose a defining image for the Sahara Desert, it would probably
      depict an endless sea of yellow dunes under a blue sky and, off in the distance,
      a line of long-legged, humped animals whose profiles have become synonymous
      with deserts: the one-humped camel (or dromedary). Since its domestication,
      the camel’s resistance to heat and its ability to survive with small amounts
      of water and a diet of desert vegetation have made it a key animal for inhabitants
      of the Sahara, deeply bound to their economy, material culture and lifestyle.'

    body: Yet, surprising as it seems, the camel is a relative newcomer to the Sahara
      – at least when compared to other domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, horses
      and donkeys. Although the process is not yet fully known, camels were domesticated
      in the Arabian Peninsula around the third millennium BC, and spread from there
      to the Middle East, North Africa and Somalia from the 1st century AD onwards.
      The steps of this process from Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean have been documented
      through many different historical sources, from Roman texts to sculptures or
      coins, but it is especially relevant in Saharan rock art, where camels became
      so abundant that they have given their name to a whole period. The depictions
      of camels provide an incredible amount of information about the life, culture
      and economy of the Berber and other nomadic communities from the beginnings
      of the Christian era to the Muslim conquest in the late years of the 7th century.

    body: 'What is it that makes camels so suited to deserts? It is not only their
      ability to transform the fat stored in their hump into water and energy, or
      their capacity to eat thorny bushes, acacia leaves and even fish and bones.
      Camels are also able to avoid perspiration by manipulating their core temperature,
      enduring fluctuations of up to six degrees that could be fatal for other mammals.
      They rehydrate very quickly, and some of their physical features (nostrils,
      eyebrows) have adapted to increase water conservation and protect the animals
      from dust and sand. All these capacities make camels uniquely suited to hot
      climates: in temperatures of 30-40 °C, they can spend up to 15 days without
      water. In addition, they are large animals, able to carry loads of up to 300kg,
      over long journeys across harsh environments. The pads on their feet have evolved
      so as to prevent them from sinking into the sand. It is not surprising that
      dromedaries are considered the ‘ships of the desert’, transporting people, commodities
      and goods through the vast territories of the Sahara.'

    body: As mentioned previously, camels came from the Arabian Peninsula through
      Egypt, where bone remains have been dated to the early 1st millennium BC. However,
      it took hundreds of years to move into the rest of North Africa due to the River
      Nile, which represented a major geographical and climatic barrier for these
      animals. The expansion began around the beginning of the Christian era, and
      probably took place both along the Mediterranean Sea and through the south of
      the Sahara. At this stage, it appears to have been very rapid, and during the
      following centuries camels became a key element in the North African societies.
      They were used mainly for riding, but also for transporting heavy goods and
      even for ploughing. Their milk, hair and meat were also used, improving the
      range of resources available to their herders. However, it seems that the large
      caravans that crossed the desert searching for gold, ivory or slaves came later,
      when the Muslim conquest of North Africa favoured the establishment of vast
      trade networks with the Sahel, the semi-arid region that lies south of the Sahara.

    body: Rock art can be extremely helpful in learning about the different ways in
      which camels were used in the first millennium AD. Images of camels are found
      in both engravings and paintings in red, white or – on rare occasions – black;
      sometimes the colours are combined to achieve a more impressive effect. They
      usually appear in groups, alongside humans, cattle and, occasionally, dogs and
      horses. Sometimes, even palm trees and houses are included to represent the
      oases where the animals were watered. Several of the scenes show female camels
      herded or taking care of their calves, showing the importance of camel-herding
      and breeding for the Libyan-Berber communities.

      That camels were used to transport goods is obvious, and depictions of long lines of animals are common, sometimes with saddles on which to place the packs and ropes to tie the animals together. However, if rock art depictions are some indication of camel use, it seems that until the Muslim conquest the main function of one-humped camels was as mounts, often linked to war. The Sahara desert contains dozens of astonishingly detailed images of warriors riding camels, armed with spears, long swords and shields, sometimes accompanied by infantry soldiers and horsemen. Although camels are not as good as horses for use as war mounts (they are too tall and make insecure platforms for shooting arrows), they were undoubtedly very useful in raids – the most common type of war activity in the desert – as well as being a symbol of prestige, wealth and authority among the desert warriors, much as they still are today.

      Moreover, the extraordinary detail of some of the rock art paintings has provided inestimable help in understanding how (and why) camels were ridden in the 1st millennium AD. Unlike horses, donkeys or mules, one-humped camels present a major problem for riders: where to put the saddle. Although it might be assumed that the saddle should be placed over the hump, they can, in fact, also be positioned behind or in front of the hump, depending on the activity. It seems that the first saddles were placed behind the hump, but that position was unsuitable for fighting, quite uncomfortable, and unstable. Subsequently, a new saddle was invented in North Arabia around the 5th century BC: a framework of wood that rested over the hump and provided a stable platform on which to ride and fight more effectively. The North Arabian saddle led to a revolution in the domestication of one-humped camels, allowed a faster expansion of the use of these animals, and it is probably still the most used type of saddle today.

    body: 'Although North Arabian saddles are found throughout North Africa and are
      often depicted in rock art paintings, at some point a new kind of saddle was
      designed in North Africa: one placed in front of the hump, with the weight over
      the shoulders of the camel. This type of shoulder saddle allows the rider to
      control the camel with the feet and legs, thus improving the ride. Moreover,
      the rider is seated in a lower position and thus needs shorter spears and swords
      that can be brandished more easily, making warriors more efficient. This new
      kind of saddle, which is still used throughout North Africa today, appears only
      in the western half of the Sahara and is well represented in the rock art of
      Algeria, Niger and Mauritania. And it is not only saddles that are recognizable
      in Saharan rock art: harnesses, reins, whips or blankets are identifiable in
      the paintings and show astonishing similarities to those still used today by
      desert peoples.'

    title_internal: 'Camels: thematic, chapter 8'
    body: Since their introduction to the Sahara during the first centuries of the
      Christian era, camels have become indispensable for desert communities, providing
      a method of transport for people and commodities, but also for their milk, meat
      and hair for weaving. They allowed the improvement of wide cultural and economic
      networks, transforming the Sahara into a key node linking the Mediterranean
      Sea with Sub-Saharan Africa. A symbol of wealth and prestige, the Libyan-Berber
      peoples recognized camels’ importance and expressed it through paintings and
      engravings across the desert, leaving a wonderful document of their societies.
      The painted images of camel-riders crossing the desert not only have an evocative
      presence, they are also perfect snapshots of a history that started two thousand
      years ago and seems as eternal as the Sahara.

    title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 1'
    body: Fishing is an ancient practice in Africa, dating back 100,000 years, when
      modern humans started moving into coastal environments. The remains of thousands
      of fish bones and shellfish from sites on the southern African coastline dating
      to the Middle Stone Age testify to its antiquity. At the same time that human
      populations in Africa were developing more sophisticated terrestrial hunting
      technologies, they were also acquiring innovative and productive fishing and
      riverine hunting skills. Concomitantly, marine shells were being collected to
      thread on to twine, probably for use as items of personal ornamentation. Archaeological
      research has shown that aquatic environments have been exploited for both subsistence
      and cultural purposes for tens of thousands of years.

    title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 2'
    body: |-
      We rarely consider the Sahara as the optimum environment for fishing. Seeing painted and engraved images of fish located in these waterless and unfavourable landscapes therefore seems at odds with our present-day knowledge of this vast desert. However, as we have noted before in these project pages (see introductions to Libya and Algeria), water-dependent animals such as crocodile and hippo have regularly been depicted in Saharan rock art, illustrating a once wetter and more fertile landscape. To date, the African rock art image project has catalogued representations of aquatic species in Libya, Algeria and Morocco, depicted with varying degrees of proficiency and ease of identification. This has been an insightful encounter, because it not only informs our thinking about the nature of the environment in the past and the way people were using their available resources, but also allows us to think about the cultural importance of water-based species.

      The rock art in these places is a glimpse into an aquatic past that is now supported by environmental evidence. In a recent collaborative project mapping ancient watercourses in the Sahara, it has been shown that during the Holocene (a period which started around 11,700 years ago), this now arid landscape was once covered by a dense interconnected river system, as well as large bodies of water known as ‘megalakes’. When these lakes overflowed, they linked catchment areas, resulting in a dense palaeoriver network that allowed water-dependent life (fish, molluscs and amphibians) to migrate and disperse across an extensive landscape. This interlinked waterway of the Sahara formed a single and vast biogeographic area. Perhaps not surprisingly, rock art sites appear to be clustered around inland deltas where resources would have been most plentiful.

      Across the Sahara, at least twenty-three species of fish have been identified in archaeological deposits from the Holocene, the most common being Tilapia, Catfish, African jewelfish, Silver fish and Nile perch. But can we go as far as to correlate the archaeological record with the rock art to species level?

    body: Rock art imagery is replete with both very naturalistic representations
      and also those which are more conceptual or abstract in nature, and the depictions
      of fish are no exception. While the representations in Figs. 1 and 2 are clearly
      identifiable (and may depict a Nile perch in the former), that in Fig. 3 is
      more difficult to identify. The vertical red dots on the left of the photograph
      are arranged in a fish-like shape that converges at the top and bottom. Additionally
      it has been deliberately placed on a section of the rock face where there is
      water seepage, blending the art with the natural environment. The dotted pattern
      is reminiscent of the African jewelfish (*Hemichromis letourneauxi*) (Fig. 4)
      or even the Redbelly Tilapia (*Tilapia zillii*) (Fig. 5), both shown to be species
      of fish found throughout much of the Sahara during the Holocene.

    title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 4'
    body: Figs. 6 and 8 show engravings of fish that bear close morphological resemblances
      to Catfish, with even the barbels depicted. Catfish seem to occur more regularly
      in rock art than other species of fish, possibly due to their physical characteristics.
      They possess an auxiliary breathing organ which allows them to inhabit extremely
      de-oxygenated water; in fact, when necessary they can obtain up to 50% of their
      total oxygen requirements from the air. In some cases they will leave the water
      and crawl on dry ground to escape drying pools. This capacity to live in very
      shallow waters and to occupy the liminal spaces between land and water has elevated
      them to more than a simple food source and given them a place of cultural significance
      in many African societies.

    title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 5'
    body: In arid ecosystems, bodies of water are characterised by daily and seasonal
      fluctuations in water temperature, evaporation and other natural phenomena,
      and some fish species have adapted well to cope with these extreme changes in
      water chemistry. Catfish and Tilapia in particular are able to survive high
      salinity, which occurs through evaporation, while Redbelly Tilapia can also
      tolerate temperatures above 35° C. Both Sharptooth Catfish and Tilapia are floodplain
      dwellers and possess the ability to live and spawn in shallow waters, making
      them easily susceptible to predation. Catfish spines were also used to decorate
      Saharan pottery with dotted wavy-line patterns. These biological characteristics,
      which meant they could be easily hunted, may explain their frequent depiction
      in rock art. Perhaps their value was also reinforced by their being (possibly)
      the last fish species to survive once aridification had taken hold in the Sahara.

    title: Fishing
    title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 6'
    body: Fish are likely to have been caught in a variety of ways, but in the Sahara
      the most common technique was to use barbed bone point and/or fish hook technology,
      with the former being the most archaeologically visible. Barbed points may either
      be fixed – that is permanently attached to a spear or arrow shaft – or used
      as ‘harpoons’, when they separate from a shaft on impact and remain attached
      by a line. Barbed points can actually be used to catch multiple types of prey,
      but the primary use across Africa was for fish.

    body: Chronologically, the earliest barbed bone point records are from Katanda
      in the Upper Semliki Valley in modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo,
      dating to 80,000 – 90,000 years ago. Here people were catching Catfish weighing
      up to 68 kg (150 lb), sufficient to feed eighty people for two days. Research
      has noted the distribution of barbed bone points across the Sahara, and the
      correlation between these locations and the distribution of species requiring
      deep water. It is clear that there is continuity in sophisticated fishing technology
      and practice that has lasted tens of thousands of years.

    title: Other aquatic species
    title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 8'
    body: Other aquatic species are more difficult to identify and are much rarer.
      For example, Fig 12a has been interpreted as a jelly-fish like creature. The
      photograph here has been digitally manipulated to enhance the image and on closer
      inspection However, by manipulating the colour and lighting as in Fig. 12b,
      the image is a little clearer and appears to share morphological characteristics
      with a turtle rather than a jellyfish – such as the rounded carapace and small
      flippers – with a turtle rather than a jellyfish. Furthermore, we know that
      softshell turtles (*Trionyx triunguis*) have been found in archaeological deposits
      in the Sahara dating to the Holocene. The vertical and wavy strands hanging
      down underneath could represent the pattern made in the sand by turtles when
      walking rather than being the tendrils of a jellyfish. Moreover, Fig 13 appears
      to resemble a snail and would be consistent with what we know about the Capsian
      culture who inhabited modern Tunisia and Algeria and parts of Libya during the
      early Holocene (10,000–6,000 BC). Their distinguishing culinary feature was
      a fondness for escargots – edible land snails.

    title_internal: 'Thematic: fishing, chapter 9'
    body: A recently excavated cemetery site called Gobero (Fig. 14) (see citation),
      situated on the western edge of the Ténéré desert in Niger, provides a uniquely
      preserved record of human occupation in the Sahara during the Holocene and puts
      into context some of the examples of rock art we have looked at here. Pollen
      analysis has indicated that during the Holocene, Gobero was situated in an open
      savannah landscape of grasses and sedges, with fig trees and tamarisk, where
      permanent water and marshy habitats were present.

      Approximately 200 burials, ranging over a 5000-year period, were found on the edge of an ancient lake. Grave goods include bones or tusks from wild fauna, ceramics, lithic projectile points, and bone, ivory and shell ornaments. One adult male was buried in a recumbent pose seated on the carapace of a mud turtle. Microliths, bone harpoon points and hooks, and ceramics with dotted wavy-line and zigzag impressed motifs were found in the burial fill, in an associated midden area, and in nearby paleolake deposits. Nile perch (*Lates niloticus*), large catfish, and tilapia dominate the midden fauna, which also includes bones and teeth from hippos, several bovids, small carnivores, softshell turtles and crocodiles.

      The early Holocene occupants at Gobero (7700–6300 BC.) were largely sedentary hunter-fisher-gatherers with lakeside funerary sites. Across the ‘green’ Sahara, Catfish, Tilapia and turtles played important roles socially, economically and culturally. We can see this most explicitly in the burial within a turtle carapace in Gobero, but the representation of aquatic animals in rock art is a significant testament to their value.

    title_internal: 'Thematic: chariots, chapter 1'
    body: A number of sites we have been cataloguing recently, located in the Libyan
      Desert, notably the Fezzan region, have included paintings of chariots in a
      variety of forms, dating to the Horse Period, from up to 3,000 years ago. This
      has stimulated some interesting questions about the use of chariots in what
      appears to be such a seemingly inappropriate environment for a wheeled vehicle,
      as well as the nature of representation. Why were chariots used in the desert
      and why were they represented in such different ways?

    title_internal: 'Thematic: chariots, chapter 2'
    body: The chariot has been one of the great empowering innovations of history.
      It likely originated in Mesopotamia about 3000 BC due to advances in metallurgy
      during the Bronze Age, and has served as a primary means of transport until
      quite recently in the historical period across Africa, Eurasia and Europe. Chariots
      provided rapid and efficient transport, and were ideal for the battlefield as
      the design provided a raised firing platform for archers . As a result the chariot
      became the principal war machine from the Egyptians through to the Romans; and
      the Chinese, who owned an army of 10,000 chariots. Indeed, our use of the word
      car is a derivative of the Latin word carrus, meaning ‘a chariot of war or of
      triumph’.

    title_internal: 'Thematic: chariots, chapter 3'
    body: The chariot in the Sahara was probably introduced by the Garamantes, a cultural
      group thought to be descended from Berbers and Saharan pastoralists. There is
      little textual information about the Garamantes, documentation comes mainly
      from Greek and Roman sources. Herodotus described them as ‘a very great nation’.
      Recent archaeological research has shown that the Garamantes established about
      eight major towns as well as numerous other settlements, and were ‘brilliant
      farmers, resourceful engineers, and enterprising merchants’. The success of
      the Garamantes was based on their subterranean water-extraction system, a network
      of underground tunnels, allowing the Garamantian culture to flourish in an increasingly
      arid environment, resulting in population expansion, urbanisation, and conquest.

    title_internal: 'Thematic: chariots, chapter 4'
    body: On average there are about 500 drawings of chariots across the Sahara, from
      the Fezzan in Libya through the Aïr of Niger into northern Mali and then westward
      to the Atlantic coast; but not all were produced by the Garamantes. It is still
      not certain that chariots were driven along the routes where their depictions
      occur; remains of chariots have never been found west of the Fezzan. However,
      the Fezzan states were thriving trade routes and chariots are likely to have
      been used to transport salt, cloth, beads and metal goods in exchange for gold,
      ivory and slaves. The widespread occurrence of chariot imagery on Saharan rock
      outcrops has led to the proposition of ‘chariot routes’ linking North and West
      Africa. However, these vehicles were not suited for long-distance transport
      across desert terrain; more localised use is probable, conducted through middlemen
      who were aware of the trade routes through the desert landscape. Additionally,
      the horse at this time was a prestige animal and it is unlikely that they facilitated
      transport across the Saharan trade routes, with travellers rather utilising
      donkeys or oxen.

    title_internal: 'Thematic: chariots, chapter 5'
    body: The absence of archaeological evidence for chariots has led to the suggestion
      that some representations of chariots may have been the result of cultural diffusion,
      transmitted orally by nomadic peoples traversing the region. Artists may never
      have actually seen the vehicles themselves. If this is the case, chariot symbols
      may have acquired some special meaning above their function as modes of transport.
      It may also explain why some representations of chariots do not seem to conform
      to more conventional styles of representations and account for the different
      ways in which they were depicted.

      Figs. 7 and 8 may or may not depict chariots. The rectangular shape in the top left of Fig. 7 and to the left in Fig. 8 are potentially abstracted forms of the chariot similar to the ‘flattened out’ depictions above in Figs. 5 and 6. The representation in Fig. 7 sits alongside distinguishing figures of the Horse Period when chariots were being used, such as geometric bi-triangular figures, spears or lances, women wearing long dresses, and animals drawn in a fairly naturalistic style.

      Beside the schematic and simply depicted chariots, there is also a group which has been termed the ‘flying gallop chariots’ (Fig.3 above and Fig. 9 below). Their distribution includes the whole Tassili region, although there are fewer in the Acacus Mountains. They resemble the classical two-wheeled antique chariots, generally drawn by two horses, but sometimes three, or even four. The driver is usually alone, and is depicted in a typical style with a stick head. The majority are shown at full speed, with the driver holding a whip standing on a small platform, sometimes straining forward.

      In a similar manner to the schematic chariots, the depictions in Figs. 3 and 9 display the entire platform and both wheels of the chariot. In addition, more than one horse is depicted as a single horse in profile with numerous legs indicating multiple horses; an artistic technique first seen during the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe. Interestingly, in the Libyan rock art of the Acacus Mountains it seemed that animals could be conceived of in profile and in movement, but chariots were conceived of differently, and are represented in plain view, seen from above or in three-quarters perspective.

      Why are chariots depicted in a variety of ways, and what can we say about the nature of representation in relation to chariots? It is clear that chariots are able to be depicted in profile view (Fig. 1), yet there are variations that digress from this perspective. In relation to the few examples we have come across so far in the Acacus Mountains in south-western Libya, one observation we might make is that the ways in which chariots have been represented may be indicative of the ways in which they have been observed by the artists representing them; as a rule from above. The rock shelters in the Acacus are often some height above the now dried up wadis, and so the ways in which they conceived of representing the chariot itself , whether as a flying gallop chariot, a chariot drawn by a bovid or as an abstraction, may have become a particular representational convention. The ways in which animals were represented conformed also to a convention, one that had a longer tradition, but chariots were an innovation and may have been represented as they were observed; from higher up in the rockshelters; thus chariots were conceived of as a whole and from an aerial perspective. The ways in which environments affect our perceptions of dimension, space and colour are now well-established, initially through cross-cultural anthropological studies in the 1960s, and becoming better understood through more recent research concerning the brain. Of course, this is speculation, and further research would be needed to consider all the possibilities. But for now, we can start to see some intriguing lines of enquiry and research areas that these images have stimulated.

    body: Vast trading network across the Sahara Desert not only facilitated the spread
      of goods, but the routes served as a conduit for cultural diffusion through
      the spread of knowledge, ideas and technologies. Chariots were both functional
      and symbolic. As a mode of transport, as a weapon of war, as a means of trade
      and exchange and as a symbol of power, the chariot has been a cultural artefact
      for 4,000 years. Its temporal and spatial reach is evident not only in the rock
      art, but through the British Museum collections, which reveal comparisons between
      2D rock art and 3D artefacts. Similarities and adjacencies occur not only in
      the structure and design of the chariots themselves but in their symbolic and
      pragmatic nature (Figs. 10–14).

    body: Hair is a global form of social communication. Among numerous social groups
      throughout Africa, hairstyling and hairdressing hold great cultural and aesthetic
      significance. Coiffures have been regarded as indicative of ethnic origin, gender
      and stages of life development – as well as simply fashion – and have been related
      to power, age, religion and politics. The transitory yet highly visible nature
      of hair ensures its suitability as a medium for personal and social expression.
      And it is not just the domain of women; elaborate hair-styling for men can be
      an equally important indicator of their place in society.

    body: |-
      We have recently documented a particularly interesting set of images from Uan Amil, at Wadi Teshuinat in the Acacus Mountains, south-western Libya, which reflect the cultural significance of hair in African societies. The scenes depict groups of people engaged in a variety of communal social practices wearing elaborate coiffures (Fig. 1), together with some very discrete moments of personal hairdressing.

      The image below (Fig. 2), which is part of a larger panel (Fig. 3), shows an intimate moment between two persons, an individual with an ornate coiffure washing or attending to the hair of another. In some African societies, a person’s choice of hairdresser is dictated by their relationship to them. It is most often the work of friends or family to whom you entrust your hair. In the hands of a stranger or adversary hair can be used as an ingredient in the production a powerful substance that could afflict its owner; such is the potency of hair. This image well conveys such intimacy.

    body: 'The rock shelter of Uan Amil was discovered in 1957 by the Italian-Libyan
      Joint Archaeological Mission surveying in the Acacus and Messak regions of Libya.
      Excavations have indicated the shelter was in use over a long period, with at
      least three main occupational phases between the 8th and 4th millennium BP.
      Italian archaeologist Fabrizio Mori has dated these paintings to 6,000 years
      ago, while David Coulson has been more cautious and has suggested that the presence
      of a metal blade on the arrow head seen at the bottom of this image may indicate
      a more recent age. Notwithstanding the problems associated with the dating of
      rock art, the subject matter is intriguing. It has been suggested that today’s
      Wodaabe nomads of Niger resemble the people on these rock paintings: ‘the cattle
      look the same, as do the campsites with their calf-ropes, and the women’s hairstyles
      with the special bun on the forehead. The female hair bun is big and round like
      a globe.’ (Bovin, 2001:12).'

      The Wodaabe number around 125,000. As pastoral nomads they migrate often and over large geographical areas, keeping mahogany-coloured Zebu cattle which have a hump on their back and long horns, shaped like a lyre. As a cultural group they have attracted much anthropological attention because of their traditional values of beauty (in particular the male beauty pageant) which pervades their everyday lives and practices.

      Wodaabe seldom wash their entire bodies mainly because of the scarcity of water. Water from wells is mainly used for drinking by humans and animals. Washing the body and clothes is less of a priority; and hair is hardly ever washed. When Wodaabe put rancid butter on their hair it is to make it soft and shiny and cleanse it of dust and lice. To them rancid butter gives a nice sweet smell (Bovin, 2011: 56). Fig. 2 shows a vessel sitting between the two individuals that may have served to hold rancid butter used in the preparation of the hair; in fact, treating the hair with butter is a widespread practice in African societies. In addition, Wodaabe never cut their hair; everybody (men and women alike) want to have hair as long as possible, as represented in Figs. 2 and 5. The ideal girl should have long, thick, black hair, enough to make a huge round bun on her forehead, while the ideal young male should have long, thick black hair to make braids to the shoulders.

    body: |-
      A long, narrow face is also admired and this is enhanced by shaping the hair on top of the head, and also using an ostrich feather to elongate the face (Bovin, 2001:26). The painting in Fig. 4, also from Wadi Teshuinat, characterises this.

      Interestingly, the coiffures in Figs. 1, 2 and 3 are light in colour and do not conform to the black ideal as indicated above. It has been suggested that this represents Caucasians with blonde hair. However, it may also be a visual strategy to emphasise the aesthetics of the coiffure. Hairstyles in African sculpture are often shown conceptually, rather than mimetically; idealising rather than copying exactly from contemporary hairdressing practices. In this respect representation follows artistic traditions as much as, or more than, it responds to ephemeral shifts in fashion.

    body: The importance of hair styling and its importance in social practices are
      evident in Figs. 3 and 6 where hair-washing, hairstyling or hair preparation
      is an active element within more complex social and cultural activities. Fig.
      3 has been interpreted as showing preparations for a wedding, while Fig. 5/6
      is understood as a scene of supplication, with people visiting a man in a curved
      shelter; it may even be a representation of the cave. In addition, the C-shaped
      feature has been suggested to be a coiled snake and the figure sits between
      the head and tail. It may seem incongruous to have hair preparation scenes represented
      within a tableau representing a wedding or ceremonial meeting, but may say something
      more about the nature of representation. In each case, these may represent a
      conceptual depiction of time and space. These activities are not ones that occur
      concurrently temporally and spatially, but rather represent an assemblage of
      discrete moments that contribute to each ceremony in its entirety.

    body: The Wodaabe invest vast amounts of time and resources in their outward appearance
      and the need to beautify and refine. ‘Art’ is not just something that is aesthetically
      pleasing; it is a necessity of life, a necessity that must be exhibited. While
      there are likely to be a variety of complex social, economic and cultural motivations,
      that necessity is possibly additionally driven or fuelled by a seemingly desolate,
      unadorned, irregular landscape. The importance lies in distinguishing oneself
      as a cultural being rather than the ‘uncultured other’, such as an animal; and
      hair is an apposite medium by which to make this nature/culture distinction.
      Hair care in African societies is unmistakably aesthetic in its aspirations
      as it gets transferred into other artistic mediums, and the divide between nature
      and culture is thoroughly and intentionally in play. To transform hair is to
      transform nature, and is truly an artistic discipline.

    title: Horses and chariots
    title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 2'
    body: The first introduction of the domestic horse to Ancient Egypt- and thereby
      to Africa- is usually cited at around 1,600 BC, linked with the arrival in Egypt
      of the Hyksos, a group from the Levant who ruled much of Northern Egypt during
      the Second Intermediate Period. By this point, horses had probably only been
      domesticated for about 2,000 years, but with the advent of the chariot after
      the 3rd millennium BC in Mesopotamia, the horse proved to be a valuable martial
      asset in the ancient world. One of the first clear records of the use of horses
      and chariots in battle in Africa is found in depictions from the mortuary complex
      of the Pharaoh Ahmose at Abydos from around 1,525 BC, showing their use by Egyptians
      in defeating the Hyksos, and horses feature prominently in later Egyptian art.

    body: 'Some of the most renowned images of horses in Saharan rock art are also
      those of chariot teams: in particular, those of the so-called ‘flying gallop’
      style chariot pictures, from the Tassili n’Ajjer and Acacus mountains in modern
      Algeria and Libya. These distinctive images are characterised by depictions
      of one or more horses pulling a chariot with their legs outstretched in a stylised
      manner and are sometimes attributed to the Garamantes, a group who were a local
      power in the central Sahara from about 500 BC-700 AD. But the Ajjer Plateau
      is over a thousand miles from the Nile- how and when did the horse and chariot
      first make their way across the Western Desert to the rest of North Africa in
      the first place? Egyptian accounts indicate that by the 11th century BC Libyans
      (people living on the north African coast around the border of modern Egypt
      and Libya) were using chariots in war. Classical sources later write about the
      chariots of the Garamantes and of chariot use by peoples of the far western
      Sahara continuing into the 1st century BC, by which time the chariot horse had
      largely been eclipsed in war by the cavalry mount.'

      are also numerous paintings and engravings across northern Africa of people
      riding horses. Riding may have been practiced since the earliest times of horse
      domestication, though the earliest definitive depictions of horses being ridden
      come from the Middle East in the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia BC. Images
      of horses and riders in rock art occur in various areas of Morocco, Egypt and
      Sudan and are particularly notable in the Ennedi region of Chad and the Adrar
      and Tagant plateaus in Mauritania (interestingly, however, no definite images
      of horses are known in the Gilf Kebir/Jebel Uweinat area at the border of Egypt,
      Sudan and Libya).

    title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 5'
    body: Traditional chronologies for Saharan rock art areas tend to place depictions
      of ridden horses chronologically after those of horses and chariots, and in
      general use horse depictions to categorise regional stylistic periods of rock
      art according to broad date boundaries. As such, in most places, the ‘horse’
      rock art period is usually said to cover about a thousand years from the end
      of the 2nd millennium BC. It is then considered to be succeeded by a ‘camel’
      period, where the appearance of images of dromedaries – known only to have been
      introduced to the eastern Sahara from Arabia at the end of the 1st century BC
      – reflects the next momentous influx of a beast of burden to the area and thus
      a new dating parameter (read more about depictions of camels in the Sahara).
      However, such simplistic categorisation can be misleading. For one thing, although
      mounting horses certainly gained popularity over driving them, it is not always
      clear that depictions of ridden horses are not contemporary with those of chariots.
      Further, the horse remained an important martial tool after the use of war-chariots
      declined. Even after the introduction of the camel, there are several apparently
      contemporary depictions featuring both horse and camel riders.

    title: Berber Horses
    title_internal: 'Thematic: horse, chapter 6'
    body: As the more manoeuvrable rider rose in popularity against the chariot as
      a weapon of war, historical reports from classical authors like Strabo tell
      us of the prowess of African horsemen such as the cavalry of the Numidians,
      a Berber group that allied with Carthage against the Romans in the 3rd century
      BC. Berber peoples would remain heavily associated with horse breeding and riding,
      and the later rock art of Mauritania has been attributed to Berber horsemen,
      or the sight of them. Although horses may already have reached the areas of
      modern Mauritania and Mali by this point, archaeological evidence does not confirm
      their presence in these south-westerly regions of the Sahara until much later,
      in the mid-1st millennium AD, and it has been suggested that some of the horse
      paintings in Mauritania may be as recent as 16th century.

      Indeed, discernible images of such accoutrements in Saharan rock art can help

    body: 'Another intriguing possibility is that of gaining clues on the origins
      of modern horse breeds from rock art, in particular the ancient Barb breed native
      to the Maghreb, where it is still bred. Ancient Mesopotamian horses were generally
      depicted as heavily-built, and It has been suggested that the basic type for
      the delicate Arabian horse, with its dished (concave) facial profile and high-set
      tail, may have been developed in north-east Africa prior to its subsequent appearance
      and cultivation in Arabia, and that these features may be observed in Ancient
      Egyptian images from the New Kingdom. Likewise, there is the possibility that
      some of the more naturalistic paintings from the central Sahara show the similarly
      gracile features of the progenitors of the Barb, distinguishable from the Arab
      by its straight profile and low-set tail. Like the Arab, the Barb is a desert
      horse: hardy, sure-footed and able to withstand great heat; it is recognised
      as an ancient breed with an important genetic legacy, both in the ancestry of
      the Iberian horses later used throughout the Americas, and that of the modern
      racing thoroughbred.'

      alone, especially given the gulf of time that has elapsed and the relative paucity

      depictions throughout northern Africa, with some forms highly schematic. This
      variation is not only in style – and, as previously noted, in time period and
      geography – but also in context, as of course images of one subject cannot be
      divorced from the other images around them, on whichever surface has been chosen,
      and are integral to these surroundings.

      symbolism and implied value of the horse image in different cultural contexts.
      Where some Tassilian horses are delicately painted in lifelike detail, the stockier
      images of horses associated with the so-called ‘Libyan Warrior’ style petroglyphs
      of the Aïr mountains and Adrar des Ifoghas in Niger and Mali appear more as
      symbolic accoutrements to the central human figures and tend not to be shown
      as ridden. By contrast, there are paintings in the Ennedi plateau of Chad where
      galloping horse figures have clearly been painted over existing walking human
      figures to make them appear as if riding.

      In each of these cases, the original symbolic intent of the artists have been lost to time, but with these horse depictions, as with so much African rock art imagery, there is great scope for further future analysis. Particularly intriguing, for example, are the striking stylistic similarities in horse depictions across great distances, such the horse depictions with bi-triangular bodies (e.g. figs 5 &13), or with fishbone-style tails which may be found almost two thousand miles apart in Chad and Mauritania.

      Whatever the myriad circumstances and significances of the images, it is clear that following its introduction to the continent, the hardy and surefooted desert horse’s usefulness for draught, transport and fighting purposes transformed the societies which used it and gave it a powerful symbolic value.

      Historically, much of the rock art from across northern Africa has been classified according to a particular style or ‘school’ of depictions. One such category of images, known as the Libyan Warrior School or Libyan Warrior style is found predominantly in Niger. Typically, this style

      “…commonly depicts human figures, mainly armed warriors; women are very rare. The style is fairly crude and the technique unsophisticated, almost invariably a rather careless pecking. The figures, almost always presented frontally with their heads quite circular, with added lobes, or mushroom-shaped, are shown according to a symmetrical schema. Various garment decorations and feathers in the hair are common, and the warrior often holds one or two throwing-spears – the bow is almost lacking – and frequently also holds by the leading rein a typical horse; foreshortened with large hindquarters” (Muzzolini, 2001:614)

      Termed *Libyan Warriors* by French ethnographer Henri Lhote, these representations have been associated with Garamantes’ raids, possibly 2,500 years ago. Thought to be descended from Berbers and Saharan pastoralists who settled in central Libya from around 1500 BC, the Garamantes developed a thriving urban centre, with flourishing trade networks from Libya to Niger. In contrast, Francis Rodd, a military man who led two big expeditions to the Sahara in the 1920s, proposed that these figures represent Tuareg; a people reputedly of Berber descent who live a nomadic pastoralist lifestyle. They have their own script known as Tifinagh, which is thought to have Libyan roots and which is engraved onto rocks alongside other rock art depictions.

      Libyan Warrior figures are almost exclusively located in the Aïr Mountains of Niger although can also be found in the Adrar des Iforas, north-east Mali extending into Algeria.  Defining the Libyan Warrior Period chronologically is a challenge and dates are fairly fluid; the earliest dates suggested start from 5,200 years ago; it certainly coincides with the Horse period between 3,000-2,000 years ago but has also been proposed to continue throughout the Camel Period, from 2,000 years ago to present.

      From the sample of images we have as part of this collection it is clear that not all figures designated as falling under the umbrella term of Libyan Warrior style all share the same characteristics; there are similarities, differences and adjacencies even between what we may term a ‘typical’ representation. Of course, if these images span a period of 5,000 years then this may account for the variability in the depictions.

    body: However, for the majority of figures their posture is remarkably similar
      even though objects of material culture and the types of garments they wear
      may show more diversity. The overriding feature is that figures are positioned
      frontally with arms bent and raised, often displaying splayed fingers. In some
      cases figures hold weapons and shields, but some do not. Some wear obviously
      elaborate headdresses, but in others the features look more coiffure-like. Selected
      garments are decorated with geometric patterns, others are plain; not all wear
      items of personal ornamentation. Certainly, not all figures are associated with
      horses, as typically characterised. Moreover, rather than all being described
      as unsophisticated or careless, many are executed showing great technique and
      skill. So how do we start to make sense of this contradiction between consistency
      and variation?

    body: A criticism of Saharan rock art research, in comparison to that which has
      focused on other parts of Africa, is an under-theorisation of how the art links
      to past ethnic, archaeological or other identities (Smith,2013:156). This is
      tricky when dealing with past societies which were potentially nomadic, and
      where their archaeological remains are scarce. However, recent anthropological
      research may inform our thinking in this area. A member of the Wodaabe cultural
      group (nomadic cattle-herders and traders in the Sahel) on seeing a photograph
      of a Libyan-Warrior engraving and noting the dress and earrings told photographer
      Carol Beckwith that it represents a woman performing a traditional greeting
      dance with arms outstretched and about to clap (Coulson and Campbell,2001:210).

    body: "Such a comment suggests that local ethnographies might assist in an understanding
      of more recent rock art, that not all figures described as Libyan-Warrior may
      necessarily be the same; and indeed that women may not be as rare as previously
      documented. In fact, the Wodaabe have been noted to resemble figures in other
      Saharan rock art contexts (see article on Hairdressing in the Acacus).\n\nIf
      we accept that some of these representations share affinities with the Wodaabe
      then thinking about this category of images from an ethnographic perspective
      may prove productive. Moreover, the British Museum’s existing ethnographic collections
      are simultaneously a useful resource by which we can potentially add more meaning
      to the rock art images.\n\nThe Wodaabe belong to the Fulani people, numbering
      20 million and currently living across eighteen countries. The Wodaabe comprise
      2-3% of the Fulani cultural group, still live as true nomads and are considered
      to have the most traditional culture of all the Fulani (Bovin,2001:13).\t\n"

    body: "The Wodaabe have become particularly well-known in the West through visual
      anthropology, because of their emphasis on cultivating male personal beauty
      and adornment. Men invest enormous amounts of time in personal artistic expression;
      much more so than women. Anthropologists have documented the constant checking
      of Wodaabe men in their mirrors; a Wodaabe man will not even go out among the
      cows in the morning until he has checked and tidied himself. They spend hours
      every day on their appearance and have been described as styling themselves
      like “living paintings” and “living statues” (Bovin, 2001:72). Symmetry plays
      a particularly significant part in Wodaabe culture and is reflected in all their
      artistic expressions. Symmetry stands for culture, asymmetry stands for nature.
      Culture is order and nature is disorder (Bovin,2001:17). Everyday Wodaabe life
      is imbued with artistic expression, whereby “every individual is an active creator,
      decorator and performer (Bovin, 2001:15).\n\nSo, how might we see Wodaabe cultural
      traits reflected in the Libyan-Warrior figures?\n\nPlumage is often depicted
      on these Warrior figures and for the most part is assumed to simply be part
      of the warrior regalia. The ostrich feather, a phallic symbol in Wodaabe culture,
      is an important element in male adornment and is carefully placed in the axis
      of symmetry in the middle of a man’s turban, worn during dancing ceremonies
      (Bovin, 2001:41). Music and dancing are typical of Fulani traditions, characterized
      by group singing and accompanied by clapping, stomping and bells. The feathers
      in the British Museum’s collections are known to be dance ornaments, worn during
      particular ceremonies. \n"

    body: One of the recurring features of the Warrior engravings is the round discs
      that seem to be suspended from a figure’s arm or shoulder. Historically, these
      have been interpreted as shields, which one might expect a warrior to be carrying
      and in part this may be the case.

    body: However, others may represent shoulder bags or flat baskets which are used
      as vessel covers or food trays; both of which are vital items in a nomadic lifestyle.
      Alternatively, they may represent calabashes. Wodaabe women measure their worldly
      wealth in calabashes and can acquire many in a lifetime, mostly ornamental to
      be displayed only on certain ceremonial occasions. If some of these depictions
      are not necessarily men or warriors then what have been considered shields may
      in fact represent some other important item of material culture.

      with abstract geometric combinations; patterns similar to those found on amulets,
      bags, containers and other artefacts as well as rock art.

      There is also a consensus within Wodaabe society about beauty and ugliness; what makes something beautiful or indeed ugly generally is agreed upon, there is a commonality of taste. This may account for the paradox of why there is individuality within a corpus of images that inherently are comparable (Bovin,2001:16).

      As nomads, Wodaabe do not identify themselves by place or territory as such, but a Wodaabe’s body is a repository of culture to mark them out against nature. Culture is not seen as an unessential indulgence but as an imperative necessity, it is part of one’s survival and existence in an inhospitable environment. We may speculate that rock art images may be seen as a way of stamping culture on nature; markers of socialised space.

    body: This brief review was motivated, in part, by the underlying problems inherent
      in the categorisation of visual culture. Historically assigned classifications
      are not fixed and armed with current knowledge across a range of resources we
      may provide further insights into these enigmatic representations. Obviously,
      a much more systematic study of this category known as Libyan-Warrior figures
      needs to be undertaken to determine their distribution and the similarities
      and differences between depictions across sites. Additionally, care must be
      taken making connections with a cultural group whose material culture has changed
      over the course of the twentieth century. Nevertheless, it seems the category
      of Libyan-Warrior figures is an area that is ripe for more intensive investigation.

    body: This app will take you to Game Pass Shelter, one of the most well-known
      rock art sites in South Africa. Situated in the Drakensberg mountains, the shelter
      is a sandstone recess atop a steep slope exhibiting vibrant rock paintings of
      people and animals. The interactive experience is a 360° tour and panoramic
      view of Game Pass, creating the backdrop of the context of the valley from the
      photography available, with interactive ‘hotspots’ with embedded 3D models and
      additional information from the Rock Art archive.

      archive of digitised images (also known as ‘born digital’ artifacts) recording
      rock art sites across Africa. Over 25,000 digital photographs of rock art from
      across Africa have been catalogued – originally from the Trust for African Rock
      Art (TARA) – through generous support from the Arcadia Fund. The central remit
      of the project is to ensure global open access to the TARA archive by developing
      new and innovative ways of engaging with the archive.

    body: |-
      Using innovative digital technology and photogrammetry in combination with our extensive archival photographic collections, we started experimenting with making [3D models](https://sketchfab.com/britishmuseum/collections/african-rock-art) of rock art solely using 20-year-old digitised, archival photographs of the rock art sites.  Building on this work, we realised it would be possible to use these techniques to further contextualize rock art sites in their landscape environment, combining archival images and records with satellite imagery and 360° images of a site -- a technique which proves hugely important for possible reconstructions of heritage sites largely using historical photos!

      Working closely in collaboration with the African Conservation Trust (ACT) ([http://www.projectafrica.com/](http://www.projectafrica.com/)), our colleagues in South Africa, and Soluis ([http://www.soluis.com/heritage/](http://www.soluis.com/heritage/)), our technology partner, we were able to develop the Rock Art VR mobile app by combining our archival photography with additional 360° imagery and mapping of the site of Game Pass Shelter provided by ACT. Rather than simply using modern 3D scanning and regular VR methods, Soluis developed innovative solutions in order to combine the archival imagery, 360° photos, and satellite videos to create an immersive VR tour of Game Pass Shelter that would be still be accessible on widely-available smartphone technology and simple cardboard headsets. By using widely-available mobile technology, it will be possible for ACT and our other project partners in Africa to easily use the app for education and outreach purposes, in particular at rock art centres (Kamberg, Didima, and KZM museum) in South Africa where local custodians teach school children about rock art and its importance.

    body: Around 30,000 years ago, in the hot, arid environment of the Huns Mountains
      in southern Namibia, modern humans painted images of animals, including rhinoceros,
      onto plaques of stone. A couple of thousand years earlier, in the cold, harsh
      tundra-like conditions of the Ardèche in south-central France, modern humans
      were also painting images of rhinoceros onto cave walls. The oldest scientifically
      dated rock art in Africa and Europe may be 8000 km apart but coincide both temporally
      and in subject matter. One of the oldest images that humans selected to depict
      was the formidable rhinoceros. The choice of subject matter in rock art depictions
      was not simply based on the presence or abundance of a particular species; rather

    body: The black rhino is smaller than the white rhino, although adults can still
      reach 1.5 metres in height and weigh in at 1.4 tonnes. The black rhino has a
      reputation for being extremely aggressive, and will not hesitate to charge at
      a perceived threat.  Black rhinos were once common throughout sub-Saharan Africa.
      However, persistent hunting by European settlers saw their numbers quickly decline,
      and they currently number around 5,000. The species is currently found in patchy
      distribution throughout South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya.

      In both species, a layer of fat sits between the hide and the flesh of the animal and in the white rhinoceros this can be up to or exceed a thickness of 50mm. It is well known that San|Bushmen believed the fat around the heart of the eland contained high levels of supernatural potency, and like the eland, they believed the rhinoceros to be especially potent animals (Ouzman, 1996:45)

      Rhinoceros in rock art imagery are both painted and engraved, but the prevalence of engraved images in southern African rock art is pronounced. Rhinoceros are well represented, even dominant, at numerous engraving sites in the Free State, Gauteng, Northern Cape and North West provinces of South Africa and at numerous Namibian sites (Ouzman, 1996:42)

    body: "Most rock art researchers consider the engravings of San/Bushmen, like
      paintings, to have been influenced by shamanism (Ouzman, 1996:36). Both painted
      and engraved images share certain distinctive traits which suggest that both
      art forms were the result of a single belief system. These shared features include:
      a selected range of animals, unusual body postures in human figures, complex
      ‘scenes’ and non-realistic features on both animals and humans such as the addition
      or absence of limbs, conflation of human and animal morphology and exaggerated
      attributes (Ouzman, 1996:36) These features are critical to our understanding
      of the images as they are inextricably tied in to San|Bushman belief systems.\n\nThere
      are very few references to rhinoceros in San|Bushman ethnography. However, what
      does exist indicates that rhinoceros were of supernatural importance to certain
      groups of San|Bushmen (Ouzman, 1996:42). One particular site named Thaba Sione
      in South Africa, is primarily known for its numerous engravings of rhinoceros
      and may have been chosen as an engraving site because rhinoceros were known
      to have frequented the site. \n\nThaba Sione (Zion’s Hill) a low hill of less
      than nine metres in height is an important archaeological and rock art site
      in the North West province. It is scattered with more than 450 engraved dolerite
      boulders with the seasonal Thlakajeng River running 350 metres south-west containing
      numerous waterholes. The hill is bounded by 27 standing stones that have been
      rubbed smooth by rhinoceros after wallowing in the muddy waterholes of the river
      (Ouzman, 1996:40). Interestingly, one third of all the stones that he been rubbed
      by rhinoceros are also engraved (Lewis-Williams & Blundell, 1998:111).\n"

    body: "Dating rock engravings is always problematic, and the imagery at Thaba
      Sione has been estimated to fall within a broad estimate of between 1,200 -
      10,000 years old (Ouzman, 1995:55). Rock art of the last 2,000 years correlates
      with a number of different cultural groups such as farmers, pastoralists, hunter-gatherers
      etc. However, the rock art at Thaba Sione is attributed to San|Bushmen and widely
      understood to reflect a shamanic belief system. Situated close to a waterhole
      it has been proposed that Thaba Sione was selected specifically by the San|Bushmen
      for rain-making beliefs and practices, but appears to have been modified as
      a result of Bantu-speaking farmers moving into the area from around 1500 years
      ago.\n\nIt is thought that the population of Thaba Sione were similar in social,
      economic and cultural terms to the now extinct |Xam, a cultural group who inhabited
      the central interior of South Africa and for whom we have extensive ethnographic
      accounts. Additionally, they are likely to have been similarly comparable to
      the !Kung and Ju|’hoan, contemporary cultural groups who live to the north of
      Thaba Sione in Botswana and Namibia. A comparison of rock art imagery at Thaba
      Sione and the ethnographic accounts of the |Xam and !Kung show strong similarities
      in belief systems pertaining to shamanism (Ouzman, 1996:39).\n\nThaba Sione
      has been a primary focus for archaeologists as there are [559 identified engraved
      images ](http://bit.ly/2pLfwp4)located on or close to the hill site showing
      a wide variety of depictions. Images include baboon, birds, buffalo, eland,
      elephant, felines, giraffe, human figures, lizard, ostrich, rhinoceros, warthog
      and zebra (Ouzman, 1996:41). "

      (62 or 11.1%), after human figures (72 or 12.9%) (Ouzman, 1996:43). Of the 62
      engravings, around 65% have been identified as white rhinoceros, based on the
      animals’ pronounced nuchal hump (the hump on the dorsal part of the neck), its
      large front horn and its square lip. The remaining 35% are of the smaller black
      rhino based on the hook lip that hangs from its upper jaw and its smaller nuchal
      hump. Historically, both species of rhinoceros were widespread in the area around
      Thaba Sione (Ouzman, 1996:45).

    body: "Rhinoceros show more ‘non-real’ features, combinations and variations in
      engraving techniques and occur in more complex ‘scenes’ than any other category
      of image at the site.\n\nFive of the engravings of rhinoceros are notable by
      the presence of ‘non-realistic’ features. Although the number of rhinoceros
      with these attributes is very small in comparison to the overall number of images
      of rhinoceros, it has been proposed that the placement and number of these features
      outweigh those found on other images. Such features are thought to convey information
      which related to three aspects of San shamanism, namely “shamanic transformation,
      gender relations and rain-making” (Ouzman, 1996:42).\n\nOne of these five images
      shows a part-human and part-rhinoceros figure. The posture of this therianthropic
      figure has its hand to its nose. When shamans are performing their medicine
      dance, they sometimes experience bleeding from the nose both before and after
      they enter a trance-like state. This posture combined with other features such
      as two rhinoceros-like horns, a short, thick, rhino-like tail, one back leg
      akin to that of a rhinoceros and the other back leg terminating in a human foot,
      as well as a fat pendulous body has been proposed to be a “shaman in a trance
      who has assumed, in part, rhinoceros form and potency” (Ouzman, 1996:46).\n\nAnother
      engraving shows the horns of two black rhinoceros which have been deliberately
      elongated and truncated respectively in order to project towards a fissure in
      the rock face. It has been argued that cracks or fissures in the rock face were
      seen as entry and exit points to the spirit world and the rock face acted as
      veil between these two worlds. These two horns are thus not real but are closely
      associated with the spirit world which the rhinoceros are entering, leaving
      or even guarding (Ouzman, 1996:49). \n"

    body: 'An additional engraving of a black rhinoceros shows three horns and has
      been argued to indicate a supernatural significance and possibly a transformed
      shaman. However, in real life female rhinoceros sometimes have a third horn
      as a deformity and this engraving possibly attempts to emphasise the role of
      the female shaman as a potent guardian and protector. Yet the message is unclear
      since, as black rhinoceros are known for their anti-social, unpredictable and
      violent behaviour it is uncertain whether engraved rhinoceros with “nuanced
      horns” are indicative of feminine or masculine gender and power relations, possibly
      containing elements of both. The shaman was a person who moved between the real
      and the non-real world, and is characterised by ambiguity and tension, so maintaining
      an indistinct gender identity in this context conforms to what we know of shamanic
      practices and representations (Ouzman, 1996:50). '

    body: "San|Bushman shamans were also inextricably linked with rain-making ceremonies.
      The ritual involved the whole of the community but it was the shaman, while
      in a trance-like state, that captured the rain in a perceived animal-like state.
      The rain animal was either seen as an ill-tempered ‘rain-bull’, characterised
      by thunder and lightning and harmful to life, or as a more pleasant ‘rain-cow’,
      which provided the temperate rains that renewed the grassland (Ouzman, 1996:51)
      Rain animals were not seen as a distinct species of animal, but were depicted
      with large bodies and were often horned; one of the few ethnographic accounts
      that refer to rhinoceros implicate them in rain-making (Ouzman, 1996:52).  \n\nIn
      some contexts certain physical and behavioural characteristics of rhinoceros
      may have been perceived by some San|Bushman as closely paralleling the perceived
      appearance and behaviour of a rain animal. These features include its fat and
      horns, its association with water and its nocturnal habits (in San|Bushman accounts
      of rain-making, shamans capture the rain animals at night). If rhinoceros were
      associated with rain animals, the more gregarious white rhinoceros might have
      been equated with the rain-cow while the ill-tempered black rhinoceros with
      the angry rain-bull (Ouzman, 1996:54).\n\nAt further sites in the Free State
      province of South Africa and the Erongo Mountains of Namibia, painted therianthropic
      figures (part-human, part-rhinoceros) depicting unusual body postures reminiscent
      of the *Great Trance Dance* and non-realistic features such as exaggerated horn
      size also seem draw on the rhinoceros as an animal of potency (Hollmann and
      Lewis-Williams, 2006). Furthermore, a golden rhinoceros from the Iron Age site
      of Mapungubwe in northern South Africa is testament to the status in which these
      animals were held, not only by San/Bushmen, but by other cultural groups in
      southern Africa. Thriving between 1220-1300 AD, and inhabited by ancestors of
      the Shona people of Zimbabwe, Mapungubwe was the centre of the largest kingdom
      in the subcontinent, trading gold and ivory with China, India and Egypt. Made
      of gold foil wrapped around a wooden core, the rhinoceros is a symbol of leadership
      among the Shona.\n\nRhinos have been represented in rock art for more than 30,000
      years, and have played a significant spiritual and cultural role in African
      societies.\n"

    body: "The impact of colonisation in South Africa as a result of Dutch and English
      settlement from 1652 onwards has been well-documented - with devastating consequences
      socially, economically and culturally for many indigenous populations. \nOne
      of those impacts was the demise of rock art as a cultural practice by many San|Bushmen,
      with the last rock art being made around 100 years ago. Nevertheless, rock art
      has provided some interesting glimpses into Colonial events, experiences and
      encounters from an indigenous perspective. Depictions of ships, horse-drawn
      wagons, guns and people wearing European clothing are not simply observational
      records in stone, but tell of history and heritage, memory and identity. This
      type of rock art, one that depicts European objects and people, is termed '*contact
      art*'.\n"

    body: Throughout the 15th century, Portuguese mariners navigated the western coast
      of Africa exploiting the lucrative trade possibilities on the continent. In
      1487, Bartholomeu Dias’s expedition of two 50-ton caravels (small, fast Portuguese
      sailing ships of the 15th–17th centuries) anchored in Mossel Bay on the Southern
      Cape coast because of a storm, later sailing along the coast to Algoa Bay (east
      of the Cape of Good Hope) before returning to Lisbon. Ten years later, in 1497
      another Portuguese expedition led by Vasco de Gama sailed along the eastern
      coastline to modern day Mombasa before crossing the Indian Ocean to India (Thompson,
      2014:31)

    body: On 25 March 1647 the Dutch vessel, the *Nieuwe Haerlem*, was wrecked in
      a storm in Table Bay. Sixty crewman and a junior merchant named Janszen remained
      in the Cape for a year waiting for another vessel to collect the crew and rescued
      cargo to return to Holland. During the waiting period Janszen and his crew grew
      vegetables, bartered fresh meat from the Khoi and fished. Upon his return to
      Holland in 1649, Janszen produced a report for the Dutch East India Company
      on the feasibility of the Cape as a refreshment station. Janszen recommended
      it for its strategic location, the fertility of the land, the abundance of fish
      and most importantly, the lack of animosity towards strangers of the indigenous
      people (Adjibolosoo, 2001:141) Three years later, in 1652, Jan Van Riebeek and
      80 employees of the Dutch East India Company arrived as commander of the Cape
      with the aim of building a fort and supplying the Dutch fleets with fruit, vegetables
      and meat (Thompson, 2014:32). Van Riebeek established what is now Cape Town
      and is seen by many Afrikaaners as the founding father of their nation.

    body: 'However, the expansion of the Dutch East India Company to the north and
      east of the Cape region resulted in the marginalisation of local populations.
      By 1740, less than a hundred years after the Dutch arrived, the traditional
      hunter-gatherer-fisher way of life in the Cape had all but disappeared either
      by the active dispossession of land, sustained political interference or enforced
      labour. For the indigenous populations, their “ultimate position as a servile
      and landless class inevitably led to the beginnings of the extinction of local
      indigenous culture” (Yates *et al*.1993:59). This contact between indigenous
      populations and European colonists was expressed early in the contact period
      and most vividly in rock art imagery. '

    body: The detailed depiction of the vessel suggests that the artist was visually
      familiar with European ships. However, while three of the mast flags are pointing
      in the same direction, the flag on the mizzenmast (far right in the image) flies
      in the opposite direction, suggesting the artist was less conversant with the
      technology of sailing ships. In 2016, British Museum curators requested that
      the image of the Porterville Galleon was assessed by experts at the National
      Maritime Museum, who identified a cross on the shoreline (on the left of the
      image) and the ship to the right, including a bow, short bowsprit crossed with
      a spritsail yard, and three masts with Dutch flags. The combination of these
      features suggests the ship dates to the mid-seventeenth century date, coinciding
      with sinking of the *Nieuwe Haerlem* and the founding of Cape Town (Giblin and
      Spring, 2016:69).

    body: "*Attakwaskloof* \n\nIn an east-facing sandstone overhang just north of
      Mossel Bay on the Southern Cape coast, the black charcoal outline of a sailing
      ship is drawn in a deep and broad crevice. Reddish-orange paint was applied
      to the rock surface first and may have served as a background or canvas on which
      the ship was then painted. The ship is superimposed on numerous fine line red
      paintings of human figures and animals as well as a series of 13 red handprints
      and black dots (Leggatt and Rust, 2004: 5). Although the site is more than 30km
      from the coast, the details of the ship visible above the water line are portrayed
      in clear detail. The depiction of the sailing ship corresponds with what we
      know of sailing ships rounding the Cape of Good Hope from the end of the 16th
      century.  \n\nThe tricolour design of the flag on the mainmast suggests that
      the ship represents a Dutch vessel (Leggatt and Rust, 2004: 6). Prior to 1595
      the only sailing ships known to have visited Mossel Bay were Portuguese vessels,
      which did not fly tricolour flags. Moreover, they attempted to avoid the southern
      African coast after a conflict with Khoe herders in Table Bay in 1510. The first
      Dutch sailing ships under the command of Cornelis de Houtman anchored in Mossel
      Bay on 4th August 1595, spending a week in the harbour bartering iron for cattle
      with the local populations (Leggatt and Rust, 2004:6).\n"

    body: "It is difficult to know exactly who the artists were of this so-called
      ‘contact art’, but the images of ships are likely to have been made by Khoe
      pastoralists and San|Bushmen hunter-gatherers who were the indigenous populations
      when Dutch ships started landing around the southern coastline of South Africa.\n\n*Swartruggens*\n\nLater
      colonial period rock art can be found in a cluster of sites in the Swartruggens
      Hills, on the eastern margins of the Cederburg Mountains. Increasingly, European
      farmers started using the Swartruggens for grazing, and by 1728 some colonists
      were present in the region. The relative isolation of the area provided a refuge
      for escaped slaves, discontented employees of the Dutch East India Company and
      the remaining populations of the Khoisan communities (Hall and Mazel, 2005:127).
      \ \n\nThe rock art at Swartruggens comprises a limited but repeated set of motifs.
      These include men in European clothing, notably wearing wide-brimmed hats and
      boots, and women wearing bell-shaped crinoline dresses, cinched in at the waist.
      Many of the dresses are patterned with vertical and horizontal stripes.  The
      shape and style of these dresses are reminiscent of those that dominated western
      female fashion between 1830-1860, and the grid pattern was a popular pattern
      during this time (Hall and Mazel, 2005:132). Some men are depicted smoking pipes
      and firing guns. \n"

    body: Horses and mules are prevalent, often depicted feeding at troughs, running
      free and harnessed pulling wagons (Hall and Mazel, 2005:131). Of the 340 images
      at the site of Stompiesfontein, 165 are images of horses with 33 depictions
      of wagons - more than half the total number of images. Wagons are generally
      depicted in profile being pulled by team of 4, 6 or 8 horses (Hall and Mazel,
      2005:134). The drivers of the wagons are clearly identified, wearing large brimmed
      hats holding long whips. In all cases the artist has depicted the interior of
      the wagon clearly showing the transportation of both men and women and in some
      cases children.  Alongside the wagons are men driving packhorses or mules with
      others riding on horseback. A repeated feature in the wagon panels is the depiction
      of women who are always positioned above the wagons and encircled by finger
      dots (Hall and Mazel, 2005:135). The use of horse-drawn transport has been dated
      to around the early 19th century and coincides with the development of better
      road systems from Cape Town into the southern and eastern Cape regions (Hall
      and Mazel, 2005:136) However, until 1848, with the opening of Michell’s Pass,
      the area around Swartruggens was not easily accessible by horse-drawn wagons,
      which make a probable date of later than 1850 for the paintings (Hall and Mazel,
      2005:137).

      Many of the wagons depicted at Swatruggens are of a type known as the Spring Wagon or Spring Wagonette. Of South African design, these wagons were manufactured in large numbers in the last three decades of the 19th century in response to the demand for transport to the diamond mines in the north of the country (Hall and Mazel, 2005:138). As such, the wagons seen in the Swartruggens rock art are likely to have been painted from the 1870s onwards but before 1885 when the railroad reached the diamond region of Kimberley in the north.

      The contact period rock art at Swartruggens then seems to depict a certain event during the late 19th century when people were moving northwards seeking wealth and fortune. The production and reception of these images “stemmed from local, social, political and economic conditions of the farm labourers, squatters, drovers and shepherds - whom we assume were among the artists” (Hall and Mazel, 2005:141).

    body: "The identity of the artists and their relationships with the figures depicted
      is an interesting yet complex one. Do the images simply portray experiences
      of contact with Europeans or were the artists framing themselves within these
      tableaux? It is likely that wagons are the property of the Europeans and that
      the majority, if not all, of the passengers depicted are European. \n\nA common
      posture for figures painted outside of the context of wagons is a characteristic
      hands-on-hips posture, which has been identified as an European stance. Interestingly,
      this is a universal convention employed by contact period artists around the
      world in their depiction of both male and female European colonists (Hall and
      Mazel, 2005:142). This convention may possibly just be an observation of cultural
      differences, but as Hall and Mazel have suggested, “it potentially makes a wry
      comment about a posture of arrogance and people in the possession of idle hands“
      (Hall and Mazel, 12005:142). In the rock art of the Swartruggens there does
      not appear to be any intentionality on the part of the artists to insert themselves
      into the scenes, “the people, events and episodes depicted are of the Europeans’
      world and the art seems to be all about ‘outsiders’” (Hall and Mazel, 2005:143).\n"

    body: However, this does not apply to other examples of contact rock art. Recent
      research has shown that some depictions in the Maloti-Drakensberg reveal a cultural
      admixture of both European and indigenous elements. In the 19th century, groups
      comprising San-, Khoe- and Bantu-speaking peoples came together to form a new
      cultural identity. These short-lived but culturally mixed groups reflected the
      social, economic and political milieu of 19th century South Africa, raiding
      their European neighbours for cattle and horses, exchanging them for corn, tobacco
      and dogs (Challis, 2012:265). As well as being ethnically diverse, they shared
      certain customs and belief systems.  In this “creolised” (Challis, 2012:80)
      rock art depictions show figures on horseback, armed with guns, bows, spears,
      and knobkerries, wearing feathered headgear , wide-brimmed hats, tasselled armbands
      and skin capes (Challis, 2012:277)

      rock art depictions show that traditional belief systems were incorporated into
      these tableaux. Some images depict figures engaged in dancing a variation of
      the Trance Dance, a traditional San medicine dance whereby shamans would enter
      altered states of consciousness and are represented transforming into symbolic
      animals such as the eland. Contact rock art amalgamates this with elements of
      Nguni (a local and indigenous cultural group of South Africa) culture and shamans
      transform instead into baboons, a symbolic animal for the Nguni that is associated
      with ideas of protection (Challis, 2014:249).

    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 1'
    body: Ethiopia is the biggest country of the Horn of Africa, a very diverse country
      which has traditionally been a melting pot of cultures, religions and ethnicities,
      acting as a crossroads between the Nile valley region, the Red Sea and East
      Africa. Most rock art is located in the southern part of the country, although
      smaller concentrations have been documented near the borders with Eritrea, Sudan
      and Kenya. Ethiopian rock art shows strong similarities with other countries
      in the Horn of Africa as well as Sudan and mostly consists of cow depictions
      dated from the 3rd millennium onwards, although other animals, anthropomorphic
      figures and geometric symbols are also fairly common.

    title: Geography and rock art distribution
    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 2'
    body: The geography of Ethiopia is varied and ranges from high plateaus to savannahs
      and deserts.   The eastern part mostly consists of a range of plateaus and high
      mountains, which in some cases reach more than 4000m above sea level. To the
      north of these mountains is Lake Tana, the biggest lake in Ethiopia and the
      source of the Blue Nile, one of the two tributaries of the Nile. The mountains
      are divided in two by the Great Rift Valley, which runs north-east to south-west,
      - and is one of the most important areas for the study of human evolution. The
      highlands are surrounded by tropical savannah and grassland regions to the west
      and south-west, while to the east lays the Danakil desert, one of the most inhospitable
      regions on earth. The south-eastern corner of Ethiopia, which borders Somalia,
      is a semi-desert plateau ranging from 300-1500 m above sea level.

    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 3'
    body: 'Ethiopian rock art is located around two main areas: around the city of
      Harar to the east and the Sidamo region to the south-west. The first group comprises
      mainly painted depictions, while the second one is characterized by a bas-relief
      technique specific only to this area. However, rock art has also been discovered
      in other areas, such as the border with Eritrea, the area near Kenya and the
      Benishangul-Gumuz region, a lowland area along the border with Sudan. As research
      increases, it is likely that more rock art sites will be discovered throughout
      the country. In addition to these engravings and paintings, Ethiopia is also
      known for its decorated stelae, tall stone obelisks that are usually engraved
      with culturally and religiously important symbols. One of these places is Tiya,
      a burial place declared a World Heritage Site which has 32 richly decorated
      stelae. Although not strictly rock art in the traditional sense, they nevertheless
      represent one of the most interesting group of archaeological remains in the
      south of Ethiopia and demonstrate similar techniques to some of the engraved
      depictions.'

    title: Research history
    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 4'
    body: Ethiopian rock art has played a key role in the Horn of Africa research,
      and the studies undertaken in this country have structured the chronologies,
      styles and interpretations of the whole region. Research started as early as
      the mid-1930s when the Abbé Henri Breuil proposed a classification of Ethiopian
      rock art through the study of the Porc-Epic and Genda-Biftou sites. This proposal
      stated a progressive evolution in eight steps from naturalism to schematism,
      and set the interpretative framework for succeeding decades. Breuil’s ideas
      were generally followed by John Desmond Clark in his synthesis of the rock art
      in the Horn of Africa in 1954, and they also appear in the work of Paolo Graziosi
      (1964). During the 1960s, research was carried out by Francis Anfray in the
      Sidamo area and by Gerard Bailloud near Harar, where a report made for the Ethiopian
      government informed about the existence of around ten rock art sites in the
      same area.

    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 5'
    body: Rock art research in Ethiopia has traditionally included the term Ethiopian-Arabian
      style, coined in 1971 by Červiček to show the similarities between the depictions
      found in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The existence of this
      style is currently the paradigm used in most rock art interpretations of the
      region, although some concerns have been raised due to its too generic characteristics,
      which can be found in many other parts of Africa.  The 1990s and 2000s have
      seen a remarkable increase of rock art research in the country, with the renewal
      of studies in the main areas and the beginning of research in the regions of
      Tigray and Benishangul-Gumuz.

    body: Cattle and cattle-related depictions are the main subject of Ethiopian rock
      art, regardless of their relative chronology. The oldest depictions (based on
      Červiček’s works) are of humpless cows, while in the late stages of rock art
      humped cows and camels appear. Goats, sheep and dogs are very occasionally depicted,
      and unlike the Saharan rock art, wild animals such as giraffes and antelopes
      are scarce. Figures of cattle appear alone or in herds, and the depictions of
      cows with calves are a fairly common motif not only in Ethiopia but in the whole
      Horn of Africa.

    body: The other main group of depictions is of anthropomorphs, which are usually
      schematic and often distributed in rows. In some cases, the tendency to schematism
      is so pronounced that human figures are reduced to an H-like shape. Sometimes,
      human figures are represented as warriors, carrying weapons and on occasion
      fighting against other humans or big felines. Along with these figurative themes,
      geometric signs are very common in Ethiopian rock art, including groups of dots
      and other motifs that have been interpreted as symbols associated with groups
      that historically lived in the region.

    body: 'Not all themes are distributed in every area. In Sidamo, almost all figures
      depict humpless cows, while subjects in the Harar region show a far bigger variability.
      Again, differences in techniques are also evident: while depictions in the Harar
      region are mainly paintings, in Sidamo many figures are engraved in a very singular
      way, lowering the area around the figures to achieve a bas-relief effect. The
      clear differences between the Sidamo engravings (known as the Chabbé-Galma group)
      and those of the Harar (the Laga Oda-Sourré group) have led to criticisms about
      the perceived uniformity of the *Ethiopian-Arabian* style.'

    title: Chronology
    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 9'
    body: As is the case with most African rock art, absolute dates for depictions
      based on radiocarbon techniques are scarce, and therefore most of the chronological
      framework of Ethiopian rock art has to rely on the analysis of figures, superimpositions,
      parallels with depictions of better known areas and other indirect dating methods.
      In Ethiopian rock art it is generally assumed that the oldest depictions could
      be dated to the mid-third millennium BC, according to parallels with other Saharan
      rock art. As aforementioned, the so-called Ethiopian-Arabian style shows an
      evolution from naturalism to schematism, with an older group (Sourré-Hanakiya)
      showing strong similarities with rock art in Egypt, Sudan and Libya. A second,
      progressively schematic group (Dahtami) would last until the end of the first
      millennium BC. This date is supported by the appearance of camels and humped
      cows (zebus), which were introduced in the region at the end of the second half
      of the 1st millennium BC. The last stages of Ethiopian rock art relating to
      camel, warriors and geometric depictions can be considered to belong to the
      historical period, in some cases reaching very near to the present day.

    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 1'
    body: The rock art of Egypt was largely unknown outside of the region until the
      beginning of the 20th century. The rock paintings and engravings of Egypt feature
      a range of subjects and styles, including domestic cattle, wild animals, humans,
      boat images and inscriptions. Much of the rock art appears to date from within
      the last 8,000 years. However, earlier Palaeolithic engravings have also been
      found near the Nile, suggesting a longer time frame for the practice. The majority
      of Egypt’s most famous rock art, including the ‘Cave of Swimmers’, is found
      in the desert in the far south-west of the country.

    title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 3'
    body: |-
      The presence of rock art in Egypt has been noticed by European scholars since the early 19th century. Geographically isolated from the bulk of rock art in the country, the paintings and engravings of Gilf Kebir and Jebel Uweinat were first catalogued in the 1920s by the Egyptian explorers and public figures Hassanein Bey and Prince Kemal el Dine, and thereafter by renowned early twentieth century explorers and ethnographers such as László Almásy, Leo Frobenius, Ralph Bagnold and Abbé Breuil, whose expeditions helped bring Saharan rock art into wider public consciousness.

      Hans Winkler’s seminal *Rock Drawings of Southern Upper Egypt* (1938-9) was one of the first regional catalogues and remains a pre-eminent review of finds. Further cataloguing of rock art images and sites in the southern Nile valley took place at the time of the construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s. Where rock art historically was part of larger archaeological research in the area, in recent years it has been subject to more direct and rigorous study which will contribute to a better understanding of chronologies and relationships.

    title: Themes
    title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 4'
    body: In desert areas, recognisably stylised Pharaonic-period inscriptions and
      engravings from between 3,100 and 30 BC can be found on rock faces, particularly
      at oases and quarry sites such as Kharga Oasis and Wadi Hammamat in the Western
      and Eastern deserts. There is also rock art from later periods like that at
      Matna el-Barqa in the Western Desert hinterland, where both Pharaonic and later
      Coptic inscriptions mix with images of gods and horsemen. Earlier examples of
      engraved rock art may be found in the Nile valley, in what is now southern Egypt
      and northern Sudan, linked to progenitors of ancient Egyptian cultures, most
      particularly the people of the Naqada Periods (4,000-3,100 BC). This art is
      characterised by frequent depictions on pottery of river boats, which occur
      in much of the rock art near the Nile, and include, pecked on a boulder at Nag
      el-Hamdulab near Aswan, what is considered the first known depiction of a Pharaoh,
      on just such a boat. Also prevalent in these areas are numerous engravings of
      animals and human figures.

    title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 6'
    body: Certainly, not all rock art found in Egypt has direct links to Pharaonic
      cultures. Recently, the rock art at Qurta, south of Edfu, of naturalistic outline
      engravings of ancient aurochs (ancestors of domestic cattle), were dated reliably
      to the Palaeolithic Period, between 16,000 and 15,000 years ago, making them
      the oldest known rock art in northern Africa. Between the eighth and fourth
      millennia BC, Egypt’s climate was generally temperate, interrupted only briefly
      by dry spells, until the increasing aridity thereafter concentrated life in
      the Eastern Sahara around the river’s banks.

    body: Some of Egypt’s most striking and famous rock art is found far from the
      Nile at Gilf Kebir, a vast sandstone plateau in the desert near the Libyan border.
      As elsewhere in the Sahara, there are frequent depictions of domestic cattle,
      people and wild animals. Like most rock art, the paintings and engravings here
      are hard to date accurately but may refer to the ‘Bovidian Period’ (Pastoral
      Period) rock art of the wider Sahara, typified by paintings and engravings of
      cattle and people (Huyge, 2009). However, the scholarly community recognises
      the inherent difficulty of formulating conclusions of direct links with wider
      rock art practices. Some evidence of pastoralists in the area means that this
      rock art could have been made as early as the fifth millennium BC and are thus
      possibly contemporaneous with Predynastic Egyptian cultures, but not necessarily
      connected (Riemer, 2013).

    title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 9'
    body: The motivation behind producing these images remains elusive. Where a particular
      cosmology is better known, it can be speculated, such as the Nile boat paintings
      have been suggested to evoke funerary beliefs and practices. If nothing else,
      the cattle paintings of Gilf Kebir demonstrate the importance of cattle in the
      pastoralist culture that produced them. Despite still being relatively little
      known, the ‘mystique’ behind rock art has cultivated popular curiosity, in particular
      in Gilf Kebir’s famous ‘Cave of Swimmers’. This is a shallow rock shelter featuring
      many painted human figures in strange contortions, as if swimming – images which
      have captured the popular imagination, with their glimpse of life in Egypt millennia
      before the Pharaohs and their hints at a watery Sahara.

    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 1'
    body: Niger is geographically diverse, having both the Sahel (savannah) and the
      Sahara (desert). The majority of the country’s rock art – made up predominantly
      of engravings – is located in the northern desert area, in and around the Aïr
      Mountains, where some of the art is thought to be several thousand years old.
      The Djado Plateau in the north-east is also rich in art that includes both paintings
      and engravings. One of the most celebrated sites of rock engraving is at a place
      called Dabous, to the west of the mountains. Here, two life-size giraffe were
      carved on the top of an outcrop, and may be up to 6,000 years old. Other notable
      areas for engravings are Iwellene in the northern Aïr Mountains, where some
      of the art is thought to be several thousand years old, as well the sites of
      Tanakom and Tagueit in the south-eastern Aïr Mountains, where engravings are
      located on the sides of two wadis (dry riverbeds).

      the Aïr Mountains and the rock engravings of the Adrar des Iforas in Mali. Stylistic
      similarities also exist with some of the art of the Tadrart (Acacus) and in

      art of the Djado Plateau and art in south-west Libya and south-east Algeria.
      Equally, similarities have been observed with the Tazina-style engravings in
      south-western Algeria and south-eastern Morocco.

    title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 4'
    body: Consisting predominantly of engravings, the majority of depictions in this
      region fall within the so-called Libyan Warrior period or style of art, dating
      from 1,500–3,000 years ago, characterised by forward-facing figures with metal
      weapons and horses. Approximately 1,000 engravings of warriors have been recorded
      from the Aïr Mountains in Niger, as well as the Adrar des Iforas in bordering
      Mali. Based on investigations into the garments worn, accessories, headdresses
      and weaponry, and by studying the placement and superimposition of images, it
      has been proposed that there are two main stages of this Libyan Warrior rock
      art. The oldest is linked to a pastoral economy based on cattle-rearing, when
      metal had been introduced to the region and the use of the spear took over from
      the traditional bow. This region also hosts images of wild animals such as Barbary
      sheep and ostrich, as well as cattle.

      images of wild animals such as elephants, rhinoceros, giraffe and other game,
      and dated to the Early Hunter or Bubalus Period; human figures are very rare.
      Tazina-style engravings – similar to those found in south-eastern Morocco –
      also occur, as well as polychrome fine-line and finger paintings that are unique
      to this area.

    body: The number of cattle depictions is small, but particular images of calves
      attached to a lead can be compared stylistically with images of cattle in Tassili
      n’Ajjer, Algeria. Moreover, Henri Lhote noted the resemblance between these
      rock art depictions and the husbandry practices of the present day Wodaabe people
      of Niger, who use a similar calf rope. The calf rope (a long rope comprising
      loops within which the heads of the calves are secured) is both practical and
      symbolic, ensuring the cows always return to their home camp, while also physically
      dividing the camp into male and female halves. It is interesting to note the
      close relationship between the rock art of regions that today are politically
      discrete.

    title: History of rock art discovery in Niger
    title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 7'
    body: Until relatively recently rock art research has been sporadic in Niger.
      In the 1920s Major Gen. Francis Rodd, a British explorer and army officer, made
      two great expeditions into the Sahara. He was the first person to make a serious
      study of the Tuareg and documented some of the rock art in the Aïr Mountains.
      Subsequently, French colonial officers noted some sites around 1960. However,
      it was French archaeologist Henri Lhote who undertook major recording programmes
      throughout the 1960s and 1970s to document, trace and publish several thousand
      engravings. Very little information is known relating the rock art to known
      cultural groups, either past or present. Most of the sites were not habitation
      sites, and were probably only occasionally visited by nomadic societies in the
      past, so very little (if any) archaeological evidence remains. Most of the art
      predates the residence of the Tuareg, who now inhabit this area and who appear
      to have no direct connections with the art. The Tuareg recognise old script
      which sometimes accompanies images as it closely resembles their own writing,
      *Tifinagh*; however, it is incomprehensible to them if it is more than 100 years
      old.

      rock art regions, both on the Djado Plateau and the Aïr Mountains, this period
      can probably be dated to between 7,000 and 4,000 years ago. A few cattle are
      depicted in a similar fashion to the big game of the Early Hunter Period, which
      raises the question of whether the nomadic cattle-herding culture emerged from
      a hunting lifestyle, or at least rapidly succeeded it.

    body: Consisting predominantly of rock engravings and found in the Aïr Mountains,
      the Horse Period and Libyan Warrior Period date from around 3,000–1,500 years
      ago. Depictions are of horses with so-called Libyan Warriors, with metal weapons
      or with chariots and charioteers. Human figures, which often appear with horses,
      were sometimes depicted with elaborate apparel; others were drawn with stylized
      bodies consisting of two triangles joined at the apex. Wild animals such as
      Barbary sheep and ostrich, as well as cattle, appear in this art. Art of the
      Horse Period is not widely represented in the Djado Plateau, suggesting that
      Berber groups did not reach the region in any great numbers – but it has been
      proposed that certain peculiarities of style may suggest an influence from Aïr.

    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 1'
    body: Algeria is Africa’s largest country geographically and has long been noted
      for its rich concentrations of rock art, particularly in the Tassili n’Ajjer,
      inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. More than 15,000 paintings
      and engravings, some of which date back up to 12,000 years, provide unique insights
      into the environmental, social, cultural and economic changes in the country
      across a period of 10,000 or more years. The area is particularly famous for
      its Round Head paintings, first described and published in the 1930s by French
      archaeologist Henry Lhote.

    title: Geography
    title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 2'
    body: Algeria is situated in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered on the
      west by Morocco and on the east by Tunisia and Libya, with a long Mediterranean
      coastline to the north. The Atlas Mountains cross Algeria east to west along
      the Mediterranean coast. The northern portion of the country is an area of mountains,
      valleys, and plateaus, but more than 80% of the country falls within the Sahara
      Desert. Rock art is located in the Algerian Maghreb and the Hoggar Mountains
      but the richest zone of rock art is located in the mountain range of Tassili
      n'Ajjer, a vast plateau in the south-east of the country. Water and sand erosion
      have carved out a landscape of thin passageways, large arches, and high-pillared
      rocks, described by Lhote as 'forests of stone'.

    title: Research history
    title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 3'
    body: |-
      Rock art in Algeria, notably the engravings in South Oran, has been the subject of European study since 1863. Notable surveys were made by A. Pomel (1893-1898), Stéphane Gsell (1901-1927), G. B. M. Flamand (1892-1921), Leo Frobenius and Hugo Obermaier (1925), Henri Breuil (1931-1957), L. Joleaud (1918-1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (1935-1955). Henri Lhote visited the area in 1955 and 1964, completing previous research and adding new descriptions included in a major publication on the area in 1970.

      The rock art of the Tassili region was introduced to Western eyes as a result of visits and sketches made by French legionnaires, in particular a Lt. Brenans during the 1930s. On several of his expeditions, Lt. Brenans took French archaeologist Henri Lhote who went on to revisit sites in Algeria between 1956-1970 documenting and recording the images he found. Regrettably, some previous methods of recording and/or documenting have caused damage to the vibrancy and integrity of the images.

    title: Early rock art
    title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 4'
    body: The earliest pieces of rock art are engraved images reflecting a past vibrant
      fertile environment teeming with life and includes elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus
      and fish as well as numerous predators, giraffe, and plains animals such as
      antelope and gazelle. When human figures are depicted in this period they are
      very small in stature and hold throwing sticks or axes. More than simply hunting
      scenes, they are likely to reflect people’s own place within their environment
      and their relationship with it.

    title: Round Head Period
    title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 5'
    body: The area is especially famous for its Round Head paintings. Thought to be
      up to 9,000 years old, some of these paintings are the largest found on the
      African continent, measuring up to 13 feet in height. The Round Head period
      comprises depictions of figures with round, featureless heads and formless bodies,
      often appearing to be ‘floating’. Some features or characteristics of Round
      Head paintings found on the Tassili plateau are unique to the area, and the
      depiction of certain motifs may have held special significance locally, making
      particular sites where they occur the locus of rites, ritual or ceremonial activity.
      The majority of animal depictions are mouflon (wild mountain sheep) and antelope,
      but they are represented only in static positions and not as part of a hunting
      scene.

    body: The subsequent Pastoral Period, from around 7,500-4,000 years ago, portrays
      a very different world to the preceding ethereal Round Head period and coincides
      with the transition from a temperate Sahara towards aridification. Images are
      stylistically varied, which may attest to the movement of different cultural
      groups. Depictions now include domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, goats
      and dogs; scenes portray herders, men hunting with bows, and representations
      of camp life with women and children – in essence, scenes that reference more
      settled communities.

    title: Horse Period
    title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 7'
    body: |-
      Desertification across the Sahara required new methods of traversing and utilising the landscape; depictions of horses (often with riders) and of chariots indicate this change. Horse-drawn chariots are often depicted at a ‘flying’ gallop and are likely to have been used for hunting rather than warfare.

      Libyan-Berber script, used by ancestral Berber peoples, started to appear in association with images. However, the meaning of this juxtaposition of text and image remains an enigma, as it is indecipherable to modern day Tuareg.

      ancient river boats. Most of the published rock art is found in disparate geographical
      areas in the northern section of the country: around the Nile valley and close
      to the country''s north-western and north-eastern borders. Images include wild
      fauna such as antelope, domestic animals like camels, and depictions of boats,
      which along with inscriptions and religious imagery can attempt to date these

    title: Geography
    title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 2'
    body: Sudan covers nearly 2,000,000 km² and is geographically diverse, dominated
      in the north by the desert of the southern Sahara and divided by the River Nile,
      which flows north from the capital city of Khartoum at the confluence of the
      Blue and White Niles and is joined by the Atbara River in the east. East of
      the Nile is the arid Nubian Desert, which is part of the larger Sahara, flanked
      at the north east by the Red Sea Hills and at the south by clay plains. To the
      south and west of the country are semi-arid zones with seasonal watercourses,
      with the west dominated by the Jebel Marrah volcanic massif, and the Nuba mountain
      range near the southern border.

    title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 3'
    body: Historically, rock art research in Sudan has either been incorporated into
      larger investigations of the area’s rich archaeological history, or, as in the
      Nubian Nile valley, the result of archaeological salvage projects, aimed at
      documenting and conserving archaeological sites and artefacts in advance of
      engineered flooding events, such as the construction of the Aswan High dam in
      the 1960s and the Merowe dam in the early 2000s. This has resulted in significant
      rock art and rock gong discoveries, such as that noted near the Second Cataract
      (Žába, 1967) and more recently around the Fourth. Rock art remains vulnerable
      to damming initiatives – that at Sabu is currently under threat by the Kajbar
      Dam proposal at the Third Cataract. There is great scope for further research.

    title: Rock art types
    title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 4'
    body: |-
      The rock art of Sudan is varied across both time periods and geographical regions. Numerous pecked depictions of domestic cattle can be found in the Red Sea Hills (Pluskota, 2006) as well as depictions of both domestic and wild animals closer to the River Nile, such as those found at Jebel Gorgod in a mountainous area near Sesebi (Schiff Giorgini, 1972). Engravings, like those around the Second, Third, and Fourth Cataracts (areas of rocky rapids) are varied in subject matter and in date, ranging from Neolithic engravings of wild and domestic fauna to those with Medieval Christian imagery, for example around the Dal Cataract (Mills, 1965). These are mixed with others from about 4,000 BC onwards which may be contemporary with the Predynastic cultures and Pharaonic periods of ancient Egypt and in northern Sudan, Nubian Kerma culture (known to the ancient Egyptians as the Kingdom of Kush). These include depictions of Nile river boats and later hieroglyphic inscriptions.

      The peripatetic nature of these traceable signatures highlights the need to look beyond modern boundaries when considering ancient rock art traditions of Africa. For millennia prior to the creation of the current Egypt/Sudan border, the highway of the river allowed movement between Egypt and Nubia, the people of the region leaving their marks on a narrow area of fertile land that fostered riverine animals like crocodiles, which are occasionally depicted in the rock engravings. From the 4th millennium BC, following several temperate millennia, savannah animals like giraffe lost their habitat in the increasingly arid environments to east and west, but remain reflected in the rock engravings of what is now desert.

      The range in styles and dates for Sudanese rock art emphasises its nature, not as a particular artistic style, but as personal and cultural manipulations of a specific medium. A number of stone percussive instruments known as rock gongs, which produce a sonorous tone when struck and are often apparently associated with cattle engravings, have stimulated discussion about the uses of rock art sites as multisensory ritual venues.

    title: Chronology
    title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 5'
    body: The understanding of much of Sudanese prehistory as it relates to rock art
      remains subject to debate. Some of the best-preserved and most varied rock art
      of Sudan’s desert regions is situated only metres from the Egyptian border in
      the far north-west corner of the country, in a valley of Jebel Uweinat – the
      enormous sandstone and granite outcrop which serves as a boundary between Egypt,
      Sudan and Libya. Numerous paintings and engravings are found here, including
      images of wild animals, such as giraffe and antelope, humans, dogs and many
      cattle. Some of these paintings have been compared with other styles of rock
      art in the wider Sahara, including the later Pastoral Period (Muzzolini, 1995).
      Others have proposed that a different set of paintings in these sites may be
      older, with a stylistic link (although fragile) with the Round Head Period (Van
      Noten,1978). However, the scholarly community recognises the inherent difficulty
      of formulating conclusions of direct links with wider rock art practices. In
      areas around the Nile, where there are similar animal engravings, rock art is
      also from a wide range of time periods.

    body: 'Ascribing dates to rock art like that at Jebel Uweinat is also uncertain
      and is more difficult than dating images such as the depictions of Nile river
      boats or later Christian cross engravings like those found near the Third Cataract,
      where similar motifs are replicated on contemporary pottery and corroborated
      elsewhere in the archaeological record. Occasionally rock art may be found in
      a dateable stratigraphic context- a giraffe engraving at Gala Abu Ahmed in Wadi
      Howar, an ancient Nile tributary, was recently dated to before 1,200-1,300 BC
      in this way (Jesse, 2005). In general, other clues are necessary, for example
      known domestication dates: wild animal images are often superseded with depictions
      of animals like horses and camels. These were only widely known in northeast
      Africa from the second and first millennia BC respectively and are therefore
      unlikely to be older. However, this is not an exact science: examination of
      the superimpositions and levels of patination on some Nile valley cattle engravings
      show that they were made over thousands of years up to the not too distant past.
      Faced with such challenges, classifying rock art by design style, while problematic,
      can prove useful in envisioning chronology.'

    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 1'
    body: 'Rock art occurs in two main areas in Libya: the Tadrart Acacus and the
      Messak Plateau. The oldest works of rock art, from the Acacus Mountains, are
      engravings of mammals from the Wild Fauna Period (Early Hunter Period) and could
      be up to 12,000 years old. Thousands of paintings dating from up to 8,000-9,000
      years ago show a diversity of imagery and include scenes of hunting, pastoralism,
      daily life, dancing and a variety of wild and domesticated animals. The Messak
      Plateau is home to tens of thousands of engravings, and only a few paintings
      have been located in this region to date. The area is best known for larger-than-life-size
      engravings of animals such as elephants, rhino and bubalus (a now extinct buffalo),
      and some of the most iconic depictions in Saharan rock art, such as the ‘Fighting
      Cats’ scene.'

      art in the Acacus were formulated in the late 1930s by Italian archaeologist
      Paolo Graziosi. Subsequently, the region became the subject of systematic investigation
      by Fabrizio Mori, another Italian archaeologist, who also published the first
      scientific papers on Libyan rock art in the 1960s. Since then, consistent surveying
      has continued in this region and stratigraphic excavations of archaeological

    title: Chronology and early rock art
    title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 4'
    body: |-
      Rock art chronology in North Africa is based largely on the combination of stylistic features, superimposition, subject matter and the degree of weathering or patina. While not an exact science, chronological periods are recognisable in the depictions, which generally correspond to climatic and environmental phases. Some of the oldest images are found on the Messak plateau and represent a Sahara that was significantly wetter and more fertile than today, exemplified by representations of large mammals – some of which are aquatic species – incised into the rock faces.

      The chronology of the Tadrart Acacus during the Holocene has been established more firmly through the excavation and dating of archaeological sites. Based on this evidence, these earliest images may coincide with the first Holocene occupation of the area by specialised hunter-gatherers – known as the 'Early Acacus' Period – which some researchers date to around 11,000 years ago.

    title: Round Head Period
    title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 5'
    body: From around 9,000 years ago, the archaeological record in the Acacus changes;
      sites are larger, featuring more formalised stone structures with heavy grinding
      equipment and large pots. Subsistence strategies based on hunting and gathering
      remain, but archaeological evidence suggests the presence of corralling Barbary
      sheep and the storage of wild cereals. Fragments of grinding stones with traces
      of colour from the Takarkori rock shelter, dating from between 6,800–5,400 BC,
      may have been used as palettes for rock or body painting, and have been connected
      chronologically to the Round Head Period. A large proportion of paintings in
      this period portray very large figures with round, featureless heads and can
      often be depicted in ‘floating’ positions; women often have their hands raised,
      interpreted as postures of supplication.

    title: Pastoral Period
    title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 6'
    body: The introduction of domesticates into the region has been identified archaeologically
      at around 8,000 years ago, although full exploitation of cattle for dairying
      is much later at around 6,000 years ago. The development to full pastoral systems
      in the region is complex and prolonged, so it is challenging to track any changes
      from the rock art itself, but the painting of large herds must be connected
      to a full pastoral society.

    title: Horse and Camel Periods
    title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 7'
    body: |-
      Historical records have tended to date the introduction of both the horse and the camel in northern Africa rather than the archaeological record. Yet, in terms of rock art research in this region, less attention has been given to these styles; the reason for this may be that the earliest rock art attracted more scholarly consideration than the later depictions. However, their representation certainly demonstrates the changing natural and cultural environment and associated human responses and adaptations.

      The rock art of Libya is a visual testament to the changing fortunes of this part of the Sahara and the cultural groups who have occupied and navigated the area over thousands of years. The engravings and paintings act as a legacy, tracing the environmental effects of climate change, how people have adapted to that change and the cultural worlds they have created.

    body: 'Morocco is located at the north-western corner of Africa, in a unique area
      forming a link between the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, Europe and
      Africa. More than 300 rock art sites have been documented in the country so
      far, mainly located in two areas: the High Atlas Mountains, and the Sahara desert
      region to the south and east. They comprise mainly engravings, which could be
      up to 5,000 years old, and include domestic and wild animals, warriors, weapons
      and scenes of battles and hunting. Antelope and cattle are the most represented
      animals in Moroccan rock art, although elephants and rhinoceros are common too.'

    title: Geography and rock art distribution
    title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 2'
    body: Morocco has a very variable geography, with the Atlas Mountains crossing
      the country from the southwest to the northeast and separating the coastal plains
      to the west from the Sahara Desert that runs to the east and south. The distribution
      of rock art in the country is very irregular, with some zones crowded with sites
      and others almost devoid of depictions. The two main areas of rock art sites
      are the High Atlas zone and the area to the east and south of the Atlas Mountains.
      The first area groups more than seven thousand engravings around the Oukaïmeden
      valley, the Yagour plateau and the Jebel Rat site. They are at high altitude
      (more than 2000 metres above sea level), and mainly represent weapons, cattle
      and anthropomorphic figures, along with numerous geometric symbols.

      art sites are situated, contains the oldest engravings in the country, some
      of them linked to the Saharan styles. The variety of themes depicted is wide,

      This collection comprises about seven hundred images, most of them corresponding
      to the southern area of Morocco around the Draa valley and the town of Tata,

    title: Research history
    title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 4'
    body: 'European audiences began studying the rock art in Morocco decades after
      the study of rock art in Algeria and Libya, with the first news of rock art
      coming from French and German travellers late in the 19th century. The most
      significant boost came after the Treaty of Fes in 1912, when the presence of
      the colonial authorities led indirectly to an increasing knowledge of rock art
      sites, as Spanish and French officers started to show interest in the engravings.
      However, it was not until after Moroccan independence in 1956 that systematic
      research began throughout the country. Since then, archaeological information
      has progressively grown, although regional syntheses are still scarce: only
      the Atlas (Malhomme, Rodrigue) and part of southern Morocco (Simoneau) have
      exhaustive catalogues of sites. The first comprehensive study of Moroccan rock
      art was made in 2001 (Searight), when for the first time, a global approach
      to Moroccan rock art areas, themes and chronology was undertaken.'

      cattle, horses and different types of antelope. Many other animals, such as
      giraffes, elephants, rhinoceros, dromedaries or lions are depicted, if more
      scarcely. The second main theme is human figures, especially in the south of
      the country, where depictions of Libyan-Berber riders are very common. In the
      High Atlas area they are usually depicted isolated, surrounded by weapons, which
      are another big theme in Moroccan rock art: a panoply of these can be seen,
      including daggers, bows and arrows, spears, shields, axes and halberds.'

    title: Chronology
    title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 6'
    body: A consensus has yet to be achieved about Moroccan rock art chronology between
      the supporters of a long chronology, starting around 4000 BC, and those that
      defend a short one, from 2500 BC onwards. The oldest engravings represented
      in Moroccan rock art correspond to the Tazina and Pecked Cattle styles, depicting
      mainly mammals. From the second half of the second millennium BC onwards, depictions
      of human figures start to appear in the High Atlas, associated with daggers
      and shields, defining the so-called Dagger/Halberd/Anthropomorph style. During
      the first millennium BC, Libyan-Berber hunting and battle scenes start to appear
      in southern Morocco; riders, infantrymen and animals depicted in a very schematic
      style. The last period of Moroccan rock art, as in the rest of the Sahara, is
      the so-called Camel Period, characterized by the appearance of dromedaries.

    title: Geography and rock art distribution
    title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 2'
    body: |-
      In total Mauritania covers about 1,030,700 km², most of which forms part of the western portion of the Sahara desert. The southern part of Mauritania incorporates some of the more temperate Sahelian zone, forming part of the geographical and cultural border between Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa. The landscape of the country is generally characterised by its flatness, but the two major neighbouring plateaux in the East-Centre of the country – the Tagant in the South and the Adrar further North – are furnished with rock shelters, boulders and other surfaces upon which can be found abundant rock art, more often engraved than painted.

      The principal concentrations of rock art in Mauritania are located in these two areas, as well as in the North around Bir Moghreïn (in the Mauritanian extension of the Zemmur mountains), the Hank ridge near the borders of Algeria and Mali and the Tichitt-Walata area to the east of the Tagant plateau.

      __Adrar__

      There are about thirty known rock art sites in the Adrar region, although, as with most Mauritanian rock art, study has not been comprehensive and there may be many more as yet undocumented. Engraved rock art sites dominate along the northern edge of the massif, with some of the most significant to be found at the sites of El Beyyed and El Ghallaouiya. Rarer paintings of cattle are also to be found at El Ghallaouiya, as well as at the site of Amogjar.

      __Tagant__

      Less well studied than Adrar, the Tagant plateau contains several painting sites showing horses and riders such as those at the sites of Agneitir Dalma and Tinchmart. The archaeologically significant area of the Tichitt-Walata ridge, a chain of escarpments known for its Neolithic settlements, is largely located within the wider Tagant region to the east of the plateau, and also features many engravings and some paintings.

    title: Research history
    title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 3'
    body: |-
      Recording and research on Mauritanian rock art has been limited in comparison with other Saharan rock art traditions, and has mainly been undertaken by French scholars, as Mauritania was formerly part of French West Africa. The first major publications cataloguing rock art sites in the country were those of Théodore Monod (1937-8), based on recordings collected on expeditions made between 1934 and 1936 and covering the entire western Saharan region. Following this, the explorers Marion Senones and Odette du Puigaudeau published some paintings of the Tagant region in1939. A more comprehensive study of the paintings, engravings and inscriptions of West and North West Africa was made by Raymond Mauny (1954), and emphasised the importance of systematically recording and studying the images in their contexts. More recently (1993), Robert Vernet produced a synthesis of known Mauritanian rock art in his *Préhistoire de la Mauritanie*.

      Many individual Mauritanian rock art sites have also been recorded and published over the decades since the 1940s, particularly in the context of associated archaeological sites, such as those at Tegdaoust and in the Tichitt-Walata region.

    title: Themes
    title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 4'
    body: |-
      The range of subject matter in the rock art of Mauritania is similar to that of other Saharan countries, consisting primarily of images of domestic cattle, along with those of horses both mounted and unmounted, human figures and weaponry, wild fauna, hunting scenes, camels and Libyco-Berber/Tifinagh and Arabic script. Images of goats and sheep are extremely rare.

      Some general geographic tendencies in style and type can be made out, for example, deeply cut and polished naturalistic engravings of large wild animals are concentrated in the North of the country. There is an apparent North-South divide in engraving style, with images becoming more schematic further south. Rarer painting sites are clustered in certain areas such as north of Bir Moghreïn in the far north, and certain Adrar sites, with horse and rider paintings most common in the Tagant and Tichitt-Walata regions.

    body: |-
      Mauritanian rock art consists most commonly of similar-looking scenes of cattle, hunting tableaux, or camel depictions, but there are some exceptions of interest, for example: the monumental bull engraving from Akhrejit in the Dhar Tichitt, which is nearly 5 metres long; the unusually naturalistic paintings of cattle at Amogjar and Tenses in the Adrar; and the curiously shaped painted horses at Guilemsi in the Tagant-Titchitt region.

      In addition, although images of chariots apparently drawn by oxen are known elsewhere in the Sahara, chariots in Saharan rock art are normally associated with horses. In Mauritania, however, there are several images of ox chariots or carts – both painted and engraved – as well as depictions of cattle apparently bearing burdens/saddles, or mounted. Moreover, Mauritania has no known depictions of chariots where the draught animal is identifiably a horse, although there are many images of horses and riders. Sometimes chariots are depicted independent of any animals drawing them, and in all there are over 200 known images of chariots in the country.

    title: Chronology
    title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 6'
    body: 'As is the case with all Saharan rock art, sites found in Mauritania are
      very difficult to date, especially absolutely. Monod remarked: ‘it is impossible
      to propose even approximate dates: no landmark pinpoints the end of the Neolithic
      and the arrival of Libyan (Berber) horsemen’ (Monod, 1938, p.128). Relative
      chronologies of rock art styles are easier to identify than specific dates,
      as they may be based on visible elements such as superimpositions in paintings,
      and the darkness level of accrued patina in engravings. In Mauritania, researchers
      have generally paid particular attention to patina as well as themes and styles
      in order to try and place a timeframe on different rock art traditions. Even
      this is an inexact science – however, Monod did propose a three-phase chronology,
      with 1) ‘Ancient’ prehistoric rock art showing large wild fauna and cattle,
      2) ‘Middle’ pre-Islamic art showing horses, camels, riders, arms and armour,
      hunting scenes and Libyco-Berber script and 3) ‘Modern’ Islamic-era art with
      modern Tifinagh and Arabic inscriptions.'

    body: Mauny later proposed a more nuanced chronology, based also on style and
      technique, along the same lines as Monod’s. Mauny’s proposed divisions include
      a ‘naturalist’ period from 5,000–2,000 BC, a cattle pastoralist phase from 2,500–1,000
      BC, a horse period from 1,200 BC onwards, a ‘Libyco-Berber’ group from 200 BC–700
      AD and a final ‘Arabo-Berber’ phase from 700 AD onwards (Mauny, 1954). While
      the oldest rock art, such as the paintings at Amogjar, could be more than 5,000
      years old, it appears that most Mauritanian rock art probably post-dates 2,000
      BC, with some, particularly that involving camels, made within the last 2,000
      years.

      is helpful in ascribing dates and authorship to some of the rock art. The time
      period over which rock art was produced in Mauritania coincided with dramatic
      changes in the climate and the desertification of the Sahara, which settled
      at present levels of aridity following increased dry periods: around 1,500 BC
      in the North, and by the mid-1st Millenium AD in the South. There is some evidence
      for a combination of hunting and pastoral activity in the North-East prior to
      the desertification, with pastoralism becoming an important means of subsistence
      in the South after 2,000 BC.'

    body: The first solid archaeological evidence for horses this far west is from
      about 600 AD. However, horses and chariots could have been introduced over a
      thousand years before, possibly by early Berber peoples from the North, who
      are thought to have made increased incursions from the 4th Millennium onwards,
      and with whom much of the rock art is usually associated. Chariot images can
      be reasonably assumed to date from the time we know chariots were in use in
      the Sahara – i.e. not earlier than 1,200 BC.

    title: Interpretation
    title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 10'
    body: 'Generally, the study of Mauritanian rock art traditions has focused more
      on cataloguing the images and categorising them by style, technique and perceived
      age than investigating their potential cultural significance. The limitations
      in the ability to scientifically date these images, and the fact that they are
      not usually associated with other archaeological materials, hinders effective
      attempts at interpretation or ascribing authorship, beyond basic ‘Neolithic’
      ‘pastoralist’, or ‘early Berber’. Even this may not be clear-cut or mutually
      exclusive: for example, incoming Berber peoples in the Adrar Plateau after 2,000
      BC are thought to have been cattle pastoralists, as their non-Berber predecessors
      probably were. In addition, while the desertification process was definitive
      from this time on, fluctuations and regional microclimates made pastoralism
      viable relatively recently in some areas – in the Adrar there is still evidence
      of cattle rearing as late as 1,000 BC or after, and some areas of the Tagant
      region may have been able to support cattle as late as the 18th century. Thus
      subject matter alone is not necessarily indicative of date or authorship: depictions
      of cattle may be Berber or non-Berber, as old as the 4th millennium BC or as
      recent as the 1st, if not later.'

    body: It is possible to make some more specific inferences based on style. Some
      of the more naturalistic cattle paintings from the Adrar have been compared
      in style to the Bovidian style paintings of the Tassili n’Ajjer in Libya, and
      some of the more geometric designs to others in Senegal and Mali. Links have
      also been suggested between some cattle and symbolic images and modern Fulani
      and Tuareg traditions and iconography. In terms of significance, changes to
      rock art style over time, from naturalistic to schematic, have been remarked
      upon as perhaps somehow reflecting environmental changes from savannah to steppe
      and desert. It has also been debated whether some of the geometric symbols and
      images of riders on horseback were the result of conflict, perhaps made by the
      victims of Berber invasions as catharsis or to ward off evil.

      the history and prehistory of Mauritania. It is also an endangered resource,
      due to a combination of environmental factors, such as extremes of temperature
      which damage and split the rocks, and human interference from looting and vandalism.

    title_internal: 'Chad: country, chapter 1'
    body: 'Located in the centre of North Africa, landlocked Chad stretches from the
      Sahara Desert in the north to the savannah in the south. The country boasts
      thousands of rock engravings and paintings located in two main areas: the Ennedi
      Plateau and the Tibesti Mountains, both to the north. The depictions – the oldest
      of which date back to the fifth millennium BC – represent wild animals, cattle
      and human figures. Paintings of highly detailed riders on camels and horses
      are especially numerous, as are groups of people around huts. Chadian rock art
      is particularly well known for its variety of local styles, and it includes
      some of the richest examples of Saharan rock art.'

    title: Geography and rock art distribution
    title_internal: 'Chad: country, chapter 2'
    body: 'The north-south orientation of Chad''s elongated shape means it is divided
      into several different climatic zones: the northern part belongs to the Sahara
      Desert, while the central area is included in the Sahel border (the semi-arid
      region south of the Sahara). The southern third of the country is characterized
      by a more fertile savannah. The Ennedi Plateau and Tibesti mountains contain
      thousands of pieces of rock art, including some of the most famous examples
      in the Sahara. The Ennedi Plateau is located at the north-eastern corner of
      Chad, on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. It is a sandstone massif carved
      by erosion in a series of superimposed terraces, alternating plains and ragged
      cliffs crossed by wadis (seasonal rivers). Unlike other areas in the Sahara
      with rock art engravings or paintings, the Ennedi Plateau receives rain regularly
      – if sparsely – during the summer, making it a more benign environment for human
      life than other areas with significant rock art to the north, such as the Messak
      plateau or the Tassili Mountains in Libya and Algeria.'

    title: Research history
    title_internal: 'Chad: country, chapter 4'
    body: |-
      Different areas of Chad have been subject to varying trajectories of research. In the Tibesti Mountains, rock art was known to Europeans as early as 1869, although it was between the 1910s and 1930s that the first studies started to be carried out, by François D’Alverny. However, the main boost in research came in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to the work of Paul Huard. Over the last 50 years, researchers have found thousands of depictions throughout the region, most of them engravings, although paintings are also well represented.

      In the case of the Ennedi Plateau, its isolated position far from the main trade routes made its rock art unknown outside the area until the 1930s. During this decade, Burthe d’Annelet brought attention to the art, and De Saint-Floris published the first paper on the subject. The main effort to document this rock art came in 1956-1957, when Gerard Bailloud recorded more than 500 sites in only a sixth of the plateau's entire area.

    title: Themes
    title_internal: 'Chad: country, chapter 5'
    body: As in the rest of the Sahara, the main themes in Chadian rock art are directly
      linked to the chronology. The oldest depictions are of wild animals, but most
      common are later scenes with cattle, huts and people. As in other areas of the
      Sahara, the most recent depictions correspond to battle scenes of riders on
      horses and camels. Along with these main subjects, both areas have examples
      of very detailed scenes of daily life and human activities, including people
      playing music, visiting the sick or dancing. The rock art of both the Ennedi
      Plateau and the Tibesti regions is characterized by the existence of a variety
      of local styles, such as the so-called ‘Flying Gallop style’, sometimes simultaneous,
      sometimes successive. This variability means an enormous richness of techniques,
      themes and artistic conventions, with some of the most original styles in Saharan
      rock art.

    title_internal: 'Chad: country, chapter 6'
    body: |-
      The oldest engravings in Chad are more recent than those to the north, having started to appear in the 5th to 4th millennia BC, and can be broadly divided into three main periods:

      The oldest is the so-called Archaic Period, characterized by wild animals in the Ennedi Plateau and Round Head-style figures in the Tibesti Mountains, similar to those found in the Central Sahara. The second phase is named the Bovine or Pastoral Period, when domestic cattle are the predominant animals, and a third, late period named the Dromedary or Camel Period. Unlike other areas in the Sahara, horse and camel depictions appear to be from roughly the same period (although horses were introduced to the Sahara first), so they are included in a generic Camel Period. The end of the rock art tradition in both areas is difficult to establish, but it seems to have lasted at least until the seventeenth century in the Ennedi Plateau, much longer than in other areas of the Sahara.

    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 1'
    body: Rock art is distributed widely throughout Kenya, although historically rock
      art research has not been as extensive as in neighbouring countries such as
      Tanzania. Some of Kenya's various rock art traditions are attributed to or associated
      with the ancestors of modern regional cultural groups, and as such sites sometimes
      retain local religious importance. Both painted and engraved imagery tends towards
      the symbolic and geometric, with occasional depictions of schematic animals
      and people. It must be noted that there are still probably many Kenyan rock
      art sites which have not yet become known outside of their local communities,
      if they are known at all.

    title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 2'
    body: Kenya covers about 569,140km², bordering Ethiopia and Somalia in the north
      and east and Tanzania and Uganda in the south and west. The country stretches
      from a low-lying eastern coastal strip, inland to highland regions in the west
      of the country. Kenya's western half is divided by the eastern section of the
      East African Rift, the long area of tectonic divergence which runs from the
      coasts of Djibouti, Eritrea and Somalia down through Ethiopia and Kenya and
      into Uganda, curving around the eastern edge of the Lake Victoria basin. There
      are a significant number of painted rock art sites throughout west-central and
      southern Kenya.

    title: Research history
    title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 3'
    body: 'Although researchers had been noting and investigating rock art in the
      neighbouring countries of Tanzania and Uganda from the early years of the 20th
      Century, the first published mention of Kenyan rock art appeared only in 1946,
      with Joy Adamson''s descriptions of engravings at Surima, in the northern Turkana
      region. It was in the 1960s that sustained academic attention began to be paid
      to other sites in the country. In 1961 Richard Wright published an account of
      a rock shelter (now known as Kiptogot Cave) with painted images of cattle on
      the slopes of Mount Elgon near Kitale. Wright suggested potential parallels
      in style with some Ethiopian pastoralist rock art. In 1968 Robert Soper was
      the first archaeologist to investigate the unique Namoratung’a burial sites
      to the east of Lake Turkana, with their engraved standing stones, the interpretation
      of which would be continued with the work of Mark Lynch and Lawrence Robbins
      in the 1970s. In the same decade significant painting sites at Lake Victoria,
      north of the lake near the Ugandan border, and in the far south were also reported
      on by James Chaplin, Osaga Odak and Richard Gramly. Research and discovery has
      continued and is likely that many rock art sites in Kenya remain to be documented.
      As recently as 2005, 21 previously unknown rock art sites in the Samburu area
      of central Kenya were recorded during dedicated survey work organised by the
      British Institute in East Africa.    '

    title: Themes
    title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 4'
    body: "Figurative imagery only features prominently in about 10% of the known
      rock art sites of Kenya.  That which exists tends to consist of very schematic
      images of cattle, wild animals and people. The majority of both painted and
      engraved rock art iconography throughout Kenya comprises symbols, with common
      patterns including circles, sometimes concentric or containing crosses, spirals,
      parallel or cross-hatched lines and curvilinear shapes.  Circular ground  depressions
      in the rock surface, known as cupules, are also a common variant of rock art
      in Kenya, along with rock gongs, which show evidence of the use of natural rock
      formations as percussive instruments.\n\nInterpretation, cultural attribution
      and proposed dates for these works vary widely across technique and area, although
      there are common themes.  It has been suggested that the schematic nature and
      similarities in the art may point to shared East African symbolic understandings
      common to different cultural groups, for example equating circular shapes (some
      of the most popular motifs in Eastern and Central African rock art in general)
      with chieftainship or the sun, or acting as navigation devices.\n\nGiven the
      variations in distance, age and nature of the sites, there is a danger of generalising,
      but there are factors which may contribute to more incisive interpretations
      of specific sites and symbols.  One set of interpretations for geometric shapes
      in Kenyan rock art points to the similarities of certain of these symbols to
      cattle brands used by Nilotic peoples throughout Kenya, including the Turkana,
      Samburu and Masai groups.  Although the engravings at Namoratung'a are not thought
      to have been made by ancestral Turkana people, Lynch and Robbins noted the similarities
      of some of the symbols found there to contemporary local Turkana cattle brands.
      \ These symbols are pecked on stones at graves containing mens’ remains and
      have been proposed to represent male lineages, as animal brands traditionally
      do in contemporary Nilotic ethnic groups. Further south, it is known that some
      more recent rock paintings representing brand and shield patterns were made
      by  Masai and Samburu men, in shelters used for meat-feasting—a  practice forbidden
      in their home compounds after their formal initiation as warriors—or as initiation
      sites. Actual representations of cattle are rare, with the vibrant paintings
      at Kakapel near the Ugandan border the most reknowned. Their creators are unknown
      although Masai and Samburu have been known to paint occasional schematic cattle
      in the past.    \n"

    title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 5'
    body: Not all of Kenya's rock art is associated with pastoralists. Much of the
      symbolic art, particularly to the south and west, is attributed to the ’Batwa’,
      ancestors of modern Batwa and related, traditionally hunter-gatherer cultural
      groups living around the Great Lakes Region of East and Central Africa.  Circular
      designs and “Sunburst” symbols are some of the most common motifs usually  associated
      with the Batwa rock art tradition; it has been proposed that they may have been
      associated  with fertility or rainmaking. Some rock art on Mfangano Island,
      in the Kenyan portion of Lake Victoria, has retained the latter association,
      having been used until the recent past by local Abasuba people for rainmaking
      purposes, despite their not having produced it originally. This re-use of symbolic
      sites in Kenya and the difficulty of dating further confuses the question of
      attribution for the art. The same rock art sites used by different cultural
      groups at different times and for different reasons. Such is the case at Kakapel
      for example, where it is posited that the earliest paintings may be hunter-gatherer
      in origin, with more recent cattle images added later, and Namoratung’a, with
      some engravings apparently hundreds of years old and others made within the
      last century.

    title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 6'
    body: It is instructive to consider the use of rock art sites within their physical
      contexts as well as the rock art motifs themselves.  Locality and landscape
      are significant, for example at Namoratung’a, where the engraved basalt pillars
      at a related nearby site have been posited to be positioned according to astronomical
      calculations, based on an ancient Cushitic calendar.  There are various ways
      in which the creation and continued use of sites in Kenya may have been significantly
      interactive, such as in the ritual playing of rock gongs, or in the potential
      use of rows of cupules as gaming boards for forms of Mancala, a token game common
      through central and Southern Africa which was originally introduced to Kenya
      via Indian Ocean trade.  It is not known if cupules were actually created for
      this purpose—it has been suggested for example that  in some areas, cupules
      were formed for purely practical purposes, in the pulverising of food or materials
      for smelting activities. In Kenya, as elsewhere, what actually constitutes rock
      art is not always easy to identify.

    title: Chronology
    title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 7'
    body: "Rock art ascribed to Batwa peoples could be anywhere between 15,000-1,000
      years old, while pastoralist art is more recent.  Radiocarbon dating of rock
      art is difficult unless it is buried and associated with other uncontaminated
      organic remains and as such, scientifically dated rock art from Kenya is rare.
      \ Radiocarbon dates from human remains in graves at Namoratung’a South date
      from the mid-1st Century BC to the mid-1st Millennium AD, but as dates like
      these are not directly relatable to the rock art, researchers have tended to
      concentrate on assigning chronologies based on varying levels of patination
      and style, without being able to ascribe more than estimated production dates.
      \ \n\nThere are occasionally defining limits which aid in dating  specific sites,
      for example, cattle did not arrive in Eastern Africa until about 2,000 BC, so
      representations of cattle must postdate this.  In addition, in some cases, artworks
      known to have been associated with certain groups cannot have been produced
      prior to, or post, certain dates for political reasons. For example, Masai paintings
      at Lukenya Hill are known to have been painted prior to 1915, as Masai people
      were displaced from this area by European settlers after this date.  \n\nThe
      diversity of Kenyan rock art in motif, distribution and cultural context so
      far frustrates any attempts for a cohesive chronology, but the continuing local
      engagement with rock art sites in Kenya can potentially serve as a useful dating
      and interpretive resource for researchers alongside continuing archaeological
      research."

    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 1'
    body: Somalia is a country located at the corner of the Horn of Africa, bordered
      by Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya. Somaliland self-declared independence from
      Somalia in 1991 although the government of Somalia has not recognised this and
      views it as an autonomous region. A cultural and economic crossroads between
      Middle East, Africa and Asia, this area has historically been the centre of
      trade routes that linked these regions. It also has a very rich rock art heritage
      which has only recently been started to be studied in depth. Most of the known
      depictions correspond to painted or engraved cattle scenes, often accompanied
      by human figures, dogs and other domestic animals, although some warriors, camels
      and geometric symbols (sometimes interpreted as tribal marks) are common too.

    title: Geography and rock art distribution
    title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 2'
    body: 'The geography of Somaliland is characterized by a coastal semi-desert plain
      which runs parallel to the Gulf of Aden coast, crossed by seasonal rivers (wadis)
      which make possible some grazing during the rainy season. Farther to the south,
      this semi-desert plain gives rise to the Karkaar Mountains. These mountains,
      which run from Somaliland into the region of Puntland in Somalia, have an average
      height of 1800 meters above sea level and run west to east until Ras Caseyr
      (Cape Guardafui) where the north and east coasts of the Horn of Africa meet.
      Southward to the mountains there is a big, dry plateau known as the Ogo, whose
      western part (the Haud) is one of the few good grazing areas in the country.
      The Ogo plateau occupies much of central and eastern Somalia, which to the south
      is characterized by the two only permanent rivers in the country, the Jubba
      and the Shabeele, born in the Ethiopian highlands and running to the south.
      Regarding rock art, the distribution of the known rock art sites shows a high
      concentration in Somaliland, with only some sites located to the south in the
      Gobolka Hiiraan region. However, this distribution could be a result of lack
      of research in other areas. '

    title: Research history
    title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 3'
    body: A reconstruction of rock art research history is challenging due to its
      contemporary history. To begin with, during the colonial period the country
      was divided in three different territories (British, Italian and French) with
      very different trajectories, until 1960 when the British and Italian territories
      joined to create Somalia. In British Somaliland the first studies of rock art
      were carried out by Miles Burkitt and P.E. Glover in the 1940s, and the first
      general overview was published in 1954 by J.D. Clark, as a part of a regional
      synthesis of the Horn of Africa prehistory, followed by limited research done
      by Italians in the north-east region in the late 1950s. Since then, research
      has been limited, with some general catalogues published in the 1980s and 1990s,
      although political instability has often prevented research, especially in the
      south-eastern region of Somalia. In fact, most rock art information comes from
      wider regional syntheses dedicated to the Horn of Africa.  In the early 2000’s
      the discovery of the Laas Geel site led to a renewed interest in rock art in
      Somaliland, which has allowed a more systematic study of archaeological sites.
      Nowadays, about 70 of these sites have been located only in this area, something
      which shows the enormous potential of rock art studies in the Horn of Africa.

    title: Themes
    title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 4'
    body: The rock art has traditionally been ascribed to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabican
      style, a term coined by Pavel Červiček in 1971 to remark the strong stylistic
      relationship between the rock art found in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian
      Peninsula. According to this proposal, there was a progressive evolution from
      naturalism to schematism, perceptible in the animal depictions throughout the
      region. Wild animals seem to be largely absent but for Djibouti, while cattle
      depictions seem to have been fundamental elsewhere, either isolated or in herds.
      Such is the case with rock art in this region, where cows and bulls are the
      most common depictions, in many cases associated to human figures in what seems
      to be reverential or ritual scenes. In some of the sites, such as Laas Geel,
      the necks of the cows have been decorated with complex geometric patterns interpreted
      as a kind of mat used in special occasions to adorn them.

    body: Along with cattle, other animals were represented (humped cows or zebus,
      dogs, sheep, dromedaries), although to a much lesser extent. Wild animals are
      very rare, but giraffes have been documented in Laas Geel and elephants and
      antelopes in Tug Gerbakele, and lions are relatively common in the schematic,
      more modern depictions. Human figures also appear, either distributed in rows
      or isolated, sometimes holding weapons. Geometric symbols are also common, usually
      associated with other depictions. In Somalia, these symbols have often been
      interpreted as tribal or clan marks. With respect to techniques, both engraving
      and painting are common, although paintings seem to be predominant.

    title: Chronology
    title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 6'
    body: As in many other places, the establishment of accurate chronologies for
      Somaliland rock art is challenging. In this case, the lack of long term research
      has made things more difficult, and most hypotheses have been based in stylistic
      approaches, analysis of depictions and a small set of radiocarbon data and archaeological
      excavations. According to this, the oldest depictions could be dated to between
      the mid-3rd and the 2rd millennium BC, although older dates have been proposed
      for Laas Geel. This phase would be characterized by humpless cows, sheep and
      goats as well as wild animals. These sites would indicate the beginning of domestication
      in this region, the cattle being as a fundamental pillar of these communities.
      From this starting point the relative antiquity of the depictions would be marked
      by a tendency to schematism, visible in the superimpositions of several rock
      art sites. The introduction of camels would mark a chronology of the end of
      the first millennium BC, while the date proposed for the introduction of zebus
      (humped cows) should be placed at between the 1st Centuries BC and AD.

      start to appear alongside the cattle, in some cases distributed in rows and
      depicting fighting scenes against other warriors or lions. The moment when this
      last period of rock art ended is unknown, but in nearby Eritrea some of these
      figures were depicted with firearms, thus implying that they could have reached
      a relatively modern date.

    title_internal: 'Uganda: country, chapter 1'
    body: Rock art in Uganda is mostly concentrated in the eastern part of the country,
      but more broadly sits within a regional belt of geometric rock art spanning
      East and Central Africa. It is mainly geometric in nature and includes both
      paintings (red and white being the most common pigment) and engravings; it comprises
      a basic and recurring repertoire of shapes including circular, rectangular,
      sausage, dot and lines. Concentric circles with rays emanating from them are
      a unique feature of Ugandan rock art.

      of the Great Lakes region, flanked by Lake Edward, Lake Albert and Lake Victoria,
      the latter being the second largest inland freshwater lake in the world, containing
      numerous islands. While much of its border is lakeshore, the country is landlocked.  Predominantly
      plateau, Uganda is cradled by mountains with Margherita peak (5,199m) on Mount

    title: Research History
    title_internal: 'Uganda: country, chapter 4'
    body: |-
      The first documentation of rock art in Uganda occurred in 1913 (Teso Report) at Nyero, a painted rock shelter of the Later Iron Age period. After its initial recording the site was subsequently cited in a 1945 excavation report (Harwich, 1961) and meticulously noted by J.C.D Lawrance during the 1950s. Only a small number of studies of Ugandan rock art rock art have been published (Wayland 1938; Lawrance 1953; Posnansky 1961; Morton 1967; Chaplin 1974), with early analyses being predominantly descriptive and highly speculative.

      The first major publications on Ugandan rock art emerged in the 1960s (Posnansky 1961; Morton 1967; Chaplin 1974) with rock art researchers proposing that the geometric and non-representational depictions served a documentary purpose of identifying cultural groups such as hunter-gatherers, cultivators or pastoralists. During this decade researchers attempted to place the rock art in a chronological framework, tying it to broader archaeological sequences. Political instability greatly impeded research during the 1970s and 1980s, although Chaplin’s thesis and in-depth survey on prehistoric rock art of Lake Victoria was published posthumously in 1974.

      the red animal tradition that comprises finely painted representations of animals
      in red pigment painted in a figurative style. These are all in the far north-eastern
      corner of Uganda. Antelope are the most common animals depicted, but this imagery

      the majority are highly distorted and difficult to identify to species level,
      and are associated with rows of dots superimposing the animal forms. The second
      tradition, the red geometrics include images painted in red and applied with
      the fingertip; the most common motifs comprise concentric circles, concentric
      circles with radiating lines, dots, U-shapes, dotted, straight, horizontal and
      vertical lines and interlinked lines. Other motifs and shapes are described
      as ‘acacia pod’, ‘canoes’, and ‘dumbbell’; a testament to the problems researchers
      face when attempting to use descriptive terms in identifying complex designs.
      \n\n__Engravings__\n\nGeometric engravings occur in and around Lake Victoria
      and also in north-eastern Uganda. Motifs comprise concentric circles, grids,
      concentric circles with internal radiating spokes, lines and dots. Proportionally,
      there are fewer engravings than paintings but as Namono (2010) has observed
      this may reflect a research bias rather than an actual disparity.\n"

    body: |-
      Attempts to understand the chronology of Ugandan rock in the 1960s were based on sequences focusing on pigments used in paintings. Lawrance proposed that yellow paintings were the oldest; followed by orange, red, purple, red and white; white and dirty white were the latest in the sequence. It is highly problematic developing sequences based on pigments because of the ways in which they chemically react with particular surfaces, other pigments and the natural elements, which can compromise the integrity of the pigment. However, there appears to be a consistency (across East and Central Africa) that suggests red and white geometric paintings are the oldest and have been in existence for millennia.

      Initially thought to be the work of San Bushmen of southern Africa, archaeological, genetic and ethnographic evidence has subsequently attributed the paintings to the Batwa people, a cultural group who are today found in small groups near the Rwanda/Uganda border. If it is accepted that the geometric imagery was made by these hunter-gatherers then the rock art of Uganda probably dates from between 12,000 to 1,000 years ago.

    body: However, more recent studies have proposed that these were the work of settled
      human groups and not early hunter-gatherers. Radiocarbon dating at Nyero (and
      another site at Kakoro) has dated the paintings to between 5,000 and 1,600 years
      ago. It has been proposed that rock shelters were used by semi-nomadic peoples
      engaged in animal herding, which they used as reference points in the landscape.
      Generally positioned away from flat land, they may have served to direct herders
      of cattle and/or goats towards paths and water.

    title: Interpretation
    title_internal: 'Uganda: country, chapter 11'
    body: A recent comprehensive study (Namono, 2010) of the potential meaning of
      geometric art in Uganda looked at the ways in which the geometric shapes in
      the rock art can be associated with the ethnographies of hunter-gatherers of
      the region. The approach proposed that the symbolism of geometric rock art derives
      from a gendered forest worldview. The forest is pivotal to hunter/gatherer cosmology
      in this region, whereby it plays a central role in cultural production and reproduction
      over time and is regarded as both male and female. The forest is not only a
      source of subsistence and well-being but informs their identity and the rock
      art reflects these complex concepts.

    title: Geography and Rock Art distribution
    title_internal: Tanzania Chapter 2
    body: |-
      Situated within the Great Lakes Region of East Africa, Tanzania is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and the Indian Ocean to the east, with a coastline of approx. 800km. At 947,303 km², Tanzania is the largest country in East Africa and is home to Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro (5,895 m, 19,340 feet), located in the north-east of the country.

      Central Tanzania is comprised largely of a plateau, which is mainly grassland and contains many national parks. The north of the country is predominantly arable and includes the national capital of Dodoma. The north-east of the country is mountainous and contains the eastern arm of the Great Rift Valley. Further north-west is Lake Victoria adjoining the Kenya–Uganda–Tanzania border. Concentrations of rock art are found mainly in the Kondoa province of central Tanzania and also the Lake Eyasi Basin in the north of the country.


      The rock art of the Lake Eyasi Basin and that of Kondoa share many similarities related to subject matter, styles, pigments and even types of sites. This may possibly reflect a shared art tradition among hunter-gatherers, which is feasible as there are no natural barriers preventing the movement of cultural ideas and techniques.

    title: History of rock art research in Tanzania
    title_internal: Tanzania Chapter 3
    body: 'The existence of painted rock art was first reported  to Europeans in 1908
      by missionaries, but the first scientific explorations date back to the 1930s.
      Early surveys were undertaken by Ludwig Kohl-Larsen (1958), a German physician,
      amateur anthropologist and explorer, who traced images in more than 70 rock
      shelters in 1935. The renowned paleoanthropologists Mary and Louis Leakey (1983)
      were the first to extensively study the rock art of Tanzania during the 1930s
      and 1950s (having noted many sites in the 1920s), documenting over 1600 painted
      images at 186 sites north of Kondoa. In the late 1970s and during the 1980s
      Fidelis Masao (1979) surveyed 68 rock paintings sites and excavated four of
      them while Emmanuel Anati (1996) recorded 200 sites in Kondoa. Other researchers
      include Eric ten Raa (1971, 1974), David Lewis-Williams (1986), Imogene Lim
      (1992), and Emmanuel Bwasiri (2008, 2011); all of whom have recorded numerous
      sites, contributing to identifying chronologies, styles and possible interpretations.
      Conservation and preservation of the rock art has been of importance since the
      1930s, and many of the paintings recorded by the Leakeys in the early 1950s
      are now severely deteriorated, or in some cases completely destroyed. '

    title: Chronologies
    title_internal: Tanzania Chapter 4
    body: "Scholars have classified the rock art in Tanzania into three main stylistic
      groups:  Hunter-gatherer, also known as Sandawe, Pastoral, and Late Whites.
      Hunter-gatherer and Late White paintings are often found in the same rock shelters
      and in some instances, all three types occur at the same site. \n\nNo paintings
      have been scientifically dated, but some researchers have proposed the earliest
      dates for the art: Anati (1996) has suggested paintings at Kondoa may be up
      to 40,000 years old; Leakey (1985) and Coulson and Campbell (2001) up to 10,000
      years old. Masao (1979) has estimated the earliest art at perhaps 3000 years
      old. These are estimates and not based on radiometric dating techniques, and
      as the paintings have been exposed to considerable weathering these very early
      dates currently cannot be substantiated.\n\n__Hunter-gatherer__\n\nHunter-gatherer
      or Sandawe rock art is characterised by fine-line paintings and includes images
      of animals, human figures, handprints and circular designs. These are the earliest
      paintings, thought to date to between 3,000-10,000 years ago, and are attributed
      to the ancestral Sandawe, a hunter-gatherer group indigenous to north-east Tanzania.
      \n\nThis tradition of rock art occurs in the Kondoa region, with just a few
      hundred sites in a concentration of less than a 100km in diameter and corresponding
      closely to the known distribution of the Sandawe people. Animals, such as giraffe,
      elephant, rhinoceros, antelope, plus a few birds and reptiles, dogs and possibly
      bees, make up more than half of the images depicted. In addition there are a
      few animal tracks depicted: cloven hooves, porcupine and aardvark.  \n"

      Typically, human figures are slender and elongated, wearing large elaborate coiffures or headdresses, and sometimes with animal heads.  Occasionally they are bent at the waist but they always appear in groups or pairs. A few of the figures are painted with bows and arrows and occur with animals, although whether these represent a hunting scene is uncertain. Women are very scarce. The few handprints present are painted depictions rather than stencils and circular designs are made up of concentric circles sometimes with elaborate rays and occasional rectangles and finger dots.

      __Pastoral__

      About 3,000 years ago, Cushitic herders from Ethiopia moved into the region, and were followed by Nilotic cattle pastoralists, ancestors of today’s Maasai. In comparison to hunter-gatherer rock art, Pastoral rock art yields many fewer paintings and generally depicts cattle in profile, and sometimes sheep and/or goats, a few dogs and figures holding sticks and bows. Predominantly painted in black and sometimes red and white, the colour of many images has now faded to a dull grey colour.

      __Late White__

      Late White paintings are crude, finger painted images and often superimpose older images. These were made by Bantu-speaking, iron-working farmers who moved into the region in the last 300-500 years.  The most common type of depiction are designs and motifs that include circles, some of which have rays emanating outwards,  concentric circles, patterns of dots and grids with outlines, what look like stick figures with multiple arms, as well as handprints. Animal depictions include giraffe, elephant, antelope, snakes, reptiles, baboons and domestic species. Human figures are less common, but when present are notably men facing forwards with hands on hips, sometimes holding weapons.

      Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. It stretches from north to south with the eastern
      boundary of the country marked by the Lake Malawi. Rock art can be found throughout
      the country but is especially abundant in central Malawi, near the western border
      with Mozambique. It consists exclusively of paintings attributed to two very
      distinctive groups (hunter-gatherers and farmers), and shows obvious links with
      other sites located in Zambia and western Mozambique. The images consist mainly
      of animals, anthropomorphic figures and geometric symbols, with a chronology
      that ranges from the Late Stone Age to the 1950s.  \n"

      Nyasa). Almost 600 km long and more than 50 km wide, Lake Malawi is the second
      biggest lake in Africa and a key geographical feature of Malawi and the surrounding
      countries, as well as an important economic resource for the country. The rest
      of the country west of the Rift Valley is dominated by high plateaus, mostly
      ranging from 900-1200 m above sea level but reaching 2500 m in the Nyika Plateau
      to the north and 3000 m at Mt. Mulanje, to the south. The climate is equatorial,
      with strong seasonal differences, and hotter in the southern part of the country. '

    body: 'Although rock art can be found in several areas in Malawi, the main concentration
      of sites is located in the Chongoni area, in the westernmost part of central
      Malawi, very near the border with Mozambique. In that area around 150 rock art
      sites have been located so far, belonging to the two main traditions of rock
      art found in the country. Other smaller concentrations of rock art can be found
      to the south and to the north-west, and around the southern side of Lake Malawi.
      The distribution of the different styles of Malawian rock art varies substantially:
      while the older paintings attributed to hunter-gatherers can be found everywhere
      throughout the country, those made by farmers are concentrated in the Chongoni
      area, as well as nearby areas of Mozambique and Zambia. Rock art is usually
      scattered throughout the landscape, in hilly areas where gneiss outcrops provide
      shelters and well-protected surfaces adequate for painting.  '

    body: 'Rock art in Malawi has been documented by Europeans since at least the
      1920s, although it wasn’t until the 1950s when the first articles on the subject
      were published, and it was only in 1978 a first synthesis on Malawian rock art
      was undertaken (Lindgren, N.E.  & Schoffeleers, J.M. 1978). In the 1980s research
      increased, especially on Chongoni rock art as its importance as a secret society
      artefact became evident. In 1995 the Chongoni rock art area was comprehensively
      studied by Benjamin Smith as a part of his doctoral research (1995), which is
      still the main reference on the topic. Most of the research on Malawi rock art
      has focused on the study of the two different painting traditions found in Malawi.
      A basic proposal was made in 1978 when the red paintings—mostly geometric—considered
      older and attributed to hunter-gatherers, while white paintings were related
      to more modern groups of farmers which arrived early in the 2nd millennium AD
      and preserved their painting traditions until the 1950s. Since 1978, the knowledge
      of these two groups has substantially improved, with a more refined proposal
      made by Benjamin Smith in his doctoral dissertation.  '

      schematic paintings with parallels in Central Africa from Malawi to Angola.
      These paintings are associated with the ancestors of modern Batwa hunter-gatherers,
      and can be classified into two different types. The first can be considered
      the most characteristic and is represented by circles with radiating lines,
      concentric circles, ovals, wavy or parallel lines. In some cases, red figures
      are infilled in white painting or white dots. The second type is very scarce
      (only two examples have been found in Chongoni) and depicts very schematic animals,
      sometimes accompanied by humans. Both types are finely executed with red oxide
      pigment. Regarding their interpretation, the figures seem to have been associated

    title_internal: 'Malawi: country, chapter 7'
    body: 'The second and more modern rock art tradition found in Malawi is represented
      by white figures made with white clay daubed onto rock surfaces with the finger.
      Associated with the agriculturalist Chewa people, the depictions usually represent
      zoomorphic, spread-eagled or snake-like figures which could represent mythological
      beings, sometimes accompanied by geometric symbols.  As in the case of the schematic
      figures, two types of paintings have been proposed: those related to spread-eagled
      figures and those representing zoomorphs (animal-like figures). The paintings
      were made until several decades ago, as testified by depictions of cars that
      can be found at some sites. In this case, the interpretation of the paintings
      is straightforward, as the images depicted can still be related to current rituals
      often employing masks in a variety of shapes.  The spread-eagled paintings may
      be associated with a Chewa girl’s initiation ceremony and would act as a mnemonic
      tool during the ritual, while the zoomorphic paintings may depict spirit characters
      of the Chewa men’s secret society, the *nyau*. In many cases, these paintings
      can overlap the older red paintings already existing at some sites'

    title_internal: 'Malawi: country, chapter 8'
    body: 'Although it is generally accepted that the red schematic paintings are
      older than the white ones, the exact chronology of these styles is still under
      discussion.  The earliest evidence for human occupation in the region according
      to the archaeological record is around 2,500 years ago, and it is generally
      assumed that Late Stone Age hunters and gatherers made this rock art. Unfortunately
      no datable evidence has been found although groups of these people survived
      until the 1800s in Malawi. For the white paintings, chronologies are more accurate:
      the Chewa people are thought to have arrived to central Malawi in the 15th century,
      and as aforementioned, painting traditions were still alive in the mid-20th
      century.  '

    body: 'Angola is a country located in the south-west of Africa, stretching from
      the Atlantic Ocean to the centre of the continent.  Angolan rock art consists
      both of  engravings and paintings, and is mostly located relatively near to
      the coast, although some sites have also been documented in the easternmost
      part of the country, near the border with Zambia.  Depictions are very varied,
      representing animals, human figures and geometric signs, in many cases grouped
      in hunting or war scenes.  In some cases, firearms appear represented, showing
      the period of contact with Europeans from the 1500s onwards.  '

    title: Geography and rock art distribution
    title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 2'
    body: Angola has a variety of climates.  The flat coastal plain ranges between
      25 and 150 km in width, and is a semiarid region covered by scrub, turning into
      sand dunes to the south, near Namibia.  The coastal region abruptly gives way
      to a series of mountains and escarpments divided  by the Cuanza River.  The
      northern part has an average height of 500 m, but the southern region is far
      higher, with the peaks occasionally exceeding 2,300 m.  This mountainous region
      is in fact a transitional area between the coastal plain and the great central
      plateau of Africa.  This plateau dominates Angola’s geography with an altitude
      from 1,200 to 1,800 m, and consists of a region of plains and low hills with
      a tropical climate.  The climate becomes drier to the south and wetter to the
      north, where a wide region of the country can be defined as rainforest.

      art sites have also been discovered in the interior of the country, especially
      in its east-central region, and therefore this concentration in the coast could
      be explained by different research priorities in the past. Although both paintings

    body: 'Although there are some references in Portuguese chronicles from the 1500s
      and 1600s  which could correspond to rock art paintings, the first clear mention
      of a rock art site was made in 1816 with research only starting in 1939, when
      José Redinha published the first news about engravings of Angola.  Since then,
      research was intermittent until the 1950s, when the important site of Tchitundu-Hulu
      was studied and published.  The relevance of Tchitundu-Hulu attracted the attention
      of important scholars such as Desmond Clark and the  Abbé Breuil, who along
      with Portuguese researchers contextualized Angolan rock art within the continent.  Research
      increased significantly over the next two decades, but during the 1980s political
      instability gave way to a period of stagnation until the 1990s, when new researchers
      began comprehensive surveys and organised the available rock art information.  '

    title: 'Themes '
    title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 5'
    body: 'The rock art in Angola has a wide variety of styles and themes, depending
      on the region and the chronology.  The oldest images are painted or engraved
      geometric symbols and anthropomorphic figures.  More recent depictions include
      axes, spears and firearms.  The latest period of the Angolan rock art includes
      complex scenes of war and hunting, and in a number of cases human figures carried
      on a palanquin-like structure.  Although schematic figures are widespread throughout
      the country, they are predominant in the south-west where most of the sites
      have been compared to those in the Central Africa Schematic Art zone, with parallels
      in Malawi and Mozambique.  In the west-central area of Angola, in addition to
      the schematic symbols and animals, images of men holding weapons, fighting and
      hunting are common, including warriors holding firearms which make reference
      to the first contact with Europeans by the 16th century.  Near the north-west
      coast, some of the paintings and engravings have been related to objects used
      in religious ceremonies –wooden statuettes or decorated pot lids.  In particular,
      a close association has been establish between rock art depictions and the so-called
      Cabinda pot lids, which have different carved symbols—animals, objects, human
      figures—acting as a shared visual language.  '

    title: " Chronology"
    title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 6'
    body: 'As is so often the case with rock art, the dating of images is complex
      due to the absence of direct correlations between rock art depictions and well
      contextualised archaeological remains.  Some of the sites with rock art have
      been excavated showing dates of the 7th millennium BC, but the relationship
      with the rock art is unclear.  In the Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume site, the excavation
      at the cave provided a 1st millennium BC date, and the only radiocarbon date
      taken from the pigments at this site provided a date of the 1st century AD,
      which corresponds with other dates of the same style in Central Africa.  The
      second tool for assigning a chronology is the analysis of the subject matter
      represented in the rock art depictions: the presence of metal objects, for example,
      would imply a date of the 1st millennium AD onwards, when this material was
      introduced.  Whereas, depictions featuring images of firearms would date from
      the 16th century onwards.  The end of the rock art tradition has been associated
      with the presence of Europeans but was probably progressive as the control of
      the region by the Portuguese grew during the 17th and 18th centuries.  '

    body: 'Botswana, a landlocked country in southern Africa, has a landscape defined
      by the Kalahari Desert in the west and the Okavango Delta in the north. Rock
      art can be found in the north, north-west and east of the country. One of the
      most well-known locations is the Tsodilo Hills in the north-west which contains
      evidence of human occupation that goes back 100,000 years. This area has yielded
      more than 4,000 paintings and has been termed the *Louvre of the Desert*. It
      also has engraved cupules and grooves dating back to the first millennium AD. '

    title: Geography and rock art distribution
    title_internal: 'Botswana: country, chapter 2'
    body: The Republic of Botswana is bordered by South Africa to the south, Namibia
      to the west and north and Zimbabwe to the north-east. It shares a short border
      consisting of a few hundred metres with Zambia to the north. The majority of
      this flat country, around 70%, is made up of the Kalahari Desert, with the Okavango
      Delta, one of the world’s largest inland deltas located in the north. Botswana
      has a subtropical climate of hot summers and warm winters due to its high altitude
      and is semi-arid due to the short rainy season. Rock art is scattered across
      the country with the main sites being found in the Tsodilo Hills in the north-
      west;  the Gubatshaa Hills in the Chobe National Park, east of the Okavango
      Delta;  Tuli Block in the far east of the country and Manyana in the south-east.

    title: Research history
    title_internal: 'Botswana: country, chapter 3'
    body: |
      German geologist Siegfried Passarge visited the Tsodilo Hills on the 1st July 1898, mapping the area, writing on the geology and photographing a few rock paintings. In 1907, he published tracings of his photos in Die Buschmänner der Kalahari. A passing mention of the Hills was made in 1913 in a brief report by Max Happe, but it was François Balsan, a French industrialist and explorer, who raised the profile of Tsodilo Hills when over two days he photographed and prepared tracings of what has come to be known as the “Rhino Panel” on September 27-28 1951.

      Laurens van der Post’s publication of *The Lost World of the Kalahari* in 1958 brought Tsodilo Hills and its rock art to the attention of the wider world. Van der Post, an Afrikaner, had planned to make a film of the rock art in the region, but a number of events including the shooting of a steenbok (a severe crime locally), the cameras jamming and swarms of bees descending upon their camp, conspired against him and resulted in van der Post leaving the Hills in despair. However, he also left an apologetic note at the rock art panel he had been trying to film as a way of assuaging the wrath of the “Spirit of the Hills” as he put it. The rock face he was trying to film, comprising eland, giraffe and handprints, is now known as “Van der Post Panel”.

      In 1963 Alec Campbell visited the region with George Silberbauer, an ethnographer who had studied the San|Bushmen in Botswana. As Director of Botswana’s National Museum, Campbell had a little government funding to record the rock art and excavate the rock shelters. Subsequently he collaborated with archaeologists Larry Robbins, Mike Murphy, and paleo-geographer George Brook.

      During the 1990s, Campbell, along with the staff from the National Museum recorded around 400 rock art sites numbering over 4,000 individual paintings. In 2001 Tsodilo Hills became a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its spiritual significance to local peoples, as well as its unique record of human settlement over many millennia.

    title: Distribution and themes
    title_internal: 'Botswana: country, chapter 5'
    body: |-
      Tuli Block is a narrow fringe of land in the far east of the country that borders South Africa and lies on the banks of the Limpopo River. This area is characterised by rock engravings of human and animal footprints, and cupules, which hold spiritual importance both for San|Bushman¹ hunter-gatherers and Tswana farmers. The engravings are thought to refer to a local myth that tells of an ancestor, named Matsieng, who is believed to have emerged from a waterhole followed by his animals. However, there are several localities in the region that claim this origin myth. It is thought the engravings in this area were created by the San|Bushmen and linked to their belief system, appropriated later by the Tswana farmers.

      The most renowned rock art in Botswana comes from the Tsodilo Hills in the north-west of the country. With more than 4,500 paintings preserved in an area of 10km² it has been termed the “Louvre of the Desert”.  Tsodilo is made up of four main hills; Male Hill, Female Hill, Child Hill and North Hill, and paintings occur on all four. The subject matter, comprised of red and white paintings, includes animals, human figures and geometric designs. Red paintings are likely to have been made by San|Bushmen, while the white paintings are more difficult to attribute authorship to but may be a later continuation of the red tradition. There are no engraved images at Tsodilo but cupules and ground grooves are a common feature.  Dating of the paintings at Tsodilo has been difficult, and because many of them occur on exposed surfaces where they are susceptible to damage by the sun, rain and wind, what remains is probably not very old. However, paintings of cattle, which are also badly faded, probably date to between AD 800 and 1150 when people kept these animals in this area.

      ¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

    body: 'Rock art is rare in the south-east of the country, but the site of Manyana
      is noteworthy because it is the only one that has been excavated. The paintings
      are found at five sites along a rock outcrop of 0.75 km at the base of the Koboleng
      Hills, and while once richly decorated, many of the paintings have now faded.
      It is difficult to determine exactly when the paintings were made, but excavation
      shows the use of ochre from the earliest occupation levels dating to the Late
      Stone Age, around AD 100 - 800, with the latest occupation levels dating to
      the Late Iron Age, around AD 1600-1700. Interestingly, none of the paintings
      were done in white, a colour found at many other sites in Botswana and other
      regions of southern Africa, and often attributed to paintings of Iron Age date.
      In addition, there are no images of eland or figures combining human/antelope
      form which are common occurrences in South African rock art. '

    body: Because the identity of the artists are unknown to us we can only speculate
      on the function and/or meanings of the art in relation to other rock art traditions
      in southern Africa.  These may include fertility, health, abundance, protection
      against evil spirits or summoning rain. Contemporary communities at Tsodilo
      Hills believe that spirits live in the Hills and have explained how those who
      enter the Hills must be respectful as the spirits are capable of both curing
      and punishing people. In particular, White Paintings Shelter in the Tsodilo
      Hills was used as a place to perform curative dances that involved the placing
      of hands on the paintings in order to use its power. Geometric designs are more
      difficult to interpret but may fit into a tradition of other geometric symbols
      in the region and represent weather and fertility symbols.

    title: Introduction - Geography and rock art distribution
    title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 1'
    body: 'Zimbabwe is a landlocked country surrounded by Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana
      and South Africa, occupying a large, granitic high plateau between the Zambezi
      and Limpopo river systems, with a tropical climate moderated by altitude. The
      highest part of the country is the eastern Highlands; a north-south mountain
      range reaching altitudes of 2,500 m. Rock art is located in two main areas,
      the northern region of Mashonaland and the south-western area of Matabeleland.
      These areas are full of granite hills and boulders that provide excellent shelters
      for the paintings. The Matobo hills in Matabeleland constitute one of the most
      outstanding examples of rock art in Southern Africa. The total number of Zimbabwean
      rock art sites is unknown, but estimations made point to thousands of sites
      throughout the country, with more being discovered annually. '

    title: History of the research
    title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 2'
    body: 'Zimbabwean rock art was first reported by Europeans in 1927, when Miles
      Burkitt visited southern Africa, but is especially linked to Leo Frobenius,
      one of the most renowned researchers in the first decades of the 20th century.
      Leo Frobenius travelled to the region in 1928 with a German team and thoroughly
      documented numerous paintings, identifying many of the most characteristic features
      of Zimbabwean rock art. However, he failed in identifying the authors of the
      paintings, ascribing them to external influences of “high civilizations” instead
      to the local communities who made them. Subsequently, work was continued by
      Elizabeth Mannsfeld-Goodall, who for forty years documented rock art paintings
      constituting a huge corpus of tracings, but without developing an interpretative
      framework for them. In the 1950s, another historic researcher, the Abbé Henri
      Breuil, visited Zimbabwe and studied the paintings, again suggesting an Egyptian
      or Minoan origin. It wasn’t until the 1960s and 1970s when a more objective
      approach to the study of rock art started, with Peter Garlake the most prominent
      figure in research from the 1980s onwards. Garlake wrote the first comprehensive
      books on Zimbabwean rock art (Garlake 1987), integrating it within the general
      framework of southern Africa and raising awareness about the importance of these
      archaeological expressions. In 2003 the Matobo Hills were included in the World
      Heritage List acknowledging the relevance of Zimbabwean rock art for African
      heritage. '

    title: Themes
    title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 3'
    body: The rock art of Zimbabwe is some of the richest in Africa both in variety
      and complexity, the vast majority being painted figures infilled or outlined
      usually with just one colour, although bichrome examples are also known. The
      human figure is the most often represented engaged in different activities -hunting,
      walking, dancing- either isolated or in groups of up to forty people. The figures
      are depicted in different styles, from the very schematic to relatively naturalistic
      outlines, with men far more represented than women, and usually depicted carrying
      bows and arrows. In some cases, these figures are part of very complex scenes
      including animals and geometric symbols, some of which have been interpreted
      as trance-like scenes similar to those in South Africa with figures bleeding
      from their noses, crouching or dancing in groups or sharing animal traits. A
      very specific type of depiction is human figures with hugely distended abdomens,
      a trait that is associated either with fertility or mystic potency concepts.

    body: 'Along with human figures, animals are widely represented in Zimbabwean
      rock art, with kudu depictions dominating, but also with zebra, tsessebe and
      sable antelopes commonly represented. Surprisingly, other antelopes such as
      eland, waterbucks or wildebeest are very rarely represented, while other animals
      (lions, cheetah, birds, ant bears, porcupines, baboons or warthogs) are very
      scarce. Fish and crocodiles are relatively common, the latter represented as
      if seen from above or below. There seems to be a preference for the depiction
      of females rather than males, especially in the case of antelopes or elephants.
      Regardless of the type of animal, the depictions seem to have a deep symbolism
      far beyond the representation of animals just hunted and consumed, often being
      surrounded by dots, flecks or networks of lines. That symbolism is especially
      important in the case of the elephant, which is often depicted being hunted
      by groups of men. '

    body: |-
      Traditionally, the themes expressed in Zimbabwean rock art have been identified as the same as those of the San|Bushmen¹ from South Africa and in many cases are undoubtedly related, and provide key hints for their interpretation. However, there are also differences, such as the emphasis given to different animals, the higher presence of trees and plants in Zimbabwe or the smaller presence of trance scenes in the north compared to that of the Drakensberg. Moreover, the lack of ethnographic information for Zimbabwean paintings and their older chronology make it difficult to establish the same type of associations as those made for other areas with more direct connections rock art to known cultures, as happens in South Africa. Although in a minority, rock art of a later chronology can be attributed to Iron Age farmers, characterized by more schematic figures, usually white and painted thickly with the finger or the hand. As is the case in other areas in Central Africa, some of these later depictions are related to rain making and initiation ceremonies.

      ¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

    title: Chronology
    title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 6'
    body: "As with much rock art, the dating of Zimbabwe paintings is a challenging
      subject, although there is a consensus about them being significantly older
      than those of the Drakensberg and probably dated at before 2,000 years ago.
      The lack of any type of agriculture-related images in the paintings, which was
      established by the 1st millennium AD, sets a relative dating for the depictions,
      while the scarcity of sheep (introduced by the second half of the first millennium
      BC in the area) points to a time period in which these animals were still uncommon.
      These hints and the fact that, unlike in other areas there are not historical
      subjects represented in the paintings, seems to indicate that Zimbabwean paintings
      are at least 1,000 years old. However, archaeological evidence (Walker 2012:
      44) suggests that rock art could be significantly older than that, at least
      several thousands of years old. \n\n"

    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 1'
    body: |
      The rock art of South Africa has probably been studied more extensively than that of any other African country.  It is estimated that South Africa contains many thousands of rock art sites, with a great variety of styles and techniques.  The most well-known rock art in South Africa is that created by the San|Bushman¹ people (several culturally linked groups of indigenous people of southern Africa who were traditionally hunter-gatherers) and their ancestors, with the painted rock shelters of the Drakensberg mountains some of the most well-known rock art sites in the world.  However, the range of South African rock art is wide, spanning great distances, many centuries, and different cultural traditions.

      ¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

    title: Geography and rock art distribution
    title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 2'
    body: South Africa covers around 1,213,090 km², encircling Lesotho and bordered
      in the north by Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe and in the west by Mozambique
      and Swaziland.  Much of the interior of the country consists of a high central
      plateau bordered by the Great Escarpment, a rocky ridge which forms the bulk
      of the long Drakensberg mountain system in the east and several smaller ranges
      in the centre and west of the country, as well as the western border with Lesotho.  Further
      to the south, the Cape Fold Mountains mirror the bend of the cape coast.  Much
      of South Africa’s known engraved rock art is found on igneous or metamorphic
      formations in the semi-arid environments of the central plateau.  In contrast,
      painted rock art sites are more commonly located in the sandstone and quartzite
      rock shelters of the mountain systems, which form the edges of the more temperate,
      low-lying coastal regions in the east and south of the country.

    title: Hunter-gatherer rock art
    title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 3'
    body: Much of both the painted and engraved rock art of South Africa is characterised
      by its naturalistic depictions of animals, as well as numerous images of people,
      ambiguous figures with mixtures of animal and human features, and certain ‘geometric’
      or abstract shapes and patterns.  These images are the work of San|Bushman people
      and their ancestors.  Although San|Bushman communities now live mainly in Namibia,
      Botswana and north-western South Africa, historically San|Bushman cultural groups
      lived more widely throughout southern Africa.  Hunter-gatherer people are thought
      to have been the only inhabitants of what is now South Africa until the arrival
      of herding and farming people from the north from around 2,000 years ago.

    title: Farmer rock art
    title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 4'
    body: "Some paintings and engravings in South Africa were made by Bantu language-speaking
      farming people.  These include a distinct tradition of rock shelter paintings
      found in the north-west of the country, featuring mostly white finger-painted
      images of animals such as crocodiles and giraffes and other motifs.  These paintings,
      located in remote areas, are known to have been created by Northern Sotho people.
      Further to the south and west, engraved designs showing conjoined circle motifs
      are found throughout KwaZulu Natal and some areas of Mpumalanga and Gauteng
      Provinces, and appear to have been made by the ancestors of Sotho-Tswana and
      Nguni language speakers, perhaps ancestors of modern Zulu people.\n\n"

    title: Herder rock art and other traditions
    title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 5'
    body: Some rock art styles and motifs elsewhere in South Africa seem to belong
      to other unique traditions.  It has been proposed that engraved rock art patterns
      with particular features including circular, linear and oblong motifs found
      at sites across the country, particularly near watercourses, may be the work
      of the Khoekhoen people or their ancestors, herders culturally related to the
      San|Bushmen. Some paintings also appear to reflect this tradition. Local rock
      art traditions specific to certain areas include, among others, conglomerations
      of handprints near the coast in the south-western part of the Western Cape and
      rows of engraved cupules in the north east of the country. There are also several
      examples from different rock art traditions across South Africa, of depictions
      of European people, items or events (such as horses and firearms) which clearly
      date from the 17th century or later.  In the Karoo region, rock gongs (natural
      rock formations with indentations indicating that they have been used as percussive
      instruments) are sometimes associated with engraving sites.

      known to local communities, even where the art''s creators were not from within
      them. The presence of rock art in the Cape region has been known to Europeans
      since at least the mid- 18th century AD, with one of the first known reports
      from the expedition of  Ensign A. F. Beutler in 1752, describing paintings near
      the Great Fish River in the Eastern Cape.  Further written references to rock
      art from the area were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, with some
      of the earliest known reproductions of Southern African rock art made in the
      1770s. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, painted copies were made of
      San|Bushman rock art by amateur artists such as George Stow, Mark and Graham
      Hutchinson and Helen Tongue. '

      analysing paintings from 150 Drakensberg sites and attempting to gain insight
      into their execution and significance through a combination of quantitative
      study and reference to San|Bushman ethnography (written records of insights
      from San|Bushman culture compiled by anthropologists).  Through the 1980s, interpretation
      of rock art was further developed, perhaps most significantly by David Lewis-Williams,
      a collaborator of Vinnicombe's. Lewis-Williams originated an approach to understanding
      San|Bushman rock art which posits that the motivation and meaning for most,
      if not all, San|Bushman rock art is based on the centrality of the spiritual
      leader or'shaman' and the shaman’s actions in San|Bushman life and belief.  Over
      the past 30 years, the idea that much of San|Bushman rock art is essentially
      ‘shamanistic’ in nature has been dominant in academic discourse.

    title: Themes and interpretations
    title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 9'
    body: "Shamanistic interpretations of San|Bushman paintings and engravings draw
      on both past records of ‘Southern’ or /Xam San|Bushman people living historically
      in South Africa and more recent ethnography based mainly on San|Bushman communities
      in Namibia and Botswana, suggesting that their imagery illustrated and reinforced
      the power of the actions of shamans. Much of the imagery is proposed to reflect
      the shaman’s hallucinatory visions from the 'trance dance’, a tradition common
      to San|Bushman groups where shamans enter a trance state during which they visit
      a 'spirit world' in which they may go on spiritual journeys or perform tasks
      on behalf of their communities. It is thought that the rock art panels may have
      acted as reservoirs for the 'potency' that shamans are considered to possess,
      with the rock face considered a veil between both worlds.  The images are thought
      to reflect trance experiences including those of 'therianthropes’, images of
      figures with both human and animal features, explained as shamans who in a trance
      state feel themselves transformed into animals.  Certain other poses and features
      found in San|Bushman rock art, such as so-called 'entoptic' motifs—geometric
      shapes such as zigzags and dots—have also been interpreted as reflecting visions
      that shamans experience while in a trance state.  \n\nDiscussion continues around
      the extent of the applicability of 'shamanist' interpretations for all aspects
      of San|Bushman art, with research ongoing and scholars also exploring the potential
      roles of other elements in rock art production, such as mythology or gender
      and initiation rites.  Other avenues of study include more regional foci, on
      specific cultural and temporal contexts and how the imagery may reflect local
      power dynamics through time.\n"

      ceremonies, while Bantu-language speakers''engravings of interlinked circle

      geometric forms of rock engraving may be of Khoekhoen origin, possibly showing
      influence from central African geometric traditions and tracing historical migrations
      southwards.  It has also been suggested that some finger-painted images in the
      centre of the country are the early 19th century work of the Korana people,
      a group of mixed ancestry living as raiders on the Cape frontier and incorporating
      motifs from San|Bushman and other traditions. '

      art in South Africa comes from Steenbokfontein Cave in the Western Cape, where
      collapsed painted portions from the wall buried in sediment have been radiocarbon
      dated to at least 3,600 years ago, while in the Drakensberg, AMS dating carried
      out on the oxalate crust superimposing a painting of a human figure has suggested
      it to be at least 1,800 years old.  While it is thought that the beginnings
      of the painting tradition in the Drakensberg region are probably older than
      this, the relative lack of durability in paint means that many of the existing
      paintings were probably made sometime within the past few hundred years. Sometimes
      it is apparent when this is the case - several painting sites in this region
      show images of both San|Bushman people and Europeans riding horses and bearing
      firearms, which dates them to within the past 350 years and particularly the
      19th century.  Images of sheep and cattle also place images within the last
      2,000 years.  \n\nThe oldest reliably dated evidence for deliberate engraving
      in the country is several ochre pieces incised with abstract patterns found
      in a buried layer in Blombos cave in the Western Cape and dated through a number
      of methods to between 70 and 100,000 years ago.  The earliest known figurative
      engraving date from the country comes from a slab with an image of a portion
      of an animal on it, excavated from Wonderwerk Cave in the Northern Cape and
      dating from around 10,200 years ago.  Engravings remaining in the open are more
      difficult to date scientifically, and various attempts have been made to date
      and sequence both engravings and paintings based on style and superimposition,
      while recent years, work has been undertaken to apply the Harris Matrix (an
      archaeological sequencing technique for relative dating) method to painting
      chronologies in the Free State, Drakensberg and Western Cape.  This involves
      using techniques originally conceived for charting chronology in stratigraphic
      layering to compare and sequence different superimposed motifs.\n"

    body: "Rock art is found across the country from the southern border almost to
      the northern border, although rock art sites are scarce in the far north.  The
      majority of known rock art sites are found in the rocky and mountainous areas
      forming the escarpment edge in the west of the country.  Particular concentrations
      of rock art are found in the west-centre of the country, north of the edge of
      the Namib’s coastal sand sea.  Namibia’s most well-known rock art locales are
      clustered in this area, among them the Brandberg (also known as Dâures) and
      Erongo mountains and the Spitzkoppe peaks, as well as the well-known engraved
      rock art complex at  Twyfelfontein | /Ui-//aes.  \n\nAround  20km wide, the
      almost circular granitic intrusion of the Brandberg contains Namibia’s highest
      point  at over 2,500 ft., and around 1,000 rock art sites, with around 50,000
      individual figures recorded. These include both paintings and engravings but
      paintings form the majority. The Erongo mountains, a similar but less compact
      formation around 120km to the south-east, contain a further 80 sites and 50km
      to the west of this, the Spitzkoppe peaks, a group of granite inselbergs, has
      a smaller concentration of known sites with 37 so far recorded.  Painting sites
      are most often found on vertical surfaces in rock shelters or the sides of granitic
      boulders,  while engravings may survive in more exposed environments such as
      on boulders, often dolerite or sandstone.   \n\nThe most well-known of the engraving
      sites is that of Twyfelfontein | /Ui-//aes, around 50 km north of the Brandberg.
      The rock art complex here is dominated by collections of engraved images, though
      some paintings are also present.  With well over 2,000 individual images, the
      Twyfelfontein engravings form the largest known discrete collection of engraved
      rock art in Southern Africa.   \n"

      that of C. J. Andersson who mentioned “A strange tale of a rock in which the
      tracks of …animals are distinctly visible” in his 1856 book Lake Ngami.  Further
      reports came in the 1870s when the Reverend C. J. Büttner published an article
      in a South African periodical reporting rock art in the Erongo Mountains, while
      Commissioner William Coates Palgrave made a report of paintings near Dassiesfontein,
      along with some the earliest known photographs of rock art in Africa.  European
      public awareness of rock art from the region in Europe was spurred by the January
      1910 publication of an article  by Oberleutnant Hugo Jochmann featuring images
      from various sites in a German magazine.  The  first monograph on the rock art
      of the area then known as South West Africa was published in 1930 (Obermaier
      & Kühn, 1930), following further reports by officials, including the explorer
      and geographer Reinhardt Maack, who in a 1921 report first noted the existence

    body: "During the course of an earlier expedition, Maack had stumbled upon a singular
      painting in a Brandberg rock shelter. This image came to be well-known as the
      ‘White Lady’ of the Brandberg, after the renowned rock art researcher the Abbé
      Henri Breuil, who saw Maack’s copy of it and took a keen interest in the image.
      Eventually Breuil published a lavishly illustrated volume on the White Lady
      in 1955, which made it one of the most famous rock painting images in the world.
      \ During the 1940s and 50s Breuil also explored and published on rock art sites
      elsewhere in the Brandberg and Erongo mountains.  \n\nErnst Scherz, who had
      acted as a guide for Breuil, would go on to conduct extensive documentation
      work throughout the country as part of  the comprehensive research project investigating
      the archaeology of South West Africa run by the University of Cologne and sponsored
      by the Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft.  Beginning in 1963, this resulted in
      the publications of Scherz’s three-volume opus *Felsbilder in Sudwest-Afrika*
      in 1970, 1975 and 1986, containing site by site descriptions and classifications
      of painting and engraving sites throughout modern Namibia, along with discussion
      of theme and context.  The Cologne programme also supported the work of several
      other researchers, including the designer and artist Harald Pager, whose meticulous
      work recording rock paintings in South Africa’s Drakensberg had already gained
      him recognition in the field of rock art research. From 1977, Pager began a
      seven year project of recording painted rock art sites in the Brandberg, documenting
      around 43,000 individual images.  Pager’s corpus has been organised by Tilman
      Lenssen-Erz and published posthumously in the six-volume   *Rock Paintings of
      the Upper Brandberg*, as a result of which the Brandberg is one of the most
      comprehensively documented rock art regions on earth.\n"

    body: "Much of the painted rock art in Namibia may be broadly compared to the
      wider hunter-gatherer rock art oeuvre found throughout southern Africa, similar
      in theme and composition and believed to be a part of the same general tradition,
      which is generally attributed to San|Bushman¹ people and their ancestors.  Imagery
      includes scenes of human figures carrying bows and other implements, wild animals
      and unidentified shapes in different pigments.  Overall, human figures dominate
      in the paintings of Namibia, making up more than 2/3 of the painted figures,
      and where the gender can be recognised, they are more commonly male than female.
      \ Prominent painting subjects and styles in the rock art of Namibia (particularly
      the best-studied west-central region) include, at some sites, clearly delineated
      dots and patterns on human figures, a particular tradition of showing human
      figures with voluminous decorated hairstyles, and more images of giraffe and
      kudu, gemsbok and springbok antelope than in other southern African regions.
      \ Other images of animals include those of zebras, elephants, rhinoceros and
      ostriches.  More occasional motifs found include plants, cattle, sheep and handprints.
      \n\n¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher
      groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.
      Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these

    body: "Within Namibia, paintings come in a variety of styles, ranging from naturalistic
      to stylised.  Paintings found at Spitzkoppe tend to be smaller and cruder than
      others in the region, where some sites feature tableaux in many colours while
      others are entirely monochrome.   While the majority of rock  paintings in Namibia
      seem to conform to the hunter-gatherer style, there are also some examples of
      finger paintings in the Brandberg and northern Namibia, which are much more
      schematic in style and appear to belong to a different tradition altogether.
      \ \n\nAs with much southern African rock art, the colours visible today may
      not always accurately reflect the original look as some pigments.  This is particularly
      true for those used for pale colours or white, which may be ‘fugitive’, meaning
      that over time they fade or wash away faster than the more stable pigments around
      them, leaving gaps which were once coloured.  Chemical analyses have shown that
      a major binder (used to coalesce dry pigment powder) for painted rock art in
      Namibia was blood, and in some cases egg white.   \n"

      more common than those in paintings, there is a comparative dearth of engraved
      human figures.  There is also less obvious interaction between individual engraved

      individuals scattered on rock surfaces. Engraved rock art in Namibia also features
      a particular preponderance of  images of spoor (animal hoof or paw prints).  Some
      of these engravings are very naturalistic and may be identified by species whereas
      others, such as some showing human footprints, can be quite schematic.  In addition,
      many engravings are geometric in nature.   '

    title: Interpretation
    title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 11'
    body: "Namibian rock paintings, and most engravings, have largely been interpreted
      in the vein largely espoused by  researchers over the past 30 years.  This postulates
      that much of this rock art reflects the experience of San|Bushman shamans entering
      trance states and that rather than being scenes from daily life, the depictions
      of animals and activities are highly symbolic within San|Bushman cosmology,
      with images acting as reservoirs of spiritual power.  This avenue of interpretation
      originates largely from the study of rock art in South Africa and Lesotho.  While
      it appears broadly applicable here, the fact that direct attributions to known
      cultural groups in this area are difficult somewhat hinders direct comparisons
      with Namibian rock art.  While hunter-gatherer rock painting production in South
      Africa was practiced until the recent past, it appears to have ceased in Namibia
      around a thousand  years ago and modern San|Bushman groups in the Kalahari area
      have no tradition of rock art production.   \n\nAdditionally, hundreds of miles
      and different geographical environments separate the rock art centres of north-western
      Namibia from those in neighbouring countries. This is particularly apparent
      in the differences in terms of animal subject matter, with the numerous depictions
      of gemsbok and springbok, explicable by the rock art creators being semi-desert
      dwellers where gemsbok and springbok are found locally though largely absent
      from rock art elsewhere in southern Africa, where these animals are not found.

    body: "Other differences are found in style and emphasis: the frequency with which
      giraffe feature in Namibian paintings and engravings contrasts with the South
      African rock art, where the emphasis is more on the eland antelope.  This has
      led some to propose that the giraffe, similarly, must have held a particular
      symbolic meaning for the painters of the region.  Based on associated imagery,
      placement of the rock art sites, and some ethnography (written records of insights
      from contemporary San|Bushman culture compiled by anthropologists) it has been
      suggested that giraffes may have been linked with rain in local belief systems,
      with some Namibian rock painting sites are associated specifically with rainmaking
      or healing activities. \n\nWhile the more naturalistic examples of engravings
      are thought to have also been produced by ancient hunter-gatherers, as with
      the paintings, it has been suggested that some geometric engravings were produced
      \ by herding people, possibly ancestral Khoenkhoen, perhaps in relation to initiation
      rites.  Schematic finger paintings have also been attributed to pastoralist
      people.  All attributions are tentative, however, because the majority of the
      art is thought to be many hundreds of years old and the historical distinctions
      between hunter-gatherers and herders is by no means clear-cut in the archaeological

    title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 13'
    body: "The pieces from the cave Wendt excavated (named ‘Apollo 11 Cave’ after
      the moon mission which took place during the period of the excavation work)
      are not thought to have fallen from a cave wall but were made on loose rock
      pieces.  The only parietal art (on a fixed rock surface) dated from excavated
      deposits in Namiba so far consists of pieces of painted granite from the largest
      painted shelter in the Brandberg, one of which, found in a sedimentary layer
      radiocarbon dated to around 2,700 years ago, had clearly fallen from an exposed
      rock surface into which researchers were able to refit it. Aside from this,
      estimates at the age of rock art are based on superimposition, patination and
      associated archaeological finds. \n\nBased on archaeological evidence, it is
      thought that the majority of the fine-line hunter-gatherer rock art in the Brandberg
      area was produced between around 4,000 and 2,000 years ago, with the painting
      tradition in the wider region starting as much as 6,000 years ago. This ceased
      sometime after the introduction of small domestic stock to the area, although
      not immediately, as fine-line paintings of sheep and paintings and engravings
      of cattle testify.   Across central Namibia, there appears to be a particularly
      strong correspondence of finds relating to paintings—such as grinding equipment
      and pigments—with dated layers from the 1st millennium BC.\n"

      certain images, such as those of zebras, are thought to be relatively late.  Among
      engravings of central Namibia, a certain style of hoof print appears to overlie

      body: The site of Shepe (also known as Chabbé, Šappe or Mancheti) is located
        in the Sidamo Zone of Oromia, about 250 km to the south of Addis Ababa. The
        region is a fertile, forest-mountainous area traditionally dedicated to the
        cultivation of coffee. The site is in a narrow gorge carved by the Shepe River
        at 1300 m above sea level, full of vegetation and therefore difficult to detect.
        Along this gorge there are several notable  engravings depicted in four panels,
        forming one of the most impressive – if secluded —  rock art sites in the
        Horn of Africa. The site was discovered in 1965 by Fitaorari Selechi Defabatchaw,
        governor of the Dilla district where the site is located, and was published
        by Francis Anfray two years later. Since that, the importance of Shepe has
        been widely recognized and some other sites with similar engravings have been
        documented in the surrounding area. This group (known generically as the Shepe-Galma
        group) constitutes one of the main areas of Ethiopian rock art, the other
        being the Laga Oda-Sourré group in the Harar region.

      body: 'The rock art of Shepe consists almost exclusively of engravings of humpless
        cows which follow very strict conventions: profile bodies, small heads with
        long horns seen from above, U-like bellies and udders very clearly depicted.
        Some of the cows have an unidentified, triangular object hanging from their
        left horn. In total, around 50 relatively large cows (40 to 70 cm in length)
        are depicted throughout the gorge walls, distributed in rows and groups to
        represent herds. The most original feature of these engravings is, however,
        the technique used to depict them: rather than carving the outline of the
        cows, the area around them has been lowered to provide a bas-relief effect
        which has no known parallels in the region. The surface of the cows has been
        polished to obtain a smooth appearance.'

      body: The chronology of the Shepe cows is difficult to determine, but stylistically
        they have been related to the Laga Oda paintings in the area of Harar and
        to other sites in Eritrea and Djibouti. According to most researchers, the
        Shepe figures have been ascribed to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabian style,
        with a generic chronology from the 3rd to the 1st millennia BC. Shepe engravings
        can be considered relatively naturalistic, and therefore should be among the
        oldest depictions of this style. Other interpretations, however, consider
        Shepe and the nearby sites a completely differentiated school whose chronology
        is still unclear but could be more recent.

      title_internal: 'Ethiopia: featured site, chapter 4'
      body: Regarding their meaning, only conjecture can be made at present, but it
        seems quite likely that they were made by pastoral communities to whom cattle
        were fundamental. The careful depiction of the udders, the repetition of this
        single motif and the effort paid to achieve the bas-relief effect imply a
        paramount importance of cattle in the economy and society of the group that
        engraved them. The fact that some of the cows have what seem to be adornments
        hanging from the horns (a feature documented in other rock art regions as
        the Libyan Messak) also points in that direction. Contemporary groups, such
        as the Nuer in nearby Sudan have similar traditions of horn adornments, and
        throughout the Omo river region different techniques of embellishment (ear
        cutting, horn shaping, modifications of the hump) have been documented, and
        in all of them cattle are a key cultural mark as well as an economic resource.  Of
        course, direct links cannot be established between these contemporary examples
        and the communities that made the engravings of Shepe, but the cattle depictions
        in the ravine are nevertheless a document of the importance and consideration
        given to cattle, an animal which was undoubtedly part of these groups’ identity.

      title: Introduction
      title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 1'
      body: Ethiopia is the biggest country of the Horn of Africa, a very diverse
        country which has traditionally been a melting pot of cultures, religions
        and ethnicities, acting as a crossroads between the Nile valley region, the
        Red Sea and East Africa. Most rock art is located in the southern part of
        the country, although smaller concentrations have been documented near the
        borders with Eritrea, Sudan and Kenya. Ethiopian rock art shows strong similarities
        with other countries in the Horn of Africa as well as Sudan and mostly consists
        of cow depictions dated from the 3rd millennium onwards, although other animals,
        anthropomorphic figures and geometric symbols are also fairly common.

      title: Geography and rock art distribution
      title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 2'
      body: The geography of Ethiopia is varied and ranges from high plateaus to savannahs
        and deserts.   The eastern part mostly consists of a range of plateaus and
        high mountains, which in some cases reach more than 4000m above sea level.
        To the north of these mountains is Lake Tana, the biggest lake in Ethiopia
        and the source of the Blue Nile, one of the two tributaries of the Nile. The
        mountains are divided in two by the Great Rift Valley, which runs north-east
        to south-west, - and is one of the most important areas for the study of human
        evolution. The highlands are surrounded by tropical savannah and grassland
        regions to the west and south-west, while to the east lays the Danakil desert,
        one of the most inhospitable regions on earth. The south-eastern corner of
        Ethiopia, which borders Somalia, is a semi-desert plateau ranging from 300-1500
        m above sea level.

      body: 'Ethiopian rock art is located around two main areas: around the city
        of Harar to the east and the Sidamo region to the south-west. The first group
        comprises mainly painted depictions, while the second one is characterized
        by a bas-relief technique specific only to this area. However, rock art has
        also been discovered in other areas, such as the border with Eritrea, the
        area near Kenya and the Benishangul-Gumuz region, a lowland area along the
        border with Sudan. As research increases, it is likely that more rock art
        sites will be discovered throughout the country. In addition to these engravings
        and paintings, Ethiopia is also known for its decorated stelae, tall stone
        obelisks that are usually engraved with culturally and religiously important
        symbols. One of these places is Tiya, a burial place declared a World Heritage
        Site which has 32 richly decorated stelae. Although not strictly rock art
        in the traditional sense, they nevertheless represent one of the most interesting
        group of archaeological remains in the south of Ethiopia and demonstrate similar
        techniques to some of the engraved depictions.'

      title: Research history
      title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 4'
      body: Ethiopian rock art has played a key role in the Horn of Africa research,
        and the studies undertaken in this country have structured the chronologies,
        styles and interpretations of the whole region. Research started as early
        as the mid-1930s when the Abbé Henri Breuil proposed a classification of Ethiopian
        rock art through the study of the Porc-Epic and Genda-Biftou sites. This proposal
        stated a progressive evolution in eight steps from naturalism to schematism,
        and set the interpretative framework for succeeding decades. Breuil’s ideas
        were generally followed by John Desmond Clark in his synthesis of the rock
        art in the Horn of Africa in 1954, and they also appear in the work of Paolo
        Graziosi (1964). During the 1960s, research was carried out by Francis Anfray
        in the Sidamo area and by Gerard Bailloud near Harar, where a report made
        for the Ethiopian government informed about the existence of around ten rock
        art sites in the same area.

      body: Rock art research in Ethiopia has traditionally included the term Ethiopian-Arabian
        style, coined in 1971 by Červiček to show the similarities between the depictions
        found in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The existence of this
        style is currently the paradigm used in most rock art interpretations of the
        region, although some concerns have been raised due to its too generic characteristics,
        which can be found in many other parts of Africa.  The 1990s and 2000s have
        seen a remarkable increase of rock art research in the country, with the renewal
        of studies in the main areas and the beginning of research in the regions
        of Tigray and Benishangul-Gumuz.

      body: Cattle and cattle-related depictions are the main subject of Ethiopian
        rock art, regardless of their relative chronology. The oldest depictions (based
        on Červiček’s works) are of humpless cows, while in the late stages of rock
        art humped cows and camels appear. Goats, sheep and dogs are very occasionally
        depicted, and unlike the Saharan rock art, wild animals such as giraffes and
        antelopes are scarce. Figures of cattle appear alone or in herds, and the
        depictions of cows with calves are a fairly common motif not only in Ethiopia
        but in the whole Horn of Africa.

      body: The other main group of depictions is of anthropomorphs, which are usually
        schematic and often distributed in rows. In some cases, the tendency to schematism
        is so pronounced that human figures are reduced to an H-like shape. Sometimes,
        human figures are represented as warriors, carrying weapons and on occasion
        fighting against other humans or big felines. Along with these figurative
        themes, geometric signs are very common in Ethiopian rock art, including groups
        of dots and other motifs that have been interpreted as symbols associated
        with groups that historically lived in the region.

        in the Harar region are mainly paintings, in Sidamo many figures are engraved
        in a very singular way, lowering the area around the figures to achieve a
        bas-relief effect. The clear differences between the Sidamo engravings (known

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 9'
      body: As is the case with most African rock art, absolute dates for depictions
        based on radiocarbon techniques are scarce, and therefore most of the chronological
        framework of Ethiopian rock art has to rely on the analysis of figures, superimpositions,
        parallels with depictions of better known areas and other indirect dating
        methods. In Ethiopian rock art it is generally assumed that the oldest depictions
        could be dated to the mid-third millennium BC, according to parallels with
        other Saharan rock art. As aforementioned, the so-called Ethiopian-Arabian
        style shows an evolution from naturalism to schematism, with an older group
        (Sourré-Hanakiya) showing strong similarities with rock art in Egypt, Sudan
        and Libya. A second, progressively schematic group (Dahtami) would last until
        the end of the first millennium BC. This date is supported by the appearance
        of camels and humped cows (zebus), which were introduced in the region at
        the end of the second half of the 1st millennium BC. The last stages of Ethiopian
        rock art relating to camel, warriors and geometric depictions can be considered
        to belong to the historical period, in some cases reaching very near to the
        present day.

      body: 'Lake Victoria is the largest lake in Africa, and at 69,484km², the second
        largest in the world by surface area.   Sitting in a depression in the plateau
        between the eastern and western valley branches of the geological East African
        Rift System, its shores are in Uganda, Tanzania, and to the south-east, in
        Kenya.   Mfangano Island, rising 300m out of the lake near the Kenyan shore,
        is home to some of the most prominent rock painting sites in the country,
        featuring abstract patterned paintings thought to have been created between
        1,000 and 4,000 years ago by  hunter-gatherers.   The rock paintings on Mfangano
        Island are found at two principal sites:  in a cave near the sea known as
        Mawanga, and at a rock shelter further inland called Kwitone.'

      body: Mawanga is a roughly triangular limestone cavern, about 18m wide across
        the mouth and 12m deep.  The roof slopes sharply to the back towards a raised
        platform against the rear of the left wall, on which 12 images of concentric
        circles and spirals in white and red have been painted. Kwitone has similar
        paintings, situated at one end of a long overhang in a sandstone cliff, below
        the shoulder of a ridge.  The rock art at Kwitone is at the far end on the
        shelter wall, several metres above a cleared floor section. The paintings
        here feature 11 distinct shapes including concentric circles and oblongs.
        One of these is a prominent sunburst pattern in brown, with rays emanating
        from the outermost band. The images are larger than those at Mawanga, averaging
        around 40cm in diameter, and less faded, exhibiting more brown pigment, although
        both sites appear to reflect the same artistic tradition. These are finger
        paintings, with pigment probably made of haematite or white clay mixed with
        a natural binder such as egg white or urine. There is evidence that the surface
        may also have also been prepared prior to painting, by polishing, and that
        some of the images may have reapplied or retouched over time.

      body: The circular shapes seen here are typical of an apparent wider East and
        Central African rock art tradition featuring a preponderance of circular motifs,
        usually attributed to people known as the Batwa, a Bantu-origin name for  a
        series of culturally related groups historically living around Africa’s Great
        Lakes region and more widely throughout Central Africa.  Like the San people,
        who are known to have been the creators of most of the famous rock art of
        Southern Africa, Batwa were traditionally hunter-gatherers, and are considered
        the most ancient indigenous populations of the area. In the early 20th century,
        it was proposed that East African rock art of this tradition could have been
        the work of ancestral San people, but it is now generally assumed to be of
        Batwa origin with, for example, possible parallels to be seen in the symbolic
        iconography with contemporary barkcloth designs of the related Mbuti people
        from the Democratic Republic of Congo (Namono, 2010).

      body: 'Further examples of apparently Batwa origin rock art can be seen in neighbouring
        Uganda and Tanzania, a reminder that contemporary political borders do not
        reflect physical partitions in the spatial coverage of rock art traditions.  Lolui
        Island, about 50km north west of Mfangano Island and  in Ugandan waters, is
        another important Lake Victoria rock art environment, featuring both painting
        sites and rock gongs (sonorous natural percussive instruments with the wear
        of use) which seem to be associated with the painting sites. There are also
        numerous sets of cupules—ground circular depressions in the rocks.  Some of
        these are referred to locally as Omweso, due to their bearing some resemblance
        to  the depressions used for holding gaming pieces in the so-named local variant
        of the Mancala-type board games played widely throughout eastern Africa.  However,
        their original significance and use is unknown.   Cupule sites are also found
        on the Kenyan mainland and on Mfangano island.  Many of these are clearly
        anthropogenic, however an unusual phenomenon is to be noted in the spectacular
        array of naturally formed cupule-like depressions in the limestone of Mawanga
        cave. This may remind us to exercise caution in ascribing ‘rock art’ status
        to all apparently patterned rock formations. The cause of these multitudinous
        small depressions is so far unknown. '

      body: 'The rock art sites of the eastern Lake Victoria region retain spiritual
        connotations for the communities living around them, even if their denoted
        modern significance differs from that envisioned by the original artists.
        The modern inhabitants of Mfangano Island are the Abasuba people, a Bantu
        language-speaking group unrelated to the Batwa who have nevertheless appropriated
        the sites as arenas of spiritual importance.  Members of the Wasamo clan in
        the area around Mawanga remember their having used the site for rain making
        rituals until a few decades ago, with red and white pigment apparently representing
        the moon and sun respectively.  Soot on the cave roof may indicate other recent
        human activity there. When the archaeologist James Chaplin—who first investigated
        the Kwitone site in the 1960s—visited it later, he was told by local Wagimbe
        clan people that they also held the paintings there to be associated with
        some taboos, and connected it with ancestor worship. These beliefs reflect
        events of the recent past, as the Abasuba only moved into the area in the
        last 400 years.  This followed an earlier occupation by Luo peoples, prior
        to which habitation by the Batwa is assumed. The local importance of the sites
        is highlighted in their stewardship by the Abasuba Peace Museum, which fosters
        a continuing relationship with the sites and those who live around them. '

      title: Introduction
      title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 1'
      body: Rock art is distributed widely throughout Kenya, although historically
        rock art research has not been as extensive as in neighbouring countries such
        as Tanzania. Some of Kenya's various rock art traditions are attributed to
        or associated with the ancestors of modern regional cultural groups, and as
        such sites sometimes retain local religious importance. Both painted and engraved
        imagery tends towards the symbolic and geometric, with occasional depictions
        of schematic animals and people. It must be noted that there are still probably
        many Kenyan rock art sites which have not yet become known outside of their
        local communities, if they are known at all.

      title: Geography and rock art distribution
      title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 2'
      body: Kenya covers about 569,140km², bordering Ethiopia and Somalia in the north
        and east and Tanzania and Uganda in the south and west. The country stretches
        from a low-lying eastern coastal strip, inland to highland regions in the
        west of the country. Kenya's western half is divided by the eastern section
        of the East African Rift, the long area of tectonic divergence which runs
        from the coasts of Djibouti, Eritrea and Somalia down through Ethiopia and
        Kenya and into Uganda, curving around the eastern edge of the Lake Victoria
        basin. There are a significant number of painted rock art sites throughout
        west-central and southern Kenya.

      title: Research history
      title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 3'
      body: 'Although researchers had been noting and investigating rock art in the
        neighbouring countries of Tanzania and Uganda from the early years of the
        20th Century, the first published mention of Kenyan rock art appeared only
        in 1946, with Joy Adamson''s descriptions of engravings at Surima, in the
        northern Turkana region. It was in the 1960s that sustained academic attention
        began to be paid to other sites in the country. In 1961 Richard Wright published
        an account of a rock shelter (now known as Kiptogot Cave) with painted images
        of cattle on the slopes of Mount Elgon near Kitale. Wright suggested potential
        parallels in style with some Ethiopian pastoralist rock art. In 1968 Robert
        Soper was the first archaeologist to investigate the unique Namoratung’a burial
        sites to the east of Lake Turkana, with their engraved standing stones, the
        interpretation of which would be continued with the work of Mark Lynch and
        Lawrence Robbins in the 1970s. In the same decade significant painting sites
        at Lake Victoria, north of the lake near the Ugandan border, and in the far
        south were also reported on by James Chaplin, Osaga Odak and Richard Gramly.
        Research and discovery has continued and is likely that many rock art sites
        in Kenya remain to be documented. As recently as 2005, 21 previously unknown
        rock art sites in the Samburu area of central Kenya were recorded during dedicated
        survey work organised by the British Institute in East Africa.    '

      title: Themes
      title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 4'
      body: "Figurative imagery only features prominently in about 10% of the known
        rock art sites of Kenya.  That which exists tends to consist of very schematic
        images of cattle, wild animals and people. The majority of both painted and
        engraved rock art iconography throughout Kenya comprises symbols, with common
        patterns including circles, sometimes concentric or containing crosses, spirals,
        parallel or cross-hatched lines and curvilinear shapes.  Circular ground  depressions
        in the rock surface, known as cupules, are also a common variant of rock art
        in Kenya, along with rock gongs, which show evidence of the use of natural
        rock formations as percussive instruments.\n\nInterpretation, cultural attribution
        and proposed dates for these works vary widely across technique and area,
        although there are common themes.  It has been suggested that the schematic
        nature and similarities in the art may point to shared East African symbolic
        understandings common to different cultural groups, for example equating circular
        shapes (some of the most popular motifs in Eastern and Central African rock
        art in general) with chieftainship or the sun, or acting as navigation devices.\n\nGiven
        the variations in distance, age and nature of the sites, there is a danger
        of generalising, but there are factors which may contribute to more incisive
        interpretations of specific sites and symbols.  One set of interpretations
        for geometric shapes in Kenyan rock art points to the similarities of certain
        of these symbols to cattle brands used by Nilotic peoples throughout Kenya,
        including the Turkana, Samburu and Masai groups.  Although the engravings
        at Namoratung'a are not thought to have been made by ancestral Turkana people,
        Lynch and Robbins noted the similarities of some of the symbols found there
        to contemporary local Turkana cattle brands.  These symbols are pecked on
        stones at graves containing mens’ remains and have been proposed to represent
        male lineages, as animal brands traditionally do in contemporary Nilotic ethnic
        groups. Further south, it is known that some more recent rock paintings representing
        brand and shield patterns were made by  Masai and Samburu men, in shelters
        used for meat-feasting—a  practice forbidden in their home compounds after
        their formal initiation as warriors—or as initiation sites. Actual representations
        of cattle are rare, with the vibrant paintings at Kakapel near the Ugandan
        border the most reknowned. Their creators are unknown although Masai and Samburu
        have been known to paint occasional schematic cattle in the past.    \n"

      title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 5'
      body: Not all of Kenya's rock art is associated with pastoralists. Much of the
        symbolic art, particularly to the south and west, is attributed to the ’Batwa’,
        ancestors of modern Batwa and related, traditionally hunter-gatherer cultural
        groups living around the Great Lakes Region of East and Central Africa.  Circular
        designs and “Sunburst” symbols are some of the most common motifs usually  associated
        with the Batwa rock art tradition; it has been proposed that they may have
        been associated  with fertility or rainmaking. Some rock art on Mfangano Island,
        in the Kenyan portion of Lake Victoria, has retained the latter association,
        having been used until the recent past by local Abasuba people for rainmaking
        purposes, despite their not having produced it originally. This re-use of
        symbolic sites in Kenya and the difficulty of dating further confuses the
        question of attribution for the art. The same rock art sites used by different
        cultural groups at different times and for different reasons. Such is the
        case at Kakapel for example, where it is posited that the earliest paintings
        may be hunter-gatherer in origin, with more recent cattle images added later,
        and Namoratung’a, with some engravings apparently hundreds of years old and
        others made within the last century.

      title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 6'
      body: It is instructive to consider the use of rock art sites within their physical
        contexts as well as the rock art motifs themselves.  Locality and landscape
        are significant, for example at Namoratung’a, where the engraved basalt pillars
        at a related nearby site have been posited to be positioned according to astronomical
        calculations, based on an ancient Cushitic calendar.  There are various ways
        in which the creation and continued use of sites in Kenya may have been significantly
        interactive, such as in the ritual playing of rock gongs, or in the potential
        use of rows of cupules as gaming boards for forms of Mancala, a token game
        common through central and Southern Africa which was originally introduced
        to Kenya via Indian Ocean trade.  It is not known if cupules were actually
        created for this purpose—it has been suggested for example that  in some areas,
        cupules were formed for purely practical purposes, in the pulverising of food
        or materials for smelting activities. In Kenya, as elsewhere, what actually
        constitutes rock art is not always easy to identify.

        art is difficult unless it is buried and associated with other uncontaminated
        organic remains and as such, scientifically dated rock art from Kenya is rare.
        \ Radiocarbon dates from human remains in graves at Namoratung’a South date
        from the mid-1st Century BC to the mid-1st Millennium AD, but as dates like
        these are not directly relatable to the rock art, researchers have tended
        to concentrate on assigning chronologies based on varying levels of patination
        and style, without being able to ascribe more than estimated production dates.
        \ \n\nThere are occasionally defining limits which aid in dating  specific
        sites, for example, cattle did not arrive in Eastern Africa until about 2,000
        BC, so representations of cattle must postdate this.  In addition, in some
        cases, artworks known to have been associated with certain groups cannot have
        been produced prior to, or post, certain dates for political reasons. For
        example, Masai paintings at Lukenya Hill are known to have been painted prior
        to 1915, as Masai people were displaced from this area by European settlers
        after this date.  \n\nThe diversity of Kenyan rock art in motif, distribution
        and cultural context so far frustrates any attempts for a cohesive chronology,
        but the continuing local engagement with rock art sites in Kenya can potentially
        serve as a useful dating and interpretive resource for researchers alongside
        continuing archaeological research."

      body: Laas Geel, one of the most important rock art sites in the region, is
        located in the north-western part of the Horn of Africa, in Somaliland, in
        the road that links Hargeisa and Berbera. The site is placed on a granite
        outcrop that rises from a plateau at an altitude of 950 meters above sea level,
        at the confluence of two seasonal rivers, a key fact to explain the existence
        of rock art in the outcrop. Even today, the name of the site (“the camel’s
        well” in Somali) makes reference to the availability of water near the surface
        of the wadis. The panels are placed at three different levels and distributed
        mostly throughout the eastern flank of the outcrop, although isolated depictions
        can be found in other slopes.

      body: The site was discovered in 2002 by a French team led by Xavier Gutherz
        which studied the beginning of Pastoralism in the Horn of Africa. Along with
        the paintings, lithic tools were found scattered throughout the site, and
        tombs marked with stelae and mounds can be seen in the neighbourhood. The
        paintings are distributed along 20 rock shelters, the biggest being around
        10 meters long. Most of them correspond to humpless cows with curved or lyre-like
        white horns (sometimes with reddish tips) and marked udders. Paintings are
        enormously colourful, including red, white, black, violet, brown and yellow
        both isolated and combined. However, the most distinctive feature of these
        cows is their necks, depicted rectangular, abnormally wide and either blank
        or infilled with red and white stripes, either straight or wavy. These strange
        necks have been interpreted as mats hanging from the actual neck, in what
        could be interpreted as a ceremonial ornament.

        are small and sometimes surrounded by a halo of radial dashes as a crown.
        These figures always appear related to the cows, either under the neck, between
        the legs or behind the hindquarters. In some cases they carry a bow, a stick
        or a shield. Along with humans and cows, dogs are well represented too, usually
        positioned near the human figures. Other animals are much scarcer: there are
        some figures that could correspond to antelopes, monkeys and two lonely depictions
        of a giraffe. Throughout most of the panels, geometric symbols are also represented,
        often surrounding the cows.'

      body: Unlike many other rock art sites, Laas Geel has been dated quite precisely
        thanks to the excavations carried out in one of the shelters by the French
        team that documented the site. During the excavation parts of the painted
        rock wall were recovered, and therefore the archaeologists have proposed a
        chronology of mid-4th to mid-3rd millennia, being one of the oldest evidences
        of cattle domestication in the Horn of Africa and the oldest known rock art
        site in this region. Unfortunately, although bovine bones were recovered from
        the excavation, they were too poorly preserved to determine whether they correspond
        to domestic or wild animals.

      body: When discovered, Laas Geel was considered a unique site, and although
        its general characteristics corresponded to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabic
        style, its specific stylistic features had no parallels in the rock art of
        the region. As research has increased, some other sites, such as Dhaga Koure,
        Dhambalin and Karin Hagane, have provided similar depictions to those of Laas
        Geel, thus reinforcing the idea of a distinctive “Laas Geel” style which nevertheless
        must be interpreted within the broader regional context.

        still waiting to be discovered and studied. Not only the quality of the images
        depicted is astonishing, but the archaeological data associated with the site
        and the landscape itself help to reconstruct a key episode in human history
        elsewhere: the moment in which animals started to be domesticated. The strong

      title: Introduction
      title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 1'
      body: Somalia is a country located at the corner of the Horn of Africa, bordered
        by Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya. Somaliland self-declared independence from
        Somalia in 1991 although the government of Somalia has not recognised this
        and views it as an autonomous region. A cultural and economic crossroads between
        Middle East, Africa and Asia, this area has historically been the centre of
        trade routes that linked these regions. It also has a very rich rock art heritage
        which has only recently been started to be studied in depth. Most of the known
        depictions correspond to painted or engraved cattle scenes, often accompanied
        by human figures, dogs and other domestic animals, although some warriors,
        camels and geometric symbols (sometimes interpreted as tribal marks) are common
        too.

      title: Geography and rock art distribution
      title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 2'
      body: 'The geography of Somaliland is characterized by a coastal semi-desert
        plain which runs parallel to the Gulf of Aden coast, crossed by seasonal rivers
        (wadis) which make possible some grazing during the rainy season. Farther
        to the south, this semi-desert plain gives rise to the Karkaar Mountains.
        These mountains, which run from Somaliland into the region of Puntland in
        Somalia, have an average height of 1800 meters above sea level and run west
        to east until Ras Caseyr (Cape Guardafui) where the north and east coasts
        of the Horn of Africa meet. Southward to the mountains there is a big, dry
        plateau known as the Ogo, whose western part (the Haud) is one of the few
        good grazing areas in the country. The Ogo plateau occupies much of central
        and eastern Somalia, which to the south is characterized by the two only permanent
        rivers in the country, the Jubba and the Shabeele, born in the Ethiopian highlands
        and running to the south. Regarding rock art, the distribution of the known
        rock art sites shows a high concentration in Somaliland, with only some sites
        located to the south in the Gobolka Hiiraan region. However, this distribution
        could be a result of lack of research in other areas. '

      title: Research history
      title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 3'
      body: A reconstruction of rock art research history is challenging due to its
        contemporary history. To begin with, during the colonial period the country
        was divided in three different territories (British, Italian and French) with
        very different trajectories, until 1960 when the British and Italian territories
        joined to create Somalia. In British Somaliland the first studies of rock
        art were carried out by Miles Burkitt and P.E. Glover in the 1940s, and the
        first general overview was published in 1954 by J.D. Clark, as a part of a
        regional synthesis of the Horn of Africa prehistory, followed by limited research
        done by Italians in the north-east region in the late 1950s. Since then, research
        has been limited, with some general catalogues published in the 1980s and
        1990s, although political instability has often prevented research, especially
        in the south-eastern region of Somalia. In fact, most rock art information
        comes from wider regional syntheses dedicated to the Horn of Africa.  In the
        early 2000’s the discovery of the Laas Geel site led to a renewed interest
        in rock art in Somaliland, which has allowed a more systematic study of archaeological
        sites. Nowadays, about 70 of these sites have been located only in this area,
        something which shows the enormous potential of rock art studies in the Horn
        of Africa.

      body: The rock art has traditionally been ascribed to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabican
        style, a term coined by Pavel Červiček in 1971 to remark the strong stylistic
        relationship between the rock art found in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian
        Peninsula. According to this proposal, there was a progressive evolution from
        naturalism to schematism, perceptible in the animal depictions throughout
        the region. Wild animals seem to be largely absent but for Djibouti, while
        cattle depictions seem to have been fundamental elsewhere, either isolated
        or in herds. Such is the case with rock art in this region, where cows and
        bulls are the most common depictions, in many cases associated to human figures
        in what seems to be reverential or ritual scenes. In some of the sites, such
        as Laas Geel, the necks of the cows have been decorated with complex geometric
        patterns interpreted as a kind of mat used in special occasions to adorn them.

      body: Along with cattle, other animals were represented (humped cows or zebus,
        dogs, sheep, dromedaries), although to a much lesser extent. Wild animals
        are very rare, but giraffes have been documented in Laas Geel and elephants
        and antelopes in Tug Gerbakele, and lions are relatively common in the schematic,
        more modern depictions. Human figures also appear, either distributed in rows
        or isolated, sometimes holding weapons. Geometric symbols are also common,
        usually associated with other depictions. In Somalia, these symbols have often
        been interpreted as tribal or clan marks. With respect to techniques, both
        engraving and painting are common, although paintings seem to be predominant.

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 6'
      body: As in many other places, the establishment of accurate chronologies for
        Somaliland rock art is challenging. In this case, the lack of long term research
        has made things more difficult, and most hypotheses have been based in stylistic
        approaches, analysis of depictions and a small set of radiocarbon data and
        archaeological excavations. According to this, the oldest depictions could
        be dated to between the mid-3rd and the 2rd millennium BC, although older
        dates have been proposed for Laas Geel. This phase would be characterized
        by humpless cows, sheep and goats as well as wild animals. These sites would
        indicate the beginning of domestication in this region, the cattle being as
        a fundamental pillar of these communities. From this starting point the relative
        antiquity of the depictions would be marked by a tendency to schematism, visible
        in the superimpositions of several rock art sites. The introduction of camels
        would mark a chronology of the end of the first millennium BC, while the date
        proposed for the introduction of zebus (humped cows) should be placed at between
        the 1st Centuries BC and AD.

      body: Since the 1st millennium BC human figures armed with lances, bows and
        shields start to appear alongside the cattle, in some cases distributed in
        rows and depicting fighting scenes against other warriors or lions. The moment
        when this last period of rock art ended is unknown, but in nearby Eritrea
        some of these figures were depicted with firearms, thus implying that they
        could have reached a relatively modern date.

        First documented in 1913 (in the Teso Report&dagger;), the geometric paintings at Nyero are among the most important and well documented rock art sites in Uganda, and are on the Tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage sites&Dagger;.

        Nyero is located in eastern Uganda in the Kumi District, about 200 km from the capital city Kampala.  It comprises six rock shelters in total, but initially only three were recorded and referred to as shrines by local communities, who had no knowledge of the origins of the paintings. The authorship of the paintings remains in some debate.

        Initially, the rock art was thought to be the work of San|Bushmen of southern Africa. However, archaeological, genetic and ethnographic evidence has subsequently attributed the paintings to the ancestors of Batwa people, hunter-gatherers who are descendants of ancient aboriginal groups once spread across East and Central Africa and most probably the original inhabitants of this landscape. Today they live in small groups near the Rwanda/Uganda border.

        More recent studies have proposed that the rock art was the work of settled human groups and not early hunter-gatherers. It has been proposed that rock shelters were used by semi-nomadic peoples devoted to animal herding, and used as reference points in the landscape. Generally positioned away from flat land, they may have served to direct herders of cattle and/or goats towards paths and water. The unknown identity of the rock artists makes dating problematic, but some of the paintings may be up to 12,000 years old.
        Notwithstanding the problems associated with attribution and chronology, many of the rock paintings in Uganda show serious damage due to long exposure to the elements. At Nyero 2, the paintings are partially covered with mineral salts, while at Nyero 5 the paintings have been destroyed or are obscured by rain wash-off. The physical condition of the paintings is testament to their antiquity.

        __Nyero Rock Art sites:__

        __Nyero 1__
        This is a small rock shelter on the outer edge of the outcrop and comprises six sets of concentric circles with a central image of a ‘floral motif’ and a so-called ‘acacia pod’ shape. The geometrics in this shelter are all painted in white.

        __Nyero 2__
        This is the main shelter, the overhang of which is formed by an enormous boulder (estimated to weigh at least 20,000 tons) which has broken away; a vertical rock against the back wall measures 10m in height. The panel at Nyero 2 consists of more than forty images such as vertical divided sausage shapes, so-called ‘canoes‘, unidentified faint markings, ‘U’ shapes, lines and dots, with evidence of superimposition; but is dominated by concentric circles. A unique feature of the paintings are the so-called ‘canoes’ or parts of ‘canoes’, so-called because of their resemblance in form. The depictions are all painted in shades of red.

        The paintings are protected from direct rain by the overhang and rocks to the front and sides protect the paintings from the sun, which is likely to have contributed to their preservation. Early users of the shelter placed ritual gifts on its south-eastern side; the tradition of using this space to place money either before or after receiving help from ancestral spirits is continued by the local community.
        As well as the rock art, a bone incised with three concentric circles and four parallel lines, and pieces of prepared ochre were excavated from this site in 1945.  These are the only evidence of prehistoric portable art so far found in Uganda.

        __Nyero 3__
        Located about eight minutes’ walk from Nyero 2, this shelter is formed by a large boulder perched on supporting rocks. Paintings consist of white concentric circles; the outer circles surrounded by double curved designs, between which are double lines divided into small compartments.

        __Nyero 4__
        This is a small shelter on the south-western side of the hill where there are a few traces of red finger-painted concentric circles, two conical shapes and lines.

        __Nyero 5__
        Situated on the western side of the hill, this shelter has a red geometric motif composed of a combination of circular and linear shapes made with both a brush and a finger. However, the images are quite difficult to distinguish as they are damaged by natural water erosion.

        __Nyero 6__
        Situated on the top of the hill, this shelter has a good view of the landscape. This site features two red finger-painted outlines of small oval shapes and a slanting L-shape as well as an outlined cross with a small circle below. The painted surface is now subject to severe exfoliation as it is open to the rain and morning sun.

        The sites at Nyero are believed locally to have been sacred ancestral places where, in the past, people would have travelled long distances to make offerings of food, beer and money in times of drought, misfortune and for child birth. Nyero was also regarded as a magical place where rain ceremonies were held. Oral histories have recorded strong attachments to the site and individual and community prayers were held seasonally. The antiquity of the images and their association with long-forgotten peoples may serve to enhance Nyero as a special and sacred place for local communities.

      body: Rock art in Uganda is mostly concentrated in the eastern part of the country,
        but more broadly sits within a regional belt of geometric rock art spanning
        East and Central Africa. It is mainly geometric in nature and includes both
        paintings (red and white being the most common pigment) and engravings; it
        comprises a basic and recurring repertoire of shapes including circular, rectangular,
        sausage, dot and lines. Concentric circles with rays emanating from them are
        a unique feature of Ugandan rock art.

        shares borders with Kenya to the east, South Sudan in the north, Democratic
        Republic of Congo in the west, and Rwanda and Tanzania in the south. It sits
        in the heart of the Great Lakes region, flanked by Lake Edward, Lake Albert
        and Lake Victoria, the latter being the second largest inland freshwater lake
        in the world, containing numerous islands. While much of its border is lakeshore,
        the country is landlocked.  Predominantly plateau, Uganda is cradled by mountains
        with Margherita peak (5,199m) on Mount Stanley the third highest point in
        Africa.

      title: Research History
      title_internal: 'Uganda: country, chapter 4'
      body: |-
        The first documentation of rock art in Uganda occurred in 1913 (Teso Report) at Nyero, a painted rock shelter of the Later Iron Age period. After its initial recording the site was subsequently cited in a 1945 excavation report (Harwich, 1961) and meticulously noted by J.C.D Lawrance during the 1950s. Only a small number of studies of Ugandan rock art rock art have been published (Wayland 1938; Lawrance 1953; Posnansky 1961; Morton 1967; Chaplin 1974), with early analyses being predominantly descriptive and highly speculative.

        The first major publications on Ugandan rock art emerged in the 1960s (Posnansky 1961; Morton 1967; Chaplin 1974) with rock art researchers proposing that the geometric and non-representational depictions served a documentary purpose of identifying cultural groups such as hunter-gatherers, cultivators or pastoralists. During this decade researchers attempted to place the rock art in a chronological framework, tying it to broader archaeological sequences. Political instability greatly impeded research during the 1970s and 1980s, although Chaplin’s thesis and in-depth survey on prehistoric rock art of Lake Victoria was published posthumously in 1974.

      body: Much of the interpretation of the rock art in the region was based on
        the assumption that the art was attributable to the so-called “Bushmen” of
        southern Africa, using these explanations to understand the rock art of Uganda.
        Catherine Namono’s (2010) recent doctoral thesis on rock art in Uganda has
        opened up these debates, “tackling the more slippery issues of attribution,
        interpretation and understanding of rock art” (Namono, 2010:40).

        attributed to the Batwa cultural group. Modern Batwa are descendants of ancient
        aboriginal forest-dwelling hunter-gatherer groups based in the Great Lakes
        region of central Africa. Their rock art has been divided into two traditions:
        firstly, the red animal tradition that comprises finely painted representations
        of animals in red pigment painted in a figurative style. These are all in
        the far north-eastern corner of Uganda. Antelope are the most common animals
        depicted, but this imagery also includes elephant, rhino, lion, leopard, giraffe,
        hyena, warthog, wild pig, ostrich and buffalo. \n"

        the majority are highly distorted and difficult to identify to species level,
        and are associated with rows of dots superimposing the animal forms. The second
        tradition, the red geometrics include images painted in red and applied with
        the fingertip; the most common motifs comprise concentric circles, concentric
        circles with radiating lines, dots, U-shapes, dotted, straight, horizontal
        and vertical lines and interlinked lines. Other motifs and shapes are described
        as ‘acacia pod’, ‘canoes’, and ‘dumbbell’; a testament to the problems researchers
        face when attempting to use descriptive terms in identifying complex designs.
        \n\n__Engravings__\n\nGeometric engravings occur in and around Lake Victoria
        and also in north-eastern Uganda. Motifs comprise concentric circles, grids,
        concentric circles with internal radiating spokes, lines and dots. Proportionally,
        there are fewer engravings than paintings but as Namono (2010) has observed
        this may reflect a research bias rather than an actual disparity.\n"

      title_internal: 'Uganda: country, chapter 9'
      body: |-
        Attempts to understand the chronology of Ugandan rock in the 1960s were based on sequences focusing on pigments used in paintings. Lawrance proposed that yellow paintings were the oldest; followed by orange, red, purple, red and white; white and dirty white were the latest in the sequence. It is highly problematic developing sequences based on pigments because of the ways in which they chemically react with particular surfaces, other pigments and the natural elements, which can compromise the integrity of the pigment. However, there appears to be a consistency (across East and Central Africa) that suggests red and white geometric paintings are the oldest and have been in existence for millennia.

        Initially thought to be the work of San Bushmen of southern Africa, archaeological, genetic and ethnographic evidence has subsequently attributed the paintings to the Batwa people, a cultural group who are today found in small groups near the Rwanda/Uganda border. If it is accepted that the geometric imagery was made by these hunter-gatherers then the rock art of Uganda probably dates from between 12,000 to 1,000 years ago.

        settled human groups and not early hunter-gatherers. Radiocarbon dating at
        Nyero (and another site at Kakoro) has dated the paintings to between 5,000
        and 1,600 years ago. It has been proposed that rock shelters were used by
        semi-nomadic peoples engaged in animal herding, which they used as reference
        points in the landscape. Generally positioned away from flat land, they may
        have served to direct herders of cattle and/or goats towards paths and water.

      title_internal: 'Uganda: country, chapter 11'
      body: A recent comprehensive study (Namono, 2010) of the potential meaning of
        geometric art in Uganda looked at the ways in which the geometric shapes in
        the rock art can be associated with the ethnographies of hunter-gatherers
        of the region. The approach proposed that the symbolism of geometric rock
        art derives from a gendered forest worldview. The forest is pivotal to hunter/gatherer
        cosmology in this region, whereby it plays a central role in cultural production
        and reproduction over time and is regarded as both male and female. The forest
        is not only a source of subsistence and well-being but informs their identity
        and the rock art reflects these complex concepts.

        the advent of colonialism influenced such traditions bringing a change in

      body: The ‘Cave of Swimmers’ is the larger of two shallow caves situated side
        by side in the southern part of the Gilf Kebir plateau in Egypt’s Western
        Desert, an area so remote and inaccessible that its existence only became
        known to European cartographers in 1926. It is so named due to the human figures
        painted on its walls with their limbs contorted as if swimming. It has since
        become world-renowned, particularly as a key location in the feature film
        *The English Patient* (1996), based on Michael Ondaatje’s novel of the same
        name.

      body: The book and film feature fictionalised versions of the cave and its real-life
        discoverer, László Almásy, as the title character. In reality, Almásy was
        a charismatic figure in pre-war Saharan exploration. He argued that the ‘swimming’
        figures suggested the prior existence of abundant water in the area and was
        therefore evidence that it had not always been arid desert, a radical new
        theory at the time that has since been confirmed, although not on the basis
        of these paintings as evidence. Rock art is notoriously difficult to date
        as it was a tradition practiced for thousands of years. These paintings have
        been dated at between 9,000 and 6,000 years ago, although some researchers
        have suggested both earlier and later dates.

        the tracks from previous parties (including Almásy’s) lie undisturbed, adding
        to the sense of history: not only of those who produced the paintings, but
        also of the site itself. Meanwhile the condition of the paintings, prone to
        flaking, continues to deteriorate, further obscuring this tantalising glimpse
        into the past.'

      title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 1'
      body: The rock art of Egypt was largely unknown outside of the region until
        the beginning of the 20th century. The rock paintings and engravings of Egypt
        feature a range of subjects and styles, including domestic cattle, wild animals,
        humans, boat images and inscriptions. Much of the rock art appears to date
        from within the last 8,000 years. However, earlier Palaeolithic engravings
        have also been found near the Nile, suggesting a longer time frame for the
        practice. The majority of Egypt’s most famous rock art, including the ‘Cave
        of Swimmers’, is found in the desert in the far south-west of the country.

        the river Nile, flows from the highlands of Ethiopia and Central Africa into

        and Eastern Deserts, with the Sinai Peninsula to the east.

      title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 3'
      body: |-
        The presence of rock art in Egypt has been noticed by European scholars since the early 19th century. Geographically isolated from the bulk of rock art in the country, the paintings and engravings of Gilf Kebir and Jebel Uweinat were first catalogued in the 1920s by the Egyptian explorers and public figures Hassanein Bey and Prince Kemal el Dine, and thereafter by renowned early twentieth century explorers and ethnographers such as László Almásy, Leo Frobenius, Ralph Bagnold and Abbé Breuil, whose expeditions helped bring Saharan rock art into wider public consciousness.

        Hans Winkler’s seminal *Rock Drawings of Southern Upper Egypt* (1938-9) was one of the first regional catalogues and remains a pre-eminent review of finds. Further cataloguing of rock art images and sites in the southern Nile valley took place at the time of the construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s. Where rock art historically was part of larger archaeological research in the area, in recent years it has been subject to more direct and rigorous study which will contribute to a better understanding of chronologies and relationships.

      title: Themes
      title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 4'
      body: In desert areas, recognisably stylised Pharaonic-period inscriptions and
        engravings from between 3,100 and 30 BC can be found on rock faces, particularly
        at oases and quarry sites such as Kharga Oasis and Wadi Hammamat in the Western
        and Eastern deserts. There is also rock art from later periods like that at
        Matna el-Barqa in the Western Desert hinterland, where both Pharaonic and
        later Coptic inscriptions mix with images of gods and horsemen. Earlier examples
        of engraved rock art may be found in the Nile valley, in what is now southern
        Egypt and northern Sudan, linked to progenitors of ancient Egyptian cultures,
        most particularly the people of the Naqada Periods (4,000-3,100 BC). This
        art is characterised by frequent depictions on pottery of river boats, which
        occur in much of the rock art near the Nile, and include, pecked on a boulder
        at Nag el-Hamdulab near Aswan, what is considered the first known depiction
        of a Pharaoh, on just such a boat. Also prevalent in these areas are numerous
        engravings of animals and human figures.

      body: Possible links between ancient Egyptian culture and wider Saharan rock
        art traditions have been discussed since the rock art of northern Africa first
        met European academic attention in the early 20th century. Although the arid
        Western Desert appears to have been a significant barrier, relations remain
        unclear.

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 6'
      body: Certainly, not all rock art found in Egypt has direct links to Pharaonic
        cultures. Recently, the rock art at Qurta, south of Edfu, of naturalistic
        outline engravings of ancient aurochs (ancestors of domestic cattle), were
        dated reliably to the Palaeolithic Period, between 16,000 and 15,000 years
        ago, making them the oldest known rock art in northern Africa. Between the
        eighth and fourth millennia BC, Egypt’s climate was generally temperate, interrupted
        only briefly by dry spells, until the increasing aridity thereafter concentrated
        life in the Eastern Sahara around the river’s banks.

      body: This development fostered both ancient Egyptian culture and isolated populations
        of animals elsewhere driven out of their environments by encroaching desert,
        some of which, like crocodiles, are represented in the rock engravings found
        along the alluvial plains. Engravings of wild fauna continue to be uncovered,
        such as that recently found near the Farafra Oasis, with depictions of giraffe
        and antelope scratched into the rock face. In a cave nearby, alongside engraved
        lion paw prints, are blown-pigment negative paintings of human hands.

      title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 8'
      body: Some of Egypt’s most striking and famous rock art is found far from the
        Nile at Gilf Kebir, a vast sandstone plateau in the desert near the Libyan
        border. As elsewhere in the Sahara, there are frequent depictions of domestic
        cattle, people and wild animals. Like most rock art, the paintings and engravings
        here are hard to date accurately but may refer to the ‘Bovidian Period’ (Pastoral
        Period) rock art of the wider Sahara, typified by paintings and engravings
        of cattle and people (Huyge, 2009). However, the scholarly community recognises
        the inherent difficulty of formulating conclusions of direct links with wider
        rock art practices. Some evidence of pastoralists in the area means that this
        rock art could have been made as early as the fifth millennium BC and are
        thus possibly contemporaneous with Predynastic Egyptian cultures, but not
        necessarily connected (Riemer, 2013).

      title: Interpretation
      title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 9'
      body: The motivation behind producing these images remains elusive. Where a
        particular cosmology is better known, it can be speculated, such as the Nile
        boat paintings have been suggested to evoke funerary beliefs and practices.
        If nothing else, the cattle paintings of Gilf Kebir demonstrate the importance
        of cattle in the pastoralist culture that produced them. Despite still being
        relatively little known, the ‘mystique’ behind rock art has cultivated popular
        curiosity, in particular in Gilf Kebir’s famous ‘Cave of Swimmers’. This is
        a shallow rock shelter featuring many painted human figures in strange contortions,
        as if swimming – images which have captured the popular imagination, with
        their glimpse of life in Egypt millennia before the Pharaohs and their hints
        at a watery Sahara.

        in the Eastern Sahara, a large rocky outcrop known as Jebel Uweinat peaks
        at an elevation of nearly 2,000 metres. The massif consists of a large, ring-shaped
        granite mass in the west, with sandstone plateaus in the east divided by deep
        valleys. Jebel Uweinat is so isolated that, until 1923, the proliferation

        with the paintings at greater altitude. The images shown here come from Karkur
        Talh, the largest of these valleys, which lies mostly in Sudan.

        in various styles, as well as other domesticates, including goats and dogs.
        The herds of cattle clearly reflect a pastoralist existence for the artists,

        of wild antelope and dog figures, as well as many engravings of camels.

      body: This variety, and similarities to rock art sites elsewhere in the eastern
        Sahara, has led to conjecture and debate regarding the date and authorship
        of these depictions. Were the engravings and paintings made by the same people?
        Does the difference in drawing styles signify authorship by different cultures
        and at different times? The difficulties in objective dating of rock art make
        these questions difficult to answer, but it seems likely that there was a
        long tradition of painting and engraving here, with much of the ‘pastoralist’
        rock art with cattle probably made between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago, some
        earlier styles possibly as much as 8,500 years ago, and other images such
        as camels made only about 2,000 years ago or less.

      body: Other than giraffes, the lack of large wild animals depicted (e.g. elephants)
        may indicate the climate to have been too dry for them, as during this time
        the area fluctuated in aridity, eventually becoming desert. There are, however,
        permanent springs at Jebel Uweinat and a more temperate microclimate here
        may have allowed pastoralists to subsist while the surrounding area became
        inhospitable. Indeed, despite its present remoteness, evidence suggests millennia
        of successive human presence, and as recently as the early 20th century, herders
        of the Toubou peoples were reported to be still living in the area. The camel
        engravings cannot be much older than 2,000 years, because camels were unknown
        in Africa before that, and the recent discovery of an ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic
        inscription from the Early Middle Kingdom serves to confirm that Jebel Uweinat
        has never really been ‘undiscovered’, despite having been unknown to Western
        geographers prior to the 20th century.

      title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 2'
      body: Sudan covers nearly 2,000,000 km² and is geographically diverse, dominated
        in the north by the desert of the southern Sahara and divided by the River
        Nile, which flows north from the capital city of Khartoum at the confluence
        of the Blue and White Niles and is joined by the Atbara River in the east.
        East of the Nile is the arid Nubian Desert, which is part of the larger Sahara,
        flanked at the north east by the Red Sea Hills and at the south by clay plains.
        To the south and west of the country are semi-arid zones with seasonal watercourses,
        with the west dominated by the Jebel Marrah volcanic massif, and the Nuba
        mountain range near the southern border.

      body: Historically, rock art research in Sudan has either been incorporated
        into larger investigations of the area’s rich archaeological history, or,
        as in the Nubian Nile valley, the result of archaeological salvage projects,
        aimed at documenting and conserving archaeological sites and artefacts in
        advance of engineered flooding events, such as the construction of the Aswan
        High dam in the 1960s and the Merowe dam in the early 2000s. This has resulted
        in significant rock art and rock gong discoveries, such as that noted near
        the Second Cataract (Žába, 1967) and more recently around the Fourth. Rock
        art remains vulnerable to damming initiatives – that at Sabu is currently
        under threat by the Kajbar Dam proposal at the Third Cataract. There is great
        scope for further research.

      title: Rock art types
      title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 4'
      body: |-
        The rock art of Sudan is varied across both time periods and geographical regions. Numerous pecked depictions of domestic cattle can be found in the Red Sea Hills (Pluskota, 2006) as well as depictions of both domestic and wild animals closer to the River Nile, such as those found at Jebel Gorgod in a mountainous area near Sesebi (Schiff Giorgini, 1972). Engravings, like those around the Second, Third, and Fourth Cataracts (areas of rocky rapids) are varied in subject matter and in date, ranging from Neolithic engravings of wild and domestic fauna to those with Medieval Christian imagery, for example around the Dal Cataract (Mills, 1965). These are mixed with others from about 4,000 BC onwards which may be contemporary with the Predynastic cultures and Pharaonic periods of ancient Egypt and in northern Sudan, Nubian Kerma culture (known to the ancient Egyptians as the Kingdom of Kush). These include depictions of Nile river boats and later hieroglyphic inscriptions.

        The peripatetic nature of these traceable signatures highlights the need to look beyond modern boundaries when considering ancient rock art traditions of Africa. For millennia prior to the creation of the current Egypt/Sudan border, the highway of the river allowed movement between Egypt and Nubia, the people of the region leaving their marks on a narrow area of fertile land that fostered riverine animals like crocodiles, which are occasionally depicted in the rock engravings. From the 4th millennium BC, following several temperate millennia, savannah animals like giraffe lost their habitat in the increasingly arid environments to east and west, but remain reflected in the rock engravings of what is now desert.

        The range in styles and dates for Sudanese rock art emphasises its nature, not as a particular artistic style, but as personal and cultural manipulations of a specific medium. A number of stone percussive instruments known as rock gongs, which produce a sonorous tone when struck and are often apparently associated with cattle engravings, have stimulated discussion about the uses of rock art sites as multisensory ritual venues.

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 5'
      body: The understanding of much of Sudanese prehistory as it relates to rock
        art remains subject to debate. Some of the best-preserved and most varied
        rock art of Sudan’s desert regions is situated only metres from the Egyptian
        border in the far north-west corner of the country, in a valley of Jebel Uweinat
        – the enormous sandstone and granite outcrop which serves as a boundary between
        Egypt, Sudan and Libya. Numerous paintings and engravings are found here,
        including images of wild animals, such as giraffe and antelope, humans, dogs
        and many cattle. Some of these paintings have been compared with other styles
        of rock art in the wider Sahara, including the later Pastoral Period (Muzzolini,
        1995). Others have proposed that a different set of paintings in these sites
        may be older, with a stylistic link (although fragile) with the Round Head
        Period (Van Noten,1978). However, the scholarly community recognises the inherent
        difficulty of formulating conclusions of direct links with wider rock art
        practices. In areas around the Nile, where there are similar animal engravings,
        rock art is also from a wide range of time periods.

      body: 'Ascribing dates to rock art like that at Jebel Uweinat is also uncertain
        and is more difficult than dating images such as the depictions of Nile river
        boats or later Christian cross engravings like those found near the Third
        Cataract, where similar motifs are replicated on contemporary pottery and
        corroborated elsewhere in the archaeological record. Occasionally rock art
        may be found in a dateable stratigraphic context- a giraffe engraving at Gala
        Abu Ahmed in Wadi Howar, an ancient Nile tributary, was recently dated to
        before 1,200-1,300 BC in this way (Jesse, 2005). In general, other clues are
        necessary, for example known domestication dates: wild animal images are often
        superseded with depictions of animals like horses and camels. These were only
        widely known in northeast Africa from the second and first millennia BC respectively
        and are therefore unlikely to be older. However, this is not an exact science:
        examination of the superimpositions and levels of patination on some Nile
        valley cattle engravings show that they were made over thousands of years
        up to the not too distant past. Faced with such challenges, classifying rock
        art by design style, while problematic, can prove useful in envisioning chronology.'

      body: Running from the Red Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, the Sahara is by far the
        world's largest hot desert. It covers over 3,500,000 square miles (9,000,000
        sq. km), a tenth of the whole African Continent. Yet we know it was not always
        so. Archaeological and geological research has shown that the Sahara has undergone
        major climatic changes since the end of the last Ice Age (c. 10,000 BC). During
        this period, rain was far more abundant, and vast areas of the current desert
        were a savannah. By around 4,200 BC, changes in the rainfall and seasonal
        patterns led to a gradual desertification of the Sahara into an arid expanse.
        The analysis of archaeological sites, animal bones and preserved vegetal remains
        tell us of a greener world, where some of the earliest attempts at domestication
        of animals and rudimentary farming took place.

      body: |-
        Little is known about the people who lived in the Sahara thousands of years ago; however, through rock art, we can discern who they may have been and what images were important to them. Throughout the desert, rock art engravings and paintings depict an earlier story of the Sahara: the wild animals that lived there; the cattle herds that provided food and labour; their daily activities and beliefs are all displayed in caves and cliffs, valleys or plateaus.

        The Messak Settafet is one of these places. Situated in the Sahara, it is a large plateau running southwest to northeast through the Libyan province of Fezzan, near the borders of Algeria and Niger. Both plateaus are crossed by numerous wadis (dry riverbeds) that run to the east, flanked by cliffs filled with tens of thousands of rock art depictions, including some of the oldest engravings in the Sahara. Rich with depictions of the savannah, the rock art shows buffaloes, crocodiles, ostriches or hippopotami, all of which tells us of a wetter Sahara thousands of years ago.

        It is difficult to determine the motives of the people that created these images. There are many theories about why these people created rock art, what exactly is depicted and what the images meant to that group. One area of particular research interest is the depiction of mythical beings, therianthropic figures (part human part animal) and anthropomorphic animals (the personification of animals in human forms). Were these religious images? Cultural folklore? Or simply images pleasing to a group or culture?

      body: The technical quality of the engravings is exceptional, with deeply outlined
        and carefully polished bodies and carved cupules within their heads to depict
        eyes. Claws were also marked, maybe to reinforce the idea of fighting. The
        specific type of animal depicted is subject to debate among scholars. Some
        have described them as monkeys or mythological blends of monkeys and men.
        Their pointed ears could also identify them as cat-like figures, although
        most probably they were the representation of mythical beings, considering
        their prominence above all other figures in this area. A polished line comes
        out from the waist of both figures to join four small ostriches, depicted
        between them, which often accompany rock art in this region.

        body of the figure to the left a small, delicate figure of a woman was shallowly
        engraved. Hair, fingers and breasts were carefully depicted, as well as an
        unidentified symbol placed at the bottom of the figure, which could have a
        fertility-related meaning. The difference in style and technique may point
        to the woman as a later addition to the panel, taking advantage of the polished
        surface, but respecting the main scene.

        Another example of fighting cats has been found nearby, although it is neither so carefully made nor in such a prominent place. The similarity is, however, astonishing, and we may wonder if this second pair of beings could be a copy of the first pair, thus reflecting its symbolic importance in the people’s collective imagination.

        As is often the case with rock art, the interpretation of these images remains up for discussion. Given the care taken to engrave the images, their technical quality and their dominant position in the landscape, we can gather that these images potentially had deep meaning for the people who created them thousands of years ago, and were possibly meant to be a symbolic as well as a physical landmark for travellers and local people alike. Although the original purpose and meaning have long since been lost, the expressive power of the engravings still remains, allowing us to gain a small view into the world of the people that lived in the Sahara thousands of years ago, when it was a sprawling green savannah.

      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 1'
      body: 'Rock art occurs in two main areas in Libya: the Tadrart Acacus and the
        Messak Plateau. The oldest works of rock art, from the Acacus Mountains, are
        engravings of mammals from the Wild Fauna Period (Early Hunter Period) and
        could be up to 12,000 years old. Thousands of paintings dating from up to
        8,000-9,000 years ago show a diversity of imagery and include scenes of hunting,
        pastoralism, daily life, dancing and a variety of wild and domesticated animals.
        The Messak Plateau is home to tens of thousands of engravings, and only a
        few paintings have been located in this region to date. The area is best known
        for larger-than-life-size engravings of animals such as elephants, rhino and
        bubalus (a now extinct buffalo), and some of the most iconic depictions in
        Saharan rock art, such as the ‘Fighting Cats’ scene.'

      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 2'
      body: The fourth largest country in Africa, Libya is located in the Maghreb
        region of North Africa, bordered on the west by Tunisia and Algeria, Egypt
        to the east, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. Except for the narrow
        strip along the coast, where 80% of the population resides, Libya lies entirely
        within the Sahara Desert. The main areas of rock art lie in the south-western
        corner of the country, with the Tadrart Acacus continuing into south-eastern
        Algeria, where they are simply known as the Tadrart. The Acacus in Libya and
        the Tadrart in Algeria are now listed and combined as a trans-frontier World
        Heritage Site by UNESCO, linking these two geographically divided sites into
        a cultural whole.

      body: The Messak rock art has been known to Europeans since Heinrich Barth’s
        expedition in 1850, although it was not until 1932 that the engravings were
        methodically studied by Leo Frobenius. Some initial interpretative hypotheses
        about the rock art in the Acacus were formulated in the late 1930s by Italian
        archaeologist Paolo Graziosi. Subsequently, the region became the subject
        of systematic investigation by Fabrizio Mori, another Italian archaeologist,
        who also published the first scientific papers on Libyan rock art in the 1960s.
        Since then, consistent surveying has continued in this region and stratigraphic
        excavations of archaeological deposits have established a cultural sequence
        dating back to the Holocene Period.

      title: Chronology and early rock art
      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 4'
      body: |-
        Rock art chronology in North Africa is based largely on the combination of stylistic features, superimposition, subject matter and the degree of weathering or patina. While not an exact science, chronological periods are recognisable in the depictions, which generally correspond to climatic and environmental phases. Some of the oldest images are found on the Messak plateau and represent a Sahara that was significantly wetter and more fertile than today, exemplified by representations of large mammals – some of which are aquatic species – incised into the rock faces.

        The chronology of the Tadrart Acacus during the Holocene has been established more firmly through the excavation and dating of archaeological sites. Based on this evidence, these earliest images may coincide with the first Holocene occupation of the area by specialised hunter-gatherers – known as the 'Early Acacus' Period – which some researchers date to around 11,000 years ago.

      title: Round Head Period
      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 5'
      body: From around 9,000 years ago, the archaeological record in the Acacus changes;
        sites are larger, featuring more formalised stone structures with heavy grinding
        equipment and large pots. Subsistence strategies based on hunting and gathering
        remain, but archaeological evidence suggests the presence of corralling Barbary
        sheep and the storage of wild cereals. Fragments of grinding stones with traces
        of colour from the Takarkori rock shelter, dating from between 6,800–5,400
        BC, may have been used as palettes for rock or body painting, and have been
        connected chronologically to the Round Head Period. A large proportion of
        paintings in this period portray very large figures with round, featureless
        heads and can often be depicted in ‘floating’ positions; women often have
        their hands raised, interpreted as postures of supplication.

      title: Pastoral Period
      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 6'
      body: The introduction of domesticates into the region has been identified archaeologically
        at around 8,000 years ago, although full exploitation of cattle for dairying
        is much later at around 6,000 years ago. The development to full pastoral
        systems in the region is complex and prolonged, so it is challenging to track
        any changes from the rock art itself, but the painting of large herds must
        be connected to a full pastoral society.

      title: Horse and Camel Periods
      title_internal: 'Libya: country, chapter 7'
      body: |-
        Historical records have tended to date the introduction of both the horse and the camel in northern Africa rather than the archaeological record. Yet, in terms of rock art research in this region, less attention has been given to these styles; the reason for this may be that the earliest rock art attracted more scholarly consideration than the later depictions. However, their representation certainly demonstrates the changing natural and cultural environment and associated human responses and adaptations.

        The rock art of Libya is a visual testament to the changing fortunes of this part of the Sahara and the cultural groups who have occupied and navigated the area over thousands of years. The engravings and paintings act as a legacy, tracing the environmental effects of climate change, how people have adapted to that change and the cultural worlds they have created.

        These skilfully engraved images depict long-horned cattle with their heads bowed. Thought to date between 7,000 and 8,000 years ago, today these images stand alone in a vast wilderness of sand and rock. However, this environment was once wetter and more fertile, and this site may have been close to a local watering hole where animals regularly drank and bathed. Indeed, even today during the rains, the depression in the sand at the base of the inselberg fills up with water, which gives the appearance that the cows are bending their heads to drink.

        These engravings are incorporated in a local myth that tells of a shepherd who engraved the crying cows after travelling night and day with his herd to a spring he thought would quench their thirst. Finding it dry, he captured in stone his cattle’s grief as he watched them die one by one. Climatic data has shown a number of significant cooling events in the North Atlantic, one of which – dating to around eight thousand years ago – resulted in a period of aridity lasting a number of centuries across the Sahara, and may coincide with these engravings and of the associated myth.

      body: In artistic terms, the execution of this panel of engraved cows is extremely
        accomplished and testifies to someone who was not only a skilful carver but
        who we might even regard as a sculptor in the modern sense, who understood
        both materials and the interplay of light and shade in the reductive process
        of carving. But even more than this, the artist understood the environmental
        conditions in which he was working. It has been observed that the depth and
        thickness of the engraved lines has been carefully calculated to ensure that
        as the sun travels across them during the day, they appear to move. This sense
        of movement is made most acute as the evening shadows, falling into each groove,
        give the cattle a sense of mass and movement. Other artistic devices, such
        as double lines with recessed areas and internal polishing, evoke a perception
        of depth and density. The interplay of light and shade is consummately adept
        and dynamic, and the sculptural quality of the image sensorially evocative.
        This is the work of a practised craftsman, who demonstrates a deep of understanding
        of materials, techniques and the natural environment.

      title: Introduction
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 1'
      body: Algeria is Africa’s largest country geographically and has long been noted
        for its rich concentrations of rock art, particularly in the Tassili n’Ajjer,
        inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. More than 15,000 paintings
        and engravings, some of which date back up to 12,000 years, provide unique
        insights into the environmental, social, cultural and economic changes in
        the country across a period of 10,000 or more years. The area is particularly
        famous for its Round Head paintings, first described and published in the
        1930s by French archaeologist Henry Lhote.

      title: Geography
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 2'
      body: Algeria is situated in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered on
        the west by Morocco and on the east by Tunisia and Libya, with a long Mediterranean
        coastline to the north. The Atlas Mountains cross Algeria east to west along
        the Mediterranean coast. The northern portion of the country is an area of
        mountains, valleys, and plateaus, but more than 80% of the country falls within
        the Sahara Desert. Rock art is located in the Algerian Maghreb and the Hoggar
        Mountains but the richest zone of rock art is located in the mountain range
        of Tassili n'Ajjer, a vast plateau in the south-east of the country. Water
        and sand erosion have carved out a landscape of thin passageways, large arches,
        and high-pillared rocks, described by Lhote as 'forests of stone'.

      title: Research history
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 3'
      body: |-
        Rock art in Algeria, notably the engravings in South Oran, has been the subject of European study since 1863. Notable surveys were made by A. Pomel (1893-1898), Stéphane Gsell (1901-1927), G. B. M. Flamand (1892-1921), Leo Frobenius and Hugo Obermaier (1925), Henri Breuil (1931-1957), L. Joleaud (1918-1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (1935-1955). Henri Lhote visited the area in 1955 and 1964, completing previous research and adding new descriptions included in a major publication on the area in 1970.

        The rock art of the Tassili region was introduced to Western eyes as a result of visits and sketches made by French legionnaires, in particular a Lt. Brenans during the 1930s. On several of his expeditions, Lt. Brenans took French archaeologist Henri Lhote who went on to revisit sites in Algeria between 1956-1970 documenting and recording the images he found. Regrettably, some previous methods of recording and/or documenting have caused damage to the vibrancy and integrity of the images.

      title: Early rock art
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 4'
      body: The earliest pieces of rock art are engraved images reflecting a past
        vibrant fertile environment teeming with life and includes elephant, rhinoceros,
        hippopotamus and fish as well as numerous predators, giraffe, and plains animals
        such as antelope and gazelle. When human figures are depicted in this period
        they are very small in stature and hold throwing sticks or axes. More than
        simply hunting scenes, they are likely to reflect people’s own place within
        their environment and their relationship with it.

      title: Round Head Period
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 5'
      body: The area is especially famous for its Round Head paintings. Thought to
        be up to 9,000 years old, some of these paintings are the largest found on
        the African continent, measuring up to 13 feet in height. The Round Head period
        comprises depictions of figures with round, featureless heads and formless
        bodies, often appearing to be ‘floating’. Some features or characteristics
        of Round Head paintings found on the Tassili plateau are unique to the area,
        and the depiction of certain motifs may have held special significance locally,
        making particular sites where they occur the locus of rites, ritual or ceremonial
        activity. The majority of animal depictions are mouflon (wild mountain sheep)
        and antelope, but they are represented only in static positions and not as
        part of a hunting scene.

      title: Pastoral Period
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 6'
      body: The subsequent Pastoral Period, from around 7,500-4,000 years ago, portrays
        a very different world to the preceding ethereal Round Head period and coincides
        with the transition from a temperate Sahara towards aridification. Images
        are stylistically varied, which may attest to the movement of different cultural
        groups. Depictions now include domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep,
        goats and dogs; scenes portray herders, men hunting with bows, and representations
        of camp life with women and children – in essence, scenes that reference more
        settled communities.

      title: Horse Period
      title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 7'
      body: |-
        Desertification across the Sahara required new methods of traversing and utilising the landscape; depictions of horses (often with riders) and of chariots indicate this change. Horse-drawn chariots are often depicted at a ‘flying’ gallop and are likely to have been used for hunting rather than warfare.

        Libyan-Berber script, used by ancestral Berber peoples, started to appear in association with images. However, the meaning of this juxtaposition of text and image remains an enigma, as it is indecipherable to modern day Tuareg.

        Oukaïmeden is an alpine-like valley set 2,630 metres above sea level at the core of Morocco’s High Atlas. Records from the 16th century onwards refer to its seasonal profit as summer pasturage by herders coming from villages settled at mid-altitude. It is a well-known place due to the existence of a ski resort, and a well-frequented tourist destination for people coming from Marrakech during the summer. It is also home to one of the most impressive collections of rock art engravings in Morocco, with about 250 rock art sites and one thousand depictions scattered throughout the valley.
        Oukaïmeden rock art has been thoroughly studied by Malhome (1959, 1961) and Rodrigue (1999), and along with the Yagour plateau and Jbel Rat constitute the core of High Atlas rock art.

      body: High Atlas rock art is remarkably different not only from the rest of
        Moroccan rock art, but also from most other depictions documented throughout
        the Sahara. Although some of the engravings correspond to cattle depictions
        similar to those of nearby regions, there are other images known only in this
        region. One particular type comprises detailed, large human figures represented
        frontally, surrounded by weapons and other symbols. Another common kind of
        depiction is circular shapes with inner designs, which most probably represent
        shields. Weapons are also very common, usually depicted in isolation, but
        not held by warriors as is common in most of the North African images. Together
        with these themes, Oukaïmeden is characterised by a significant number of
        elephant representations (something surprising considering its altitude!)
        and a huge number of complex, geometric symbols whose interpretation remains
        obscure.

      body: Chronologically speaking, it seems Oukaïmeden engravings started to appear
        during the mid-3rd millennium BC, when the Sahara desert became increasingly
        drier and summer grazing became more and more important. The earliest depictions
        consisted mainly of animals, especially cattle, which was the species that
        benefited the most from green pastures. As time passed, pressure on this resource
        grew and tensions arose among the communities that used the valley. From the
        2nd millennium BC onwards, animal depictions were replaced by images of weapons
        and warriors, showing a different, more violent way of reclaiming rights over
        pastures. That situation continued during the long Libyan-Berber period that
        started around the mid-1st millennium BC and lasted until the Muslim conquest
        of the area, around the 7th century AD. The arrival of Islam does not imply
        the immediate disappearance of rock art engravings, but their number decreased
        significantly and they progressively lost their significance, becoming incidental
        in Oukaïmeden history.

        Although Oukaïmeden rock art is distributed throughout the valley, there are some sites with scenes that stand above the rest due to their complexity and significance. One of them is the so-called Elephants’ Frieze, a horizontal rock face where four elephants, a feline, a rhinoceros or warthog and two human figures facing the animals were depicted. Two later, vertical Libyan-Berber inscriptions were added to the panel. The scene is placed near a shelter, facing a stream which constitutes one of the main access routes to the valley grazing areas.

        The relevance of Oukaïmeden rock art is renowned, and the whole area has been protected since 1951 by the Moroccan government, while the National Centre of Rock Art Heritage in Marrakech has carried on several research projects in the area. However, the interest in the site doesn’t mean its preservation is assured: the growing incidence of tourism, the extraction of stones for building purposes in nearby Marrakech and vandalism are threats that have still to be dealt with. The fragile environment of Oukaïmeden valley adds an extra concern about the preservation of one of the most complete and better-preserved rock sites in Morocco.

      title: Introduction
      title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 1'
      body: 'Morocco is located at the north-western corner of Africa, in a unique
        area forming a link between the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, Europe
        and Africa. More than 300 rock art sites have been documented in the country
        so far, mainly located in two areas: the High Atlas Mountains, and the Sahara
        desert region to the south and east. They comprise mainly engravings, which
        could be up to 5,000 years old, and include domestic and wild animals, warriors,
        weapons and scenes of battles and hunting. Antelope and cattle are the most
        represented animals in Moroccan rock art, although elephants and rhinoceros
        are common too.'

      title: Geography and rock art distribution
      title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 2'
      body: Morocco has a very variable geography, with the Atlas Mountains crossing
        the country from the southwest to the northeast and separating the coastal
        plains to the west from the Sahara Desert that runs to the east and south.
        The distribution of rock art in the country is very irregular, with some zones
        crowded with sites and others almost devoid of depictions. The two main areas
        of rock art sites are the High Atlas zone and the area to the east and south
        of the Atlas Mountains. The first area groups more than seven thousand engravings
        around the Oukaïmeden valley, the Yagour plateau and the Jebel Rat site. They
        are at high altitude (more than 2000 metres above sea level), and mainly represent
        weapons, cattle and anthropomorphic figures, along with numerous geometric
        symbols.

      title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 3'
      body: The second main zone, an arid region where the majority of Moroccan rock
        art sites are situated, contains the oldest engravings in the country, some
        of them linked to the Saharan styles. The variety of themes depicted is wide,
        from abundant scenes of riders to isolated animals or complex geometric symbols.
        This collection comprises about seven hundred images, most of them corresponding
        to the southern area of Morocco around the Draa valley and the town of Tata,
        although a High Atlas (Oukaïmeden) site is also included.

      title: Research history
      title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 4'
      body: 'European audiences began studying the rock art in Morocco decades after
        the study of rock art in Algeria and Libya, with the first news of rock art
        coming from French and German travellers late in the 19th century. The most
        significant boost came after the Treaty of Fes in 1912, when the presence
        of the colonial authorities led indirectly to an increasing knowledge of rock
        art sites, as Spanish and French officers started to show interest in the
        engravings. However, it was not until after Moroccan independence in 1956
        that systematic research began throughout the country. Since then, archaeological
        information has progressively grown, although regional syntheses are still
        scarce: only the Atlas (Malhomme, Rodrigue) and part of southern Morocco (Simoneau)
        have exhaustive catalogues of sites. The first comprehensive study of Moroccan
        rock art was made in 2001 (Searight), when for the first time, a global approach
        to Moroccan rock art areas, themes and chronology was undertaken.'

      title: Themes
      title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 5'
      body: 'As in most countries, mammals are the most frequent depictions, especially
        cattle, horses and different types of antelope. Many other animals, such as
        giraffes, elephants, rhinoceros, dromedaries or lions are depicted, if more
        scarcely. The second main theme is human figures, especially in the south
        of the country, where depictions of Libyan-Berber riders are very common.
        In the High Atlas area they are usually depicted isolated, surrounded by weapons,
        which are another big theme in Moroccan rock art: a panoply of these can be
        seen, including daggers, bows and arrows, spears, shields, axes and halberds.'

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'Morocco: country, chapter 6'
      body: A consensus has yet to be achieved about Moroccan rock art chronology
        between the supporters of a long chronology, starting around 4000 BC, and
        those that defend a short one, from 2500 BC onwards. The oldest engravings
        represented in Moroccan rock art correspond to the Tazina and Pecked Cattle
        styles, depicting mainly mammals. From the second half of the second millennium
        BC onwards, depictions of human figures start to appear in the High Atlas,
        associated with daggers and shields, defining the so-called Dagger/Halberd/Anthropomorph
        style. During the first millennium BC, Libyan-Berber hunting and battle scenes
        start to appear in southern Morocco; riders, infantrymen and animals depicted
        in a very schematic style. The last period of Moroccan rock art, as in the
        rest of the Sahara, is the so-called Camel Period, characterized by the appearance
        of dromedaries.

      body: Dabous is located in north-eastern Niger, where the Ténéré desert meets
        the slopes of the Aïr Mountains. The area has been part of the trans-Saharan
        caravan trade route traversed by the Tuareg for over two millennia, but archaeological
        evidence shows much older occupation in the region dating back 8,000 years.
        More recently, it has become known to a wider global audience for its exceptional
        rock art.

        Recorded in 1987 by French archaeologist Christian Dupuy, two remarkable life-size engravings of giraffe have generated much interest due to the size, realism and technique of the depictions. The two giraffe, thought to be one large male in front of a smaller female, were engraved on the weathered surface of a sandstone outcrop. The larger giraffe measures 5.4 m from top to toe and combines several techniques of production, including scraping, smoothing and deep engraving of the outlines.

        Each giraffe has an incised line emanating from its mouth or nose, meandering down to a small human figure. This motif is not unusual in Saharan rock art, but its meaning remains a mystery. Interpretations have suggested the line may indicate that giraffe were hunted or even domesticated, or may reflect a religious, mythical or cultural association. It has also been suggested that the lines and human figures were later additions.

        The engravings cannot be seen from ground level; they are only visible by climbing onto the boulder. They are thought to date from between 6,000 and 8,000 years ago – a period known as the Neolithic Subpluvial, when environmental conditions were much wetter and the Sahara was a vast savannah stretching for thousands of miles, able to sustain large mammals such as giraffe. The soft sandstone is likely to have been incised using a harder material such as flint; there are chisels of petrified wood in the surrounding desert sands which would have acted as good tools for abrading and polishing outlines. It is easy to imagine people in the past sitting on the rocky outcrop watching these long-necked, graceful animals and immortalising them in stone for future generations.

        We can only speculate as to why the giraffe was selected for this special treatment. Any number of physical, behavioural, environmental or symbolic factors may have contributed to its significance.

        While the giraffe have taken centre stage at this site because of their size and the skill of the execution, a systematic study of the area has identified 828 further engravings, including 704 zoomorphs (animal forms), 61 anthropomorphs (human forms), and 17 inscriptions of Tifinâgh script. The animals identified include: bovines (cattle ) (46%), ostrich (16%), antelope and gazelle (16%), giraffe (16%), and finally 12 dromedaries (camels), 11 canids (dog-like mammals), 6 rhinoceros, 3 equids (horses or donkeys), 2 monkeys, 2 elephants, and 1 lion.

        Who might the artists have been? It is often the case in rock art research that artists are lost to us in time and we have little or no archaeological evidence that can offer insights into the populations that occupied these sites, sometimes only for a short time. However, in 2001 a site called Gobero was discovered that provides a glimpse of life in this region at the time that the Dabous engravings were produced.

      body: Gobero is located at the western tip of the Ténéré desert in Niger, approximately
        150 km south-east of the Aïr Mountains. Situated on the edge of a paleaolake
        and dating from the early Holocene (7,700–6,200 years ago), it is the earliest
        recorded cemetery in the western Sahara and consists of around 200 burials.
        Skeletal evidence shows both male and females to be tall in stature, approaching
        two metres. Some of the burials included items of jewellery, including a young
        girl wearing a bracelet made from the tusk of a hippo, and a man buried with
        the shell of a turtle.

        was based on fishing (Nile perch, catfish, soft-shell turtles) and hunting
        (hippos, bovids, small carnivores and crocodiles). Microlithis, bone harpoon
        points and hooks, as well as ceramics with dotted wavy-line and zig-zag impressed
        motif were found in burials, refuse areas and around the lake. A hiatus in
        the occupation of the area (6,200–5,200 years ago) occurred during a harsh
        arid interval, forcing the occupants to relocate. The Gobero population may
        not be the artists responsible for Dabous, but archaeological evidence can
        help formulate a picture of the environmental, social and material culture
        at the time of the engravings.

        result of human intervention such as trampling, graffiti and fragments being
        stolen. As a result, the decision was made to preserve them by making a mould
        of the carvings in order to make a cast in a resistant material. Permission
        was granted by both the government of Niger and UNESCO and in 1999 the moulding
        process took place. The first cast of the mould, made in aluminium, stands
        at the airport of Agadez in the small desert town near the site of Dabous
        – an enduring symbol of the rich rock art heritage of the country.

      title: Introduction
      title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 1'
      body: Niger is geographically diverse, having both the Sahel (savannah) and
        the Sahara (desert). The majority of the country’s rock art – made up predominantly
        of engravings – is located in the northern desert area, in and around the
        Aïr Mountains, where some of the art is thought to be several thousand years
        old. The Djado Plateau in the north-east is also rich in art that includes
        both paintings and engravings. One of the most celebrated sites of rock engraving
        is at a place called Dabous, to the west of the mountains. Here, two life-size
        giraffe were carved on the top of an outcrop, and may be up to 6,000 years
        old. Other notable areas for engravings are Iwellene in the northern Aïr Mountains,
        where some of the art is thought to be several thousand years old, as well
        the sites of Tanakom and Tagueit in the south-eastern Aïr Mountains, where
        engravings are located on the sides of two wadis (dry riverbeds).

      body: Links have been made between the rock art of Niger and that of several
        other countries – in particular, between the so-called Libyan Warrior art
        found in the Aïr Mountains and the rock engravings of the Adrar des Iforas
        in Mali. Stylistic similarities also exist with some of the art of the Tadrart
        (Acacus) and in south-east Algeria. Further associations have been made between
        the Early Hunter art of the Djado Plateau and art in south-west Libya and
        south-east Algeria. Equally, similarities have been observed with the Tazina-style
        engravings in south-western Algeria and south-eastern Morocco.

      title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 4'
      body: Consisting predominantly of engravings, the majority of depictions in
        this region fall within the so-called Libyan Warrior period or style of art,
        dating from 1,500–3,000 years ago, characterised by forward-facing figures
        with metal weapons and horses. Approximately 1,000 engravings of warriors
        have been recorded from the Aïr Mountains in Niger, as well as the Adrar des
        Iforas in bordering Mali. Based on investigations into the garments worn,
        accessories, headdresses and weaponry, and by studying the placement and superimposition
        of images, it has been proposed that there are two main stages of this Libyan
        Warrior rock art. The oldest is linked to a pastoral economy based on cattle-rearing,
        when metal had been introduced to the region and the use of the spear took
        over from the traditional bow. This region also hosts images of wild animals
        such as Barbary sheep and ostrich, as well as cattle.

      body: The number of cattle depictions is small, but particular images of calves
        attached to a lead can be compared stylistically with images of cattle in
        Tassili n’Ajjer, Algeria. Moreover, Henri Lhote noted the resemblance between
        these rock art depictions and the husbandry practices of the present day Wodaabe
        people of Niger, who use a similar calf rope. The calf rope (a long rope comprising
        loops within which the heads of the calves are secured) is both practical
        and symbolic, ensuring the cows always return to their home camp, while also
        physically dividing the camp into male and female halves. It is interesting
        to note the close relationship between the rock art of regions that today
        are politically discrete.

      title: History of rock art discovery in Niger
      title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 7'
      body: Until relatively recently rock art research has been sporadic in Niger.
        In the 1920s Major Gen. Francis Rodd, a British explorer and army officer,
        made two great expeditions into the Sahara. He was the first person to make
        a serious study of the Tuareg and documented some of the rock art in the Aïr
        Mountains. Subsequently, French colonial officers noted some sites around
        1960. However, it was French archaeologist Henri Lhote who undertook major
        recording programmes throughout the 1960s and 1970s to document, trace and
        publish several thousand engravings. Very little information is known relating
        the rock art to known cultural groups, either past or present. Most of the
        sites were not habitation sites, and were probably only occasionally visited
        by nomadic societies in the past, so very little (if any) archaeological evidence
        remains. Most of the art predates the residence of the Tuareg, who now inhabit
        this area and who appear to have no direct connections with the art. The Tuareg
        recognise old script which sometimes accompanies images as it closely resembles
        their own writing, *Tifinagh*; however, it is incomprehensible to them if
        it is more than 100 years old.

      body: Early Hunter or Bubalus Period rock engravings are executed with deeply
        incised and smoothened lines, mainly depicting big game such as elephants,
        rhinoceros, giraffe and other game (with rhinoceros occurring most often),
        and are found on the Djado Plateau, as well as the Mangueni and Tchigai plateaux
        in north-east Niger. In the eastern Aïr Mountains, archaeological traces of
        human occupation during this early wet phase are evident, dating back 9,500
        years.

      body: Although the Bovidian Period is sparsely represented in comparison to
        other rock art regions, both on the Djado Plateau and the Aïr Mountains, this
        period can probably be dated to between 7,000 and 4,000 years ago. A few cattle
        are depicted in a similar fashion to the big game of the Early Hunter Period,
        which raises the question of whether the nomadic cattle-herding culture emerged
        from a hunting lifestyle, or at least rapidly succeeded it.

        generally agreed, the Tazina period in Morocco is dated from c.5,000–2,000
        BC.

      title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 12'
      body: Consisting predominantly of rock engravings and found in the Aïr Mountains,
        the Horse Period and Libyan Warrior Period date from around 3,000–1,500 years
        ago. Depictions are of horses with so-called Libyan Warriors, with metal weapons
        or with chariots and charioteers. Human figures, which often appear with horses,
        were sometimes depicted with elaborate apparel; others were drawn with stylized
        bodies consisting of two triangles joined at the apex. Wild animals such as
        Barbary sheep and ostrich, as well as cattle, appear in this art. Art of the
        Horse Period is not widely represented in the Djado Plateau, suggesting that
        Berber groups did not reach the region in any great numbers – but it has been
        proposed that certain peculiarities of style may suggest an influence from
        Aïr.

        Plateau, but as camels were introduced to the Sahara up to 2,000 years ago,
        the relative lack of depictions suggests that the plateau was scarcely frequented
        during this hyper-arid period.

      body: The Ennedi Plateau is a mountainous region in the north-eastern corner
        of Chad, an impressive sandstone massif eroded by wind and temperature changes
        into series of terraces, gorges, cliffs and outliers. Although it is part
        of the Sahara, the climate of the Ennedi Plateau is much more suitable for
        human habitation than most of the desert, with regular rain during summer,
        wadis (seasonal rivers) flowing once or twice a year, and a relatively large
        range of flora and fauna – including some of the few remaining populations
        of Saharan crocodiles west of the Nile. Throughout the caves, canyons and
        shelters of the Ennedi Plateau, thousands of images – dating from 5000 BC
        onwards – have been painted and engraved, comprising one of the biggest collections
        of rock art in the Sahara and characterised by a huge variety of styles and
        themes.

      body: 'Within this kaleidoscope, a series of engravings have become especially
        renowned for their singularity and quality: several groups of life-sized human
        figures depicted following very regular stylistic conventions. They were first
        reported internationally in the early 1950s; during the following decades
        more sites were discovered, almost all of them around Wadi Guirchi, and especially
        near a site known as Niola Doa. To date, six sites have been documented, totalling
        about 40 depictions. Most of the figures were engraved on big, vertical boulders,
        in groups, although occasionally they appear isolated. They follow a very
        regular pattern: most of them are life-sized or even bigger and are represented
        upright facing right or left, with one arm bent upwards holding a stick resting
        over the neck or shoulder and the other arm stretched downwards. In some cases,
        the figures have an unidentified, horizontal object placed at the neck, probably
        an ornament. Interspersed among the bigger figures, there are smaller versions
        which are slightly different, some of them with the arms in the same position
        as the others but without sticks, and some facing forwards with hands on hips.
        In general, figures seem to be naked, although in some cases the smaller figures
        are depicted with skirts.'

        buttocks and thighs, which have been interpreted as steatopygia (a genetic
        condition resulting in an accumulation of fat in and around the buttocks).
        Although the best documented examples of steatopygia (both in rock art and
        contemporary groups) correspond to southern Africa, steatopygic depictions
        occur elsewhere in North African rock art, with examples in other parts of
        the Ennedi Plateau, but also in Egypt and Sudan, where they occasionally appear
        incised in pottery.

        In addition, almost all the figures are decorated with intricate geometric patterns (straight and wavy lines, squares, meanders and, in one case, schematic birds), which could be interpreted as garments, tattoos, scarifications or body paintings. In some cases, figures appear simply outlined, but these very rare cases were probably left unfinished. The decorative patterns extend to the ears, which are always depicted with geometric designs, and to the head, where these designs could correspond to hairstyles.

        The decorative richness of the Niola Doa engravings has led to their interpretation as ritual scenes, probably special occasions when body decoration was part of a more complex set of activities with dancing or singing. On some occasions, comparisons have been established between the geometric designs of Niola Doa and different types of body decorations (body painting, scarifications). Scarifications, in particular, have a long tradition within some African cultures and in many cases parallels have been documented between this kind of body decoration and material culture (i.e. pottery, pipes, wood sculptures or clothes). The relative proximity of groups with well-known traditions of scarifications and body painting has led to comparisons which, although suggested, cannot be wholly proved.

      body: 'Regarding their chronology, as with most rock art depictions the Niola
        Doa figures are difficult to date, although they undoubtedly belong to the
        older periods of Chadian rock art. Some parallels have been made with the
        Round Head-style figures of the Tassili n’Ajjer (Simonis et al 1994). However,
        the Round Head figures of Algeria have a very old chronology (up to 9000 years
        ago), while the rock art at the Ennedi Plateau is assumed to be much newer,
        up to the 5th or 4th millennium BC. These engravings could, therefore, correspond
        to what has been called the Archaic Period in this area, although a Pastoral
        Period chronology has also been proposed. In several other sites around the
        Ennedi Plateau, similar images have been painted, although whether these images
        are contemporary with those of Niola Doa or correspond to a different period
        is unclear. Regardless of their chronology, what is undeniable is the major
        impact these depictions had on later generations of people living in the area:
        even now, the engravings at one of the sites are known as the ‘Dancing Maidens’,
        while the name of Niola Doa means ‘The place of the girls’ in the local language.'

        the Sahara Desert in the north to the savannah in the south. The country boasts
        thousands of rock engravings and paintings located in two main areas: the
        Ennedi Plateau and the Tibesti Mountains, both to the north. The depictions
        – the oldest of which date back to the fifth millennium BC – represent wild
        animals, cattle and human figures. Paintings of highly detailed riders on
        camels and horses are especially numerous, as are groups of people around
        huts. Chadian rock art is particularly well known for its variety of local
        styles, and it includes some of the richest examples of Saharan rock art.'

      body: 'The north-south orientation of Chad''s elongated shape means it is divided
        into several different climatic zones: the northern part belongs to the Sahara
        Desert, while the central area is included in the Sahel border (the semi-arid
        region south of the Sahara). The southern third of the country is characterized
        by a more fertile savannah. The Ennedi Plateau and Tibesti mountains contain
        thousands of pieces of rock art, including some of the most famous examples
        in the Sahara. The Ennedi Plateau is located at the north-eastern corner of
        Chad, on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. It is a sandstone massif
        carved by erosion in a series of superimposed terraces, alternating plains
        and ragged cliffs crossed by wadis (seasonal rivers). Unlike other areas in
        the Sahara with rock art engravings or paintings, the Ennedi Plateau receives
        rain regularly – if sparsely – during the summer, making it a more benign
        environment for human life than other areas with significant rock art to the
        north, such as the Messak plateau or the Tassili Mountains in Libya and Algeria.'

      body: 'The Tibesti Mountains are situated at the north-western corner of Chad,
        and partly extend into Libya. The central area of the Tibesti Mountains is
        volcanic in origin, with one third of the range covered by five volcanoes.
        This has resulted in vast plateaux as well as fumaroles, sulphur and natron
        deposits and other geological formations. The erosion has shaped large canyons
        where wadis flow irregularly, and where most of the rock art depictions are
        situated. Paintings and engravings are common in both regions: the former
        are more often found in the Ennedi Plateau; the latter are predominant in
        the Tibesti Mountains.'

      title_internal: 'Chad: country, chapter 4'
      body: |-
        Different areas of Chad have been subject to varying trajectories of research. In the Tibesti Mountains, rock art was known to Europeans as early as 1869, although it was between the 1910s and 1930s that the first studies started to be carried out, by François D’Alverny. However, the main boost in research came in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to the work of Paul Huard. Over the last 50 years, researchers have found thousands of depictions throughout the region, most of them engravings, although paintings are also well represented.

        In the case of the Ennedi Plateau, its isolated position far from the main trade routes made its rock art unknown outside the area until the 1930s. During this decade, Burthe d’Annelet brought attention to the art, and De Saint-Floris published the first paper on the subject. The main effort to document this rock art came in 1956-1957, when Gerard Bailloud recorded more than 500 sites in only a sixth of the plateau's entire area.

      title: Themes
      title_internal: 'Chad: country, chapter 5'
      body: As in the rest of the Sahara, the main themes in Chadian rock art are
        directly linked to the chronology. The oldest depictions are of wild animals,
        but most common are later scenes with cattle, huts and people. As in other
        areas of the Sahara, the most recent depictions correspond to battle scenes
        of riders on horses and camels. Along with these main subjects, both areas
        have examples of very detailed scenes of daily life and human activities,
        including people playing music, visiting the sick or dancing. The rock art
        of both the Ennedi Plateau and the Tibesti regions is characterized by the
        existence of a variety of local styles, such as the so-called ‘Flying Gallop
        style’, sometimes simultaneous, sometimes successive. This variability means
        an enormous richness of techniques, themes and artistic conventions, with
        some of the most original styles in Saharan rock art.

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'Chad: country, chapter 6'
      body: |-
        The oldest engravings in Chad are more recent than those to the north, having started to appear in the 5th to 4th millennia BC, and can be broadly divided into three main periods:

        The oldest is the so-called Archaic Period, characterized by wild animals in the Ennedi Plateau and Round Head-style figures in the Tibesti Mountains, similar to those found in the Central Sahara. The second phase is named the Bovine or Pastoral Period, when domestic cattle are the predominant animals, and a third, late period named the Dromedary or Camel Period. Unlike other areas in the Sahara, horse and camel depictions appear to be from roughly the same period (although horses were introduced to the Sahara first), so they are included in a generic Camel Period. The end of the rock art tradition in both areas is difficult to establish, but it seems to have lasted at least until the seventeenth century in the Ennedi Plateau, much longer than in other areas of the Sahara.

      body: A significant concentration of rock art in Mauritania is in the region
        of Guilemsi, an 11-km long ridge, about 70 m high at its highest point. Guilemsi
        is located in the desert, around 50 km north of the town of Tidjika, and about
        200 km west of the renowned Neolithic sites at Dhar Tichitt. Guilemsi’s south
        face contains many ravines with rock shelters, and the rock painting sites
        scattered around the area are to be found in open shelters and ridges or boulders
        on the cliff faces, as well as on the stone banks of a dry river. These sites
        are notable both for the solely painted nature of the rock art, and the variety
        of its subject matter.

      body: There are many stone constructions at Guilemsi that have been known to
        archaeologists for decades, although they have not received the academic attention
        that those further to the East in the Tichitt-Walata region had. The Dhars
        Tagant, Tichitt, Walata and Néma form an enormous crescent-shaped chain of
        sandstone escarpments, enclosing much of southern Mauritania and associated
        with a Neolithic ‘Tichitt Tradition’, which is based on the remains of over
        400 apparent settlements along the escarpment ridges. This culture is thought
        to have existed between about 2,000 BC and 200 BC, based on pastoralism and
        the cultivation of millet, before declining due to the increasing aridity
        of the environment and possible incursion by other cultural groups from the
        North.

        culture to the East is unclear. The ridge at Guilemsi contains many apparent
        funerary monuments consisting of rectangular stone platforms, as well as apparent
        dwelling structures. Some of the funerary monuments appear to be associated

      body: The rock art at Guilemsi appears to be all painted, which marks a contrast
        to Tichitt sites which more often feature engraved rock art. The only non-painted
        rock markings encountered at Guilemsi was several groups of cupules (round,
        man-made depressions in the rock) which were found in three rock shelters.
        Some of the paintings in the area are unusual in themselves- one of the most
        striking is a panel of handprints in red (Fig. 4.), as well as a couple of
        rare paintings appearing to be of big cats, and the heads and finely rendered
        horns of seven antelope, perhaps oryx (Fig. 5.).

        are also depicted here, notably in another singular scene: one of an otherwise
        naturalistic cow with dramatically elongated legs, next to an artificially
        inflated-looking human figure (Fig. 8). Domestic cattle were present in the
        area from at least the second Millennium BC, so these paintings must post-date
        this, although whether they are associated with Tichitt-Tradition pastoralists
        or later groups is not known. The fact that even the more normally-proportioned
        cattle representations at Guilemsi are depicted in a variety of styles (Figs.

        contemporary) painting by peoples with different stylistic traditions.'

      body: 'Two of the most impressive panels of paintings from Guilemsi involve
        not cattle but another important domesticate: ridden horses. There is evidence
        of horses having reached the far West of North Africa by about 600 AD, but
        horses may have been used in the area much earlier, from the mid-1st Millennium
        BC, if not earlier. Although elsewhere in the Sahara the earliest horse images
        appear to show them used for draught purposes rather than riding, in Mauritania,
        almost all depictions of horses in rock art show them being ridden, often
        by apparently armed riders (eg. Fig. 11). At Guilemsi, there are several styles
        of paintings showing horses and riders: the ‘bi-triangular’ and stick-figure
        like styles (Figs. 10 & 11), which have been proposed to be associated with
        early Berber peoples, and another style, showing horses with elongated, stylised
        bodies and short necks (Fig. 9). These horse depictions appear to be of a
        form thus far unrecorded in the rock art of the area, and as such are an interesting
        addition to the known corpus, as Mauritanian rock art has not been as thoroughly
        studied as that of other Saharan countries.'

        of the panel in Fig. 9, but in executed in a very different style. It appears
        to depict a group of armed horsemen, and warriors on foot, vanquishing others
        who are unmounted, who lie, presumably dead, to the left of the horsemen,
        surrounded by spears. This is an unusually dynamic depiction of conflict,
        and it is not known whether it depicts an imagined or real confrontation,
        or, if real, whether it is the work of an artist from the culture of the horsemen
        or those opposing them.

        It has been suggested that the painting of the horse scenes, in line with similar images from other rock art traditions, may be a cathartic spiritual exercise made, possibly by victims of raids, in response to violent intercultural contact. However as with the other images, without an accurate way of scientifically dating such paintings, it is hard to know exactly when they were painted and therefore difficult to propose of or by whom, much less ascribe motivations. Stone tools and the remains of iron smelting activity at Guilemsi suggest successive occupations, possibly over a long period.

        Stylistic links to other sites may be made, however: despite the fact that some of the iconography at Guilemsi appears quite unique, other elements, such as the bichrome cow in Fig. 6, and other square figures at Guilemsi of a man and giraffe, have similar looking counterparts in the Tichitt region, while the “bi-triangular” horses are found elsewhere in the Tagant and Adrar regions of Mauritania, and even as far away as Chad. Understanding of these links is still nascent, as is the interpretation of most Mauritanian rock art, but the variety present at Guilemsi is a valuable addition to the record, and more such sites may remain to be brought to the notice of scholars.

      title: Geography and rock art distribution
      title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 2'
      body: |-
        In total Mauritania covers about 1,030,700 km², most of which forms part of the western portion of the Sahara desert. The southern part of Mauritania incorporates some of the more temperate Sahelian zone, forming part of the geographical and cultural border between Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa. The landscape of the country is generally characterised by its flatness, but the two major neighbouring plateaux in the East-Centre of the country – the Tagant in the South and the Adrar further North – are furnished with rock shelters, boulders and other surfaces upon which can be found abundant rock art, more often engraved than painted.

        The principal concentrations of rock art in Mauritania are located in these two areas, as well as in the North around Bir Moghreïn (in the Mauritanian extension of the Zemmur mountains), the Hank ridge near the borders of Algeria and Mali and the Tichitt-Walata area to the east of the Tagant plateau.

        __Adrar__

        There are about thirty known rock art sites in the Adrar region, although, as with most Mauritanian rock art, study has not been comprehensive and there may be many more as yet undocumented. Engraved rock art sites dominate along the northern edge of the massif, with some of the most significant to be found at the sites of El Beyyed and El Ghallaouiya. Rarer paintings of cattle are also to be found at El Ghallaouiya, as well as at the site of Amogjar.

        __Tagant__

        Less well studied than Adrar, the Tagant plateau contains several painting sites showing horses and riders such as those at the sites of Agneitir Dalma and Tinchmart. The archaeologically significant area of the Tichitt-Walata ridge, a chain of escarpments known for its Neolithic settlements, is largely located within the wider Tagant region to the east of the plateau, and also features many engravings and some paintings.

      title: Research history
      title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 3'
      body: |-
        Recording and research on Mauritanian rock art has been limited in comparison with other Saharan rock art traditions, and has mainly been undertaken by French scholars, as Mauritania was formerly part of French West Africa. The first major publications cataloguing rock art sites in the country were those of Théodore Monod (1937-8), based on recordings collected on expeditions made between 1934 and 1936 and covering the entire western Saharan region. Following this, the explorers Marion Senones and Odette du Puigaudeau published some paintings of the Tagant region in1939. A more comprehensive study of the paintings, engravings and inscriptions of West and North West Africa was made by Raymond Mauny (1954), and emphasised the importance of systematically recording and studying the images in their contexts. More recently (1993), Robert Vernet produced a synthesis of known Mauritanian rock art in his *Préhistoire de la Mauritanie*.

        Many individual Mauritanian rock art sites have also been recorded and published over the decades since the 1940s, particularly in the context of associated archaeological sites, such as those at Tegdaoust and in the Tichitt-Walata region.

      title: Themes
      title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 4'
      body: |-
        The range of subject matter in the rock art of Mauritania is similar to that of other Saharan countries, consisting primarily of images of domestic cattle, along with those of horses both mounted and unmounted, human figures and weaponry, wild fauna, hunting scenes, camels and Libyco-Berber/Tifinagh and Arabic script. Images of goats and sheep are extremely rare.

        Some general geographic tendencies in style and type can be made out, for example, deeply cut and polished naturalistic engravings of large wild animals are concentrated in the North of the country. There is an apparent North-South divide in engraving style, with images becoming more schematic further south. Rarer painting sites are clustered in certain areas such as north of Bir Moghreïn in the far north, and certain Adrar sites, with horse and rider paintings most common in the Tagant and Tichitt-Walata regions.

        Mauritanian rock art consists most commonly of similar-looking scenes of cattle, hunting tableaux, or camel depictions, but there are some exceptions of interest, for example: the monumental bull engraving from Akhrejit in the Dhar Tichitt, which is nearly 5 metres long; the unusually naturalistic paintings of cattle at Amogjar and Tenses in the Adrar; and the curiously shaped painted horses at Guilemsi in the Tagant-Titchitt region.

        In addition, although images of chariots apparently drawn by oxen are known elsewhere in the Sahara, chariots in Saharan rock art are normally associated with horses. In Mauritania, however, there are several images of ox chariots or carts – both painted and engraved – as well as depictions of cattle apparently bearing burdens/saddles, or mounted. Moreover, Mauritania has no known depictions of chariots where the draught animal is identifiably a horse, although there are many images of horses and riders. Sometimes chariots are depicted independent of any animals drawing them, and in all there are over 200 known images of chariots in the country.

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 6'
      body: 'As is the case with all Saharan rock art, sites found in Mauritania are
        very difficult to date, especially absolutely. Monod remarked: ‘it is impossible
        to propose even approximate dates: no landmark pinpoints the end of the Neolithic
        and the arrival of Libyan (Berber) horsemen’ (Monod, 1938, p.128). Relative
        chronologies of rock art styles are easier to identify than specific dates,
        as they may be based on visible elements such as superimpositions in paintings,
        and the darkness level of accrued patina in engravings. In Mauritania, researchers
        have generally paid particular attention to patina as well as themes and styles
        in order to try and place a timeframe on different rock art traditions. Even
        this is an inexact science – however, Monod did propose a three-phase chronology,
        with 1) ‘Ancient’ prehistoric rock art showing large wild fauna and cattle,
        2) ‘Middle’ pre-Islamic art showing horses, camels, riders, arms and armour,
        hunting scenes and Libyco-Berber script and 3) ‘Modern’ Islamic-era art with
        modern Tifinagh and Arabic inscriptions.'

      body: Mauny later proposed a more nuanced chronology, based also on style and
        technique, along the same lines as Monod’s. Mauny’s proposed divisions include
        a ‘naturalist’ period from 5,000–2,000 BC, a cattle pastoralist phase from
        2,500–1,000 BC, a horse period from 1,200 BC onwards, a ‘Libyco-Berber’ group
        from 200 BC–700 AD and a final ‘Arabo-Berber’ phase from 700 AD onwards (Mauny,
        1954). While the oldest rock art, such as the paintings at Amogjar, could
        be more than 5,000 years old, it appears that most Mauritanian rock art probably
        post-dates 2,000 BC, with some, particularly that involving camels, made within
        the last 2,000 years.

        is some evidence for a combination of hunting and pastoral activity in the

        means of subsistence in the South after 2,000 BC.'

      body: The first solid archaeological evidence for horses this far west is from
        about 600 AD. However, horses and chariots could have been introduced over
        a thousand years before, possibly by early Berber peoples from the North,
        who are thought to have made increased incursions from the 4th Millennium
        onwards, and with whom much of the rock art is usually associated. Chariot
        images can be reasonably assumed to date from the time we know chariots were
        in use in the Sahara – i.e. not earlier than 1,200 BC.

      title_internal: 'Mauritania: country, chapter 10'
      body: 'Generally, the study of Mauritanian rock art traditions has focused more
        on cataloguing the images and categorising them by style, technique and perceived
        age than investigating their potential cultural significance. The limitations
        in the ability to scientifically date these images, and the fact that they
        are not usually associated with other archaeological materials, hinders effective
        attempts at interpretation or ascribing authorship, beyond basic ‘Neolithic’
        ‘pastoralist’, or ‘early Berber’. Even this may not be clear-cut or mutually
        exclusive: for example, incoming Berber peoples in the Adrar Plateau after
        2,000 BC are thought to have been cattle pastoralists, as their non-Berber
        predecessors probably were. In addition, while the desertification process
        was definitive from this time on, fluctuations and regional microclimates
        made pastoralism viable relatively recently in some areas – in the Adrar there
        is still evidence of cattle rearing as late as 1,000 BC or after, and some
        areas of the Tagant region may have been able to support cattle as late as
        the 18th century. Thus subject matter alone is not necessarily indicative
        of date or authorship: depictions of cattle may be Berber or non-Berber, as
        old as the 4th millennium BC or as recent as the 1st, if not later.'

      body: It is possible to make some more specific inferences based on style. Some
        of the more naturalistic cattle paintings from the Adrar have been compared
        in style to the Bovidian style paintings of the Tassili n’Ajjer in Libya,
        and some of the more geometric designs to others in Senegal and Mali. Links
        have also been suggested between some cattle and symbolic images and modern
        Fulani and Tuareg traditions and iconography. In terms of significance, changes
        to rock art style over time, from naturalistic to schematic, have been remarked
        upon as perhaps somehow reflecting environmental changes from savannah to
        steppe and desert. It has also been debated whether some of the geometric
        symbols and images of riders on horseback were the result of conflict, perhaps
        made by the victims of Berber invasions as catharsis or to ward off evil.

        region is desirable, as it potentially holds much interest for the study of
        the history and prehistory of Mauritania. It is also an endangered resource,
        due to a combination of environmental factors, such as extremes of temperature
        which damage and split the rocks, and human interference from looting and
        vandalism.

      title: Game Pass Shelter, South Africa
      title_internal: 'South Africa: featured site, chapter 1'
      body: "Game Pass shelter is one of the most well-known rock art sites in South
        Africa. Situated in the foothills of the Drakensberg mountains, a sandstone
        recess atop a steep slope contains rock paintings made by people from the
        San|Bushman¹ communities who historically lived as hunter-gatherers throughout
        southern Africa. The Drakensberg mountains in particular are known for their
        wealth of rock paintings, often showing detailed and brightly coloured images
        of people, animals and part-human, part-animal figures known as ‘therianthropes’,
        with this site a prime example. One of the panels of paintings here is particularly
        important in the history of rock art research, as in the 1970s it helped to
        inspire a new kind of approach to the understanding of the meanings and symbolism
        of San|Bushman paintings and engravings.\n\n"

      body: The most prominent painting panel at Game Pass shows a series of carefully
        depicted eland antelope in delicately shaded red, brown and white pigment,
        largely super-imposing a group of ambiguous anthropomorphic figures wrapped
        in what appear to be bell-shaped karosses (traditional skin cloaks). Several
        small human figures appear to be running above them. These are some of the
        best-preserved rock paintings in the Drakensberg, with the largest animals
        around 30 cm long.  To the left of this panel are two smaller sets of images,
        one with two further eland, some further human-like figures and a human figure
        with a bow; the other (Fig. 1 below) a small panel, for which the site is
        most renowned.   An image around 50 cm long  shows an eland with its face
        turned towards the viewer, depicted as if stumbling forwards, with its hind
        legs crossed.  Grasping the eland's tail is a therianthrope figure with hooves
        for feet. Like the eland, this figure has its legs crossed and is depicted
        with small lines like raised hairs bristling from its body. To the right are
        three further therianthrope figures.

        in a 1915 issue of Scientific American, and it has been frequently published
        on and discussed through the 20th century.  While studying a reproduction
        of the image with the stumbling eland in the early 1970s, researcher David
        Lewis-Williams began to consider that the figure holding the eland's tail
        (Fig. 2 below) might not be a simple illustration of a man wearing a skin
        suit, or performing an act of bravura, as had been suggested by previous researchers,
        but might be “idiomatic and metaphorical, rather than illustrative” (Lewis-Williams
        1981:91).

      body: "This idea was partly inspired by the testimony of Qing, a San|Bushman
        man who, in 1873, had guided the Colonial Administrator Joseph Millerd Orpen
        to rock art sites in the mountains of Lesotho, with which the Drakensberg
        forms a natural eastern border with South Africa and which also contains many
        rock paintings. Qing's explanations of the paintings, some of which Orpen
        copied, included a reference to antelope-headed human figures having “died
        and gone to live in rivers, who were spoilt at the same time as the elands
        and… by the dances of which you have seen paintings”. This, along with testimony
        and practices recorded from other South African San|Bushman people at the
        time, as well as those living elsewhere in south-western Africa in the 20th
        century, suggested to Lewis-Williams that these and other images in San|Bushman
        rock art may be a reference to the activities of spiritual leaders or 'shamans',
        people who, in San|Bushman communities, are believed to have the power to
        interact with spirits and the spirit world in ways which may affect the physical
        world. \n\nLewis-Williams and other proponents of this 'shamanistic' approach
        to interpreting San|Bushman rock art have proposed that much of its imagery
        is in fact related to the shaman's experience during the 'trance dance' ritual
        found in all San|Bushman socie-ties. During this activity the shaman enters
        a hallucinatory state in which spiritual ‘tasks’ such as healing the sick
        may be undertaken on behalf of the community. On entering the trance state
        the shaman experiences trembling, sweating, stumbling and other symptoms similar
        to those of a dying antelope hit by a poisoned arrow. Lewis Williams noted
        that among some San|Bushman people this process is referred to as ‘dying’
        or being ‘spoilt’ and considered that the similarities between the eland and
        the therianthrope figure in this image represent this conceived equivalence.\n\n"

        Despite the historical presence of other large game animals in the Drakensberg, the eland is the most commonly depicted animal in rock art of the region. Patricia Vinnicombe, noting this and the focus on other particular subjects in the imagery at the expense of others, proposed in her pioneering 1976 study of the rock art of the Southern Drakensberg *People of the Eland* that the paintings are “not a realistic reflection of the daily pursuits or environment of the Bushmen” (Vinnicombe 1976:347). Vinnicombe recalled that when, in the 1930s, an old Sotho man named Mapote, who had San|Bushman half-siblings and had used to paint with them, was requested to demonstrate, he had said that since the San|Bushmen had been “of the eland”, he should first depict an eland. Based on this and recountings of a myth about the creation and death of the first eland from Qing and other contemporary Southern San|Bushman people, Vinnicombe concluded that the eland, although regularly hunted by the Drakensberg San|Bushmen, had been a particularly sacred or powerful animal to them and that “Through the act of painting and re-painting the eland… the mental conflict involved in destroying a creature that was prized and loved by their deity…was…ritually symbolised and resolved” (Vinnicombe, 1976:350).

        Building on the idea of the spiritual significance of the eland, the approach proposed by Lewis-Williams offered an alternative interpretation by inferring from ethnography that eland were believed to have spiritual ‘potency’. As part of a complex system of beliefs involving conceptions of power and potency in relation to animals and rites, this potency could be released upon death, with trancing shamans believed to be able to harness it, feeling themselves taking on the attributes of the animal. Thus therianthrope figures like those depicted here may be interpreted as representing hallucinatory experiences of shamans in trance, where they may feel that they are assuming the forms of other animals. It has been argued that other motifs such as geometric forms known as 'entoptics' represent the abstract patterns created by neural networks and ‘seen’ during the early stages of entering an altered state of consciousness and that the paintings themselves may have been created as reservoirs of spiritual potency.

      body: |
        The rock art of South Africa has probably been studied more extensively than that of any other African country.  It is estimated that South Africa contains many thousands of rock art sites, with a great variety of styles and techniques.  The most well-known rock art in South Africa is that created by the San|Bushman¹ people (several culturally linked groups of indigenous people of southern Africa who were traditionally hunter-gatherers) and their ancestors, with the painted rock shelters of the Drakensberg mountains some of the most well-known rock art sites in the world.  However, the range of South African rock art is wide, spanning great distances, many centuries, and different cultural traditions.

        ¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

      title: Geography and rock art distribution
      title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 2'
      body: South Africa covers around 1,213,090 km², encircling Lesotho and bordered
        in the north by Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe and in the west by Mozambique
        and Swaziland.  Much of the interior of the country consists of a high central
        plateau bordered by the Great Escarpment, a rocky ridge which forms the bulk
        of the long Drakensberg mountain system in the east and several smaller ranges
        in the centre and west of the country, as well as the western border with
        Lesotho.  Further to the south, the Cape Fold Mountains mirror the bend of
        the cape coast.  Much of South Africa’s known engraved rock art is found on
        igneous or metamorphic formations in the semi-arid environments of the central
        plateau.  In contrast, painted rock art sites are more commonly located in
        the sandstone and quartzite rock shelters of the mountain systems, which form
        the edges of the more temperate, low-lying coastal regions in the east and
        south of the country.

      title: Hunter-gatherer rock art
      title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 3'
      body: Much of both the painted and engraved rock art of South Africa is characterised
        by its naturalistic depictions of animals, as well as numerous images of people,
        ambiguous figures with mixtures of animal and human features, and certain
        ‘geometric’ or abstract shapes and patterns.  These images are the work of
        San|Bushman people and their ancestors.  Although San|Bushman communities
        now live mainly in Namibia, Botswana and north-western South Africa, historically
        San|Bushman cultural groups lived more widely throughout southern Africa.  Hunter-gatherer
        people are thought to have been the only inhabitants of what is now South
        Africa until the arrival of herding and farming people from the north from
        around 2,000 years ago.

      title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 4'
      body: "Some paintings and engravings in South Africa were made by Bantu language-speaking
        farming people.  These include a distinct tradition of rock shelter paintings
        found in the north-west of the country, featuring mostly white finger-painted
        images of animals such as crocodiles and giraffes and other motifs.  These
        paintings, located in remote areas, are known to have been created by Northern
        Sotho people. Further to the south and west, engraved designs showing conjoined
        circle motifs are found throughout KwaZulu Natal and some areas of Mpumalanga
        and Gauteng Provinces, and appear to have been made by the ancestors of Sotho-Tswana
        and Nguni language speakers, perhaps ancestors of modern Zulu people.\n\n"

      title: Herder rock art and other traditions
      title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 5'
      body: Some rock art styles and motifs elsewhere in South Africa seem to belong
        to other unique traditions.  It has been proposed that engraved rock art patterns
        with particular features including circular, linear and oblong motifs found
        at sites across the country, particularly near watercourses, may be the work
        of the Khoekhoen people or their ancestors, herders culturally related to
        the San|Bushmen. Some paintings also appear to reflect this tradition. Local
        rock art traditions specific to certain areas include, among others, conglomerations
        of handprints near the coast in the south-western part of the Western Cape
        and rows of engraved cupules in the north east of the country. There are also
        several examples from different rock art traditions across South Africa, of
        depictions of European people, items or events (such as horses and firearms)
        which clearly date from the 17th century or later.  In the Karoo region, rock
        gongs (natural rock formations with indentations indicating that they have
        been used as percussive instruments) are sometimes associated with engraving
        sites.

        within them. The presence of rock art in the Cape region has been known to
        Europeans since at least the mid- 18th century AD, with one of the first known
        reports from the expedition of  Ensign A. F. Beutler in 1752, describing paintings
        near the Great Fish River in the Eastern Cape.  Further written references
        to rock art from the area were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries,
        with some of the earliest known reproductions of Southern African rock art
        made in the 1770s. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, painted copies
        were made of San|Bushman rock art by amateur artists such as George Stow,
        Mark and Graham Hutchinson and Helen Tongue. '

        20th century and pioneering efforts were made to record both painting and
        engraving assemblages. In 1928 renowned archaeologist and ethnologist Leo
        Frobenius mounted an expedition to record sites in South Africa as well as
        Zimbabwe and Namibia, while in the interior regions over the previous twenty
        years, Maria Wilman had instigated the first systematic rock engraving recording
        work. This endeavor was built upon from the late 1950s onwards with the extensive
        work of Gerhard and Dora Fock.  In the same decade Alex Willcox pioneered
        the practice of recording rock art through colour photography, and over the
        next twenty years, further recording and analysis projects were undertaken

      body: In 1976, Vinnicombe published the seminal work *"People of the Eland"*,
        analysing paintings from 150 Drakensberg sites and attempting to gain insight
        into their execution and significance through a combination of quantitative
        study and reference to San|Bushman ethnography (written records of insights
        from San|Bushman culture compiled by anthropologists).  Through the 1980s,
        interpretation of rock art was further developed, perhaps most significantly
        by David Lewis-Williams, a collaborator of Vinnicombe's. Lewis-Williams originated
        an approach to understanding San|Bushman rock art which posits that the motivation
        and meaning for most, if not all, San|Bushman rock art is based on the centrality
        of the spiritual leader or'shaman' and the shaman’s actions in San|Bushman
        life and belief.  Over the past 30 years, the idea that much of San|Bushman
        rock art is essentially ‘shamanistic’ in nature has been dominant in academic
        discourse.

      title: Themes and interpretations
      title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 9'
      body: "Shamanistic interpretations of San|Bushman paintings and engravings draw
        on both past records of ‘Southern’ or /Xam San|Bushman people living historically
        in South Africa and more recent ethnography based mainly on San|Bushman communities
        in Namibia and Botswana, suggesting that their imagery illustrated and reinforced
        the power of the actions of shamans. Much of the imagery is proposed to reflect
        the shaman’s hallucinatory visions from the 'trance dance’, a tradition common
        to San|Bushman groups where shamans enter a trance state during which they
        visit a 'spirit world' in which they may go on spiritual journeys or perform
        tasks on behalf of their communities. It is thought that the rock art panels
        may have acted as reservoirs for the 'potency' that shamans are considered
        to possess, with the rock face considered a veil between both worlds.  The
        images are thought to reflect trance experiences including those of 'therianthropes’,
        images of figures with both human and animal features, explained as shamans
        who in a trance state feel themselves transformed into animals.  Certain other
        poses and features found in San|Bushman rock art, such as so-called 'entoptic'
        motifs—geometric shapes such as zigzags and dots—have also been interpreted
        as reflecting visions that shamans experience while in a trance state.  \n\nDiscussion
        continues around the extent of the applicability of 'shamanist' interpretations
        for all aspects of San|Bushman art, with research ongoing and scholars also
        exploring the potential roles of other elements in rock art production, such
        as mythology or gender and initiation rites.  Other avenues of study include
        more regional foci, on specific cultural and temporal contexts and how the
        imagery may reflect local power dynamics through time.\n"

      body: 'Although the focus in South African rock art research has been on San|Bushman
        art, research has also been done on other rock art traditions, suggesting
        different cultural origins.  For example, investigation of Northern Sotho
        rock art has shown much of it to have been created in relation to boys''and
        girls'' initiation ceremonies, while Bantu-language speakers''engravings of
        interlinked circle patterns have been interpreted as images of idealised conceptualised
        homesteads.  Work on attribution for some rock art of uncertain authorship
        also has been undertaken.  Certain geometric forms of rock engraving may be
        of Khoekhoen origin, possibly showing influence from central African geometric
        traditions and tracing historical migrations southwards.  It has also been
        suggested that some finger-painted images in the centre of the country are
        the early 19th century work of the Korana people, a group of mixed ancestry
        living as raiders on the Cape frontier and incorporating motifs from San|Bushman
        and other traditions. '

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 11'
      body: "The earliest scientifically dated examples of clearly visible painted
        parietal art in South Africa comes from Steenbokfontein Cave in the Western
        Cape, where collapsed painted portions from the wall buried in sediment have
        been radiocarbon dated to at least 3,600 years ago, while in the Drakensberg,
        AMS dating carried out on the oxalate crust superimposing a painting of a
        human figure has suggested it to be at least 1,800 years old.  While it is
        thought that the beginnings of the painting tradition in the Drakensberg region
        are probably older than this, the relative lack of durability in paint means
        that many of the existing paintings were probably made sometime within the
        past few hundred years. Sometimes it is apparent when this is the case - several
        painting sites in this region show images of both San|Bushman people and Europeans
        riding horses and bearing firearms, which dates them to within the past 350
        years and particularly the 19th century.  Images of sheep and cattle also
        place images within the last 2,000 years.  \n\nThe oldest reliably dated evidence
        for deliberate engraving in the country is several ochre pieces incised with
        abstract patterns found in a buried layer in Blombos cave in the Western Cape
        and dated through a number of methods to between 70 and 100,000 years ago.
        \ The earliest known figurative engraving date from the country comes from
        a slab with an image of a portion of an animal on it, excavated from Wonderwerk
        Cave in the Northern Cape and dating from around 10,200 years ago.  Engravings
        remaining in the open are more difficult to date scientifically, and various
        attempts have been made to date and sequence both engravings and paintings
        based on style and superimposition, while recent years, work has been undertaken
        to apply the Harris Matrix (an archaeological sequencing technique for relative
        dating) method to painting chronologies in the Free State, Drakensberg and
        Western Cape.  This involves using techniques originally conceived for charting
        chronology in stratigraphic layering to compare and sequence different superimposed
        motifs.\n"

        by granite hills separated by nearly parallel valleys where the vegetation
        consists of scattered woodlands and areas covered by grass with an abundance
        of wild fruits. The region was occupied since at least the Middle Stone Age,
        but the human presence increased in the last millennia BC. The region holds
        an incredible amount of rock art; as many as 3,000 sites have been estimated
        based on the better surveyed areas. Paintings constitute the vast majority
        of depictions, although occasional engravings have also been reported. Paintings
        are usually found in rock shelters and associated with archaeological remains,
        which show an occupation of the area since the Early Stone Age. '

        rare. They are usually depicted in a slender style, facing left or right but
        with the upper part of the body facing front, and often carrying bows, arrows
        or other objects. Regarding the animals, mammals dominate, with the kudu antelope
        being especially numerous although this animal is not commonly found in the

        zebras, ostriches, monkeys, eland antelope, rhinoceros and to a lesser extent
        carnivores are also depicted. The animals are represented in very different
        attitudes and may be depicted standing still, running or lying. Humans and
        animals are often related in hunting scenes. Along with animals and human
        figures, a fair number of geometric symbols are present, including a very

        in a different colour. '

      body: "Many of the depictions in the Matobo Hills are associated with hunter-gatherers,
        providing a great amount of information about the social, economic and spiritual
        life of these groups. Depictions of daily objects (bows, vessels, digging
        sticks, cloaks) appear depicted in the rock art, and humans are shown hunting
        animals, fighting other groups and dancing in what seem to be ritual scenes.
        In fact, many of the scenes show strong similarities to those found in the
        Drakensberg (South Africa), and part of the iconography in the Zimbabwean
        paintings – ‘therianthropes’ (part-human, part-animal figures), elongated
        figures, rain animals, geometric figures – can be easily related to trance
        or rain-making activities similar to those seen in South Africa. These paintings
        have been interpreted as representing the trance experiences of shamans (the
        term ‘shaman’ is derived from Siberian concepts of Shamanism and its applicability
        to San|Bushman¹ cultures has been questioned, but it is utilised here on the
        understanding that it sufficiently represents trancers in this academic context,
        where it is the most frequently used term to describe them). However, unlike
        in South Africa, the Matobo Hills rock art is not recent and researchers lack
        the key ethnographic records that help us to interpret the paintings. Therefore,
        interpretations cannot be directly extrapolated from the South African paintings
        to those of the Matobo Hills, and researchers such as Peter Garlake have broadened
        the interpretative framework of this art to include social issues in addition
        to the religious. \n\n"

        rock art does not show evidence of interaction between these two groups, and
        it is probable that the hunter-gatherers that inhabited the area were either
        displaced or absorbed by these new farmer communities. However, some of the
        later paintings show some links with the previous hunter-gatherers traditions.
        This later art consists mainly of schematic figures (usually animals, including
        domestic ones such as goats and cows) and geometric symbols, mostly depicted

      title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 1'
      body: 'Zimbabwe is a landlocked country surrounded by Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana
        and South Africa, occupying a large, granitic high plateau between the Zambezi
        and Limpopo river systems, with a tropical climate moderated by altitude.
        The highest part of the country is the eastern Highlands; a north-south mountain
        range reaching altitudes of 2,500 m. Rock art is located in two main areas,
        the northern region of Mashonaland and the south-western area of Matabeleland.
        These areas are full of granite hills and boulders that provide excellent
        shelters for the paintings. The Matobo hills in Matabeleland constitute one
        of the most outstanding examples of rock art in Southern Africa. The total
        number of Zimbabwean rock art sites is unknown, but estimations made point
        to thousands of sites throughout the country, with more being discovered annually. '

      title: History of the research
      title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 2'
      body: 'Zimbabwean rock art was first reported by Europeans in 1927, when Miles
        Burkitt visited southern Africa, but is especially linked to Leo Frobenius,
        one of the most renowned researchers in the first decades of the 20th century.
        Leo Frobenius travelled to the region in 1928 with a German team and thoroughly
        documented numerous paintings, identifying many of the most characteristic
        features of Zimbabwean rock art. However, he failed in identifying the authors
        of the paintings, ascribing them to external influences of “high civilizations”
        instead to the local communities who made them. Subsequently, work was continued
        by Elizabeth Mannsfeld-Goodall, who for forty years documented rock art paintings
        constituting a huge corpus of tracings, but without developing an interpretative
        framework for them. In the 1950s, another historic researcher, the Abbé Henri
        Breuil, visited Zimbabwe and studied the paintings, again suggesting an Egyptian
        or Minoan origin. It wasn’t until the 1960s and 1970s when a more objective
        approach to the study of rock art started, with Peter Garlake the most prominent
        figure in research from the 1980s onwards. Garlake wrote the first comprehensive
        books on Zimbabwean rock art (Garlake 1987), integrating it within the general
        framework of southern Africa and raising awareness about the importance of
        these archaeological expressions. In 2003 the Matobo Hills were included in
        the World Heritage List acknowledging the relevance of Zimbabwean rock art
        for African heritage. '

      title: Themes
      title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 3'
      body: The rock art of Zimbabwe is some of the richest in Africa both in variety
        and complexity, the vast majority being painted figures infilled or outlined
        usually with just one colour, although bichrome examples are also known. The
        human figure is the most often represented engaged in different activities
        -hunting, walking, dancing- either isolated or in groups of up to forty people.
        The figures are depicted in different styles, from the very schematic to relatively
        naturalistic outlines, with men far more represented than women, and usually
        depicted carrying bows and arrows. In some cases, these figures are part of
        very complex scenes including animals and geometric symbols, some of which
        have been interpreted as trance-like scenes similar to those in South Africa
        with figures bleeding from their noses, crouching or dancing in groups or
        sharing animal traits. A very specific type of depiction is human figures
        with hugely distended abdomens, a trait that is associated either with fertility
        or mystic potency concepts.

      body: 'Along with human figures, animals are widely represented in Zimbabwean
        rock art, with kudu depictions dominating, but also with zebra, tsessebe and
        sable antelopes commonly represented. Surprisingly, other antelopes such as
        eland, waterbucks or wildebeest are very rarely represented, while other animals
        (lions, cheetah, birds, ant bears, porcupines, baboons or warthogs) are very
        scarce. Fish and crocodiles are relatively common, the latter represented
        as if seen from above or below. There seems to be a preference for the depiction
        of females rather than males, especially in the case of antelopes or elephants.
        Regardless of the type of animal, the depictions seem to have a deep symbolism
        far beyond the representation of animals just hunted and consumed, often being
        surrounded by dots, flecks or networks of lines. That symbolism is especially
        important in the case of the elephant, which is often depicted being hunted
        by groups of men. '

        Traditionally, the themes expressed in Zimbabwean rock art have been identified as the same as those of the San|Bushmen¹ from South Africa and in many cases are undoubtedly related, and provide key hints for their interpretation. However, there are also differences, such as the emphasis given to different animals, the higher presence of trees and plants in Zimbabwe or the smaller presence of trance scenes in the north compared to that of the Drakensberg. Moreover, the lack of ethnographic information for Zimbabwean paintings and their older chronology make it difficult to establish the same type of associations as those made for other areas with more direct connections rock art to known cultures, as happens in South Africa. Although in a minority, rock art of a later chronology can be attributed to Iron Age farmers, characterized by more schematic figures, usually white and painted thickly with the finger or the hand. As is the case in other areas in Central Africa, some of these later depictions are related to rain making and initiation ceremonies.

        ¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 6'
      body: "As with much rock art, the dating of Zimbabwe paintings is a challenging
        subject, although there is a consensus about them being significantly older
        than those of the Drakensberg and probably dated at before 2,000 years ago.
        The lack of any type of agriculture-related images in the paintings, which
        was established by the 1st millennium AD, sets a relative dating for the depictions,
        while the scarcity of sheep (introduced by the second half of the first millennium
        BC in the area) points to a time period in which these animals were still
        uncommon. These hints and the fact that, unlike in other areas there are not
        historical subjects represented in the paintings, seems to indicate that Zimbabwean
        paintings are at least 1,000 years old. However, archaeological evidence (Walker
        2012: 44) suggests that rock art could be significantly older than that, at
        least several thousands of years old. \n\n"

        the north-west of central Namibia, forms the largest single grouping of ancient
        engraved images in southern Africa.  Covering about 57 hectares in the core
        area and home to over 2,000 engravings, the rock art sites are situated near
        a small but permanent spring. The site was first formally noted by Reinhard
        Maack in a 1921 report to the Administrator of South West Africa, following
        a report to him from a surveyor named Volkmann mentioning the engravings,
        near a spring Volkmann named as Uais (/Ui-//aes= place among rocks or jumping
        waterhole in Khoekhoegowab, the language of the local Damara people).  Later,
        the land came into the use of farmer David Levin, whose concern over the survival
        of the spring led ultimately to its being referred to as Twyfelfontein (‘doubtful
        spring’ in Afrikaans). In 1963 Ernst Scherz visited the site as part of his
        work to record rock art sites throughout South West Africa.  Scherz documented
        around 2,500 images in the wider valley area, while a 2005 survey of the core
        site found 2,075 individual images on 235 separate rock surfaces.  '

      body: The engravings are found in several loose conglomerations, on sandstone
        surfaces at the base of a hill scarp within the basin of the ephemeral Huab
        River, while the few painted panels in the area are found on the underside
        of sandstone rock overhangs.  The engraved images are pecked and/or ground/polished
        and are made in a variety of styles, with ubiquitous geometric patterns of
        cross-hatched, looped and linear forms, as well as circles and polished depressions
        and cupules.  In addition there are numerous depictions of animals, ranging
        in style from more naturalistic to stylised and distorted.  Chief among the
        animal images is the giraffe, which is most numerous.  Also common are images
        of rhinoceroses, zebra, gemsbok antelope and ostriches.  There are occasional
        depictions of cattle but images of human beings are almost absent.  Also featured
        are images of human footprints and animal spoor (hoof and paw prints).

      body: The figurative images in the engraved art feature several different distinct
        styles, ranging from very naturalistic outlines of animals such as giraffes
        and rhinoceroses, through carefully delineated but stylised or distorted renditions
        of these animals with exaggerated extremities, to very schematic pecked outlines.  One
        particular aspect of style is a form of relief engraving, whereby in some
        deeply pecked figures' muscle masses are delineated.  In others, the infill
        pecking is graded and  sparser in the centre of a figure, giving the impression
        of shading.  A few of the engravings are highly polished.  Perhaps most renowned
        among these is the “dancing kudu” image, a stylised image of a kudu antelope
        cow rendered atop a flat slab of rock and surrounded by geometric shapes.

      body: "It appears that the kudu figure is pregnant and it has been suggested
        that the choice of this animal may have been made in relation to female initiation
        practices. This is because the female kudu has a symbolic importance relating
        to women’s behaviour in the cosmology of some San|Bushman¹ people, traditionally
        hunter-gatherer people whose ancestors are thought to have made most of southern
        Africa’s rock paintings and engravings.  Other animals known to have symbolic
        and metaphorical significance to San|Bushman people are also depicted here
        (giraffe images are most numerous) and these images have been interpreted
        in the vein of other southern African rock art sites, where images are thought
        to reflect the experiences of shamans while in a trance state, and may have
        multiple metaphorical and other cultural meanings.  \n\nThe engravings were
        certainly made in strategic locations and not simply on any available rock
        surface, with some images having been deliberately made in places that are
        difficult to reach and to see.  The reason for this is unclear, though it
        has been suggested that such placement might be in relation to the images
        serving a preparatory function for shamans preparing to enter a trance.  Some
        of the engravings have exaggerated features such as elongated limbs and extremities
        which may reflect trance experience.  One of the engravings appears to depict
        a lion with pugmarks (paw prints) instead of feet and third at the end of
        the tail.  Each of those in the feet have five instead of the correct four
        pads and this has been interpreted as meaning that the figure represents a
        human shaman in trance who has taken on lion form.  A similar suggestion has
        been made regarding the frequent depictions of ostriches (Kinahan, 2006).
        \ \n\n¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different
        hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages
        and cultural traditions. Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive
        terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted
        them.\n"

      body: "Such interpretations are made on the basis that the artists followed
        the same cultural tradition as the ancestral San|Bushman. The few examples
        of painted rock art at the site certainly appear to conform to the hunter-gatherer
        tradition found elsewhere in Namibia.   Following this approach, the geometric
        engraved forms may be interpreted as illustrative of so-called ‘entoptic’
        phenomena: shapes and patterns observed when entering a trance state, though
        an alternative origin for some of the geometrics with particular line and
        circle motifs has also been suggested. This proposal suggests that they were
        made by ancestral Khoenkhoen herder people, rather than hunter-gatherers,
        perhaps in relation to initiation practices.  \n\nAttempting to date or sequence
        the images based on superimpositioning or patina is difficult – superimposition
        of engravings at the site is rare and a range of patination colours seem to
        indicate these works having been created over a wide timescale, though it
        has been noted that a certain style of spoor images sometimes overlie some
        of the animal figures, indicating that this is a younger tradition.  Archaeological
        fieldwork around the site undertaken in 1968 by Erich Wendt recovered evidence
        of occupation including stone tools, worked ostrich eggshell and stone structures.
        \ The dates recovered from radiocarbon dating ranged widely from c.5,850-180
        BP (years before present).  The relationship between periods of occupation/site
        use and the production of rock art is not known, but based on archaeological
        evidence from around the wider area it is thought that engravings in the styles
        found at Twyfelfontein range from around 6,000 to around 1,000 years old,
        though some may be more recent.\n"

        to the northern border, although rock art sites are scarce in the far north.
        \ The majority of known rock art sites are found in the rocky and mountainous
        areas forming the escarpment edge in the west of the country.  Particular
        concentrations of rock art are found in the west-centre of the country, north
        of the edge of the Namib’s coastal sand sea.  Namibia’s most well-known rock
        art locales are clustered in this area, among them the Brandberg (also known
        as Dâures) and Erongo mountains and the Spitzkoppe peaks, as well as the well-known
        engraved rock art complex at  Twyfelfontein | /Ui-//aes.  \n\nAround  20km
        wide, the almost circular granitic intrusion of the Brandberg contains Namibia’s
        highest point  at over 2,500 ft., and around 1,000 rock art sites, with around
        50,000 individual figures recorded. These include both paintings and engravings
        but paintings form the majority. The Erongo mountains, a similar but less
        compact formation around 120km to the south-east, contain a further 80 sites
        and 50km to the west of this, the Spitzkoppe peaks, a group of granite inselbergs,
        has a smaller concentration of known sites with 37 so far recorded.  Painting
        sites are most often found on vertical surfaces in rock shelters or the sides
        of granitic boulders,  while engravings may survive in more exposed environments
        such as on boulders, often dolerite or sandstone.   \n\nThe most well-known
        of the engraving sites is that of Twyfelfontein | /Ui-//aes, around 50 km
        north of the Brandberg. The rock art complex here is dominated by collections
        of engraved images, though some paintings are also present.  With well over
        2,000 individual images, the Twyfelfontein engravings form the largest known
        discrete collection of engraved rock art in Southern Africa.   \n"

      body: 'The first published mention of rock art in south-western Africa may be
        that of C. J. Andersson who mentioned “A strange tale of a rock in which the
        tracks of …animals are distinctly visible” in his 1856 book Lake Ngami.  Further
        reports came in the 1870s when the Reverend C. J. Büttner published an article
        in a South African periodical reporting rock art in the Erongo Mountains,
        while Commissioner William Coates Palgrave made a report of paintings near
        Dassiesfontein, along with some the earliest known photographs of rock art
        in Africa.  European public awareness of rock art from the region in Europe
        was spurred by the January 1910 publication of an article  by Oberleutnant
        Hugo Jochmann featuring images from various sites in a German magazine.  The  first
        monograph on the rock art of the area then known as South West Africa was
        published in 1930 (Obermaier & Kühn, 1930), following further reports by officials,
        including the explorer and geographer Reinhardt Maack, who in a 1921 report
        first noted the existence of engravings at Twyfelfontein.  '

      body: "During the course of an earlier expedition, Maack had stumbled upon a
        singular painting in a Brandberg rock shelter. This image came to be well-known
        as the ‘White Lady’ of the Brandberg, after the renowned rock art researcher
        the Abbé Henri Breuil, who saw Maack’s copy of it and took a keen interest
        in the image. Eventually Breuil published a lavishly illustrated volume on
        the White Lady in 1955, which made it one of the most famous rock painting
        images in the world.  During the 1940s and 50s Breuil also explored and published
        on rock art sites elsewhere in the Brandberg and Erongo mountains.  \n\nErnst
        Scherz, who had acted as a guide for Breuil, would go on to conduct extensive
        documentation work throughout the country as part of  the comprehensive research
        project investigating the archaeology of South West Africa run by the University
        of Cologne and sponsored by the Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft.  Beginning
        in 1963, this resulted in the publications of Scherz’s three-volume opus *Felsbilder
        in Sudwest-Afrika* in 1970, 1975 and 1986, containing site by site descriptions
        and classifications of painting and engraving sites throughout modern Namibia,
        along with discussion of theme and context.  The Cologne programme also supported
        the work of several other researchers, including the designer and artist Harald
        Pager, whose meticulous work recording rock paintings in South Africa’s Drakensberg
        had already gained him recognition in the field of rock art research. From
        1977, Pager began a seven year project of recording painted rock art sites
        in the Brandberg, documenting around 43,000 individual images.  Pager’s corpus
        has been organised by Tilman Lenssen-Erz and published posthumously in the
        six-volume   *Rock Paintings of the Upper Brandberg*, as a result of which
        the Brandberg is one of the most comprehensively documented rock art regions
        on earth.\n"

      title: Themes
      title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 8'
      body: "Much of the painted rock art in Namibia may be broadly compared to the
        wider hunter-gatherer rock art oeuvre found throughout southern Africa, similar
        in theme and composition and believed to be a part of the same general tradition,
        which is generally attributed to San|Bushman¹ people and their ancestors.
        \ Imagery includes scenes of human figures carrying bows and other implements,
        wild animals and unidentified shapes in different pigments.  Overall, human
        figures dominate in the paintings of Namibia, making up more than 2/3 of the
        painted figures, and where the gender can be recognised, they are more commonly
        male than female.  Prominent painting subjects and styles in the rock art
        of Namibia (particularly the best-studied west-central region) include, at
        some sites, clearly delineated dots and patterns on human figures, a particular
        tradition of showing human figures with voluminous decorated hairstyles, and
        more images of giraffe and kudu, gemsbok and springbok antelope than in other
        southern African regions.  Other images of animals include those of zebras,
        elephants, rhinoceros and ostriches.  More occasional motifs found include
        plants, cattle, sheep and handprints. \n\n¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term
        used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in
        southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions. Both 'San'
        and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups,
        although others have positively adopted them."

        are much more schematic in style and appear to belong to a different tradition
        altogether.  \n\nAs with much southern African rock art, the colours visible
        today may not always accurately reflect the original look as some pigments.
        \ This is particularly true for those used for pale colours or white, which
        may be ‘fugitive’, meaning that over time they fade or wash away faster than
        the more stable pigments around them, leaving gaps which were once coloured.
        \ Chemical analyses have shown that a major binder (used to coalesce dry pigment

      title: Interpretation
      title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 11'
      body: "Namibian rock paintings, and most engravings, have largely been interpreted
        in the vein largely espoused by  researchers over the past 30 years.  This
        postulates that much of this rock art reflects the experience of San|Bushman
        shamans entering trance states and that rather than being scenes from daily
        life, the depictions of animals and activities are highly symbolic within
        San|Bushman cosmology, with images acting as reservoirs of spiritual power.
        \ This avenue of interpretation originates largely from the study of rock
        art in South Africa and Lesotho.  While it appears broadly applicable here,
        the fact that direct attributions to known cultural groups in this area are
        difficult somewhat hinders direct comparisons with Namibian rock art.  While
        hunter-gatherer rock painting production in South Africa was practiced until
        the recent past, it appears to have ceased in Namibia around a thousand  years
        ago and modern San|Bushman groups in the Kalahari area have no tradition of
        rock art production.   \n\nAdditionally, hundreds of miles and different geographical
        environments separate the rock art centres of north-western Namibia from those
        in neighbouring countries. This is particularly apparent in the differences
        in terms of animal subject matter, with the numerous depictions of gemsbok
        and springbok, explicable by the rock art creators being semi-desert dwellers
        where gemsbok and springbok are found locally though largely absent from rock
        art elsewhere in southern Africa, where these animals are not found. \n"

      body: "Other differences are found in style and emphasis: the frequency with
        which giraffe feature in Namibian paintings and engravings contrasts with
        the South African rock art, where the emphasis is more on the eland antelope.
        \ This has led some to propose that the giraffe, similarly, must have held
        a particular symbolic meaning for the painters of the region.  Based on associated
        imagery, placement of the rock art sites, and some ethnography (written records
        of insights from contemporary San|Bushman culture compiled by anthropologists)
        it has been suggested that giraffes may have been linked with rain in local
        belief systems, with some Namibian rock painting sites are associated specifically
        with rainmaking or healing activities. \n\nWhile the more naturalistic examples
        of engravings are thought to have also been produced by ancient hunter-gatherers,
        as with the paintings, it has been suggested that some geometric engravings
        were produced  by herding people, possibly ancestral Khoenkhoen, perhaps in
        relation to initiation rites.  Schematic finger paintings have also been attributed
        to pastoralist people.  All attributions are tentative, however, because the
        majority of the art is thought to be many hundreds of years old and the historical
        distinctions between hunter-gatherers and herders is by no means clear-cut
        in the archaeological record.\n"

      body: "The pieces from the cave Wendt excavated (named ‘Apollo 11 Cave’ after
        the moon mission which took place during the period of the excavation work)
        are not thought to have fallen from a cave wall but were made on loose rock
        pieces.  The only parietal art (on a fixed rock surface) dated from excavated
        deposits in Namiba so far consists of pieces of painted granite from the largest
        painted shelter in the Brandberg, one of which, found in a sedimentary layer
        radiocarbon dated to around 2,700 years ago, had clearly fallen from an exposed
        rock surface into which researchers were able to refit it. Aside from this,
        estimates at the age of rock art are based on superimposition, patination
        and associated archaeological finds. \n\nBased on archaeological evidence,
        it is thought that the majority of the fine-line hunter-gatherer rock art
        in the Brandberg area was produced between around 4,000 and 2,000 years ago,
        with the painting tradition in the wider region starting as much as 6,000
        years ago. This ceased sometime after the introduction of small domestic stock
        to the area, although not immediately, as fine-line paintings of sheep and
        paintings and engravings of cattle testify.   Across central Namibia, there
        appears to be a particularly strong correspondence of finds relating to paintings—such
        as grinding equipment and pigments—with dated layers from the 1st millennium
        BC.\n"

      body: 'Engravings are more difficult to obtain dates for scientifically. Superimpositioning
        and other physical factors can serve to indicate which styles of image are
        more recent with both paintings and engravings. For example, in the Brandberg,
        monochrome tableaux appear older than detailed polychrome depictions of individuals,
        and certain images, such as those of zebras, are thought to be relatively
        late.  Among engravings of central Namibia, a certain style of hoof print
        appears to overlie some figurative images, leading researchers to believe
        them younger.  Overall it is thought that the engraving and painting traditions
        were concurrent, with some clear parallels in style, but that engraving probably
        lasted for several hundred years as a tradition after painting ceased.  '

        located in the Namibe province on the south-west corner of Angola, by the
        edge of the Namib desert, about 120 km from the sea.  It is a semi-arid plain
        characterized by the presence of several inselbergs (isolated hills rising
        from the plain), the most important of which is Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume.  The
        group of rock art sites are surrounded by several seasonal rivers, within
        a maximum distance of 1 km.  Tchitundu-Hulu was first documented by José Camarate
        Andrade França in 1953, and since then it has become one of the most studied
        rock art sites in Angola, attracting the interest of renowned researchers
        such as  Abbé Breuil, J.  Desmond Clark and Santos Junior.  In 2014 one of
        the sites was the subject of a Masters dissertation (Caema 2014), the latest
        addition to the long term research on the site.  '

        three or even more colours, and consist mainly of geometric signs, although
        there are anthropomorphs and zoomorphs, in some cases grouped in what seem
        hunting scenes.  The other two sites (the Rock of the Zebras and the Rock
        of the Pond) consist of engravings similar to those of Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume,
        and in some cases their different patinas show that they were made in different
        periods.  '

      body: 'The chronology of the Tchitundu-Hulu rock art is difficult to establish,
        and it is unclear if the four sites are of the same period at all.  Theories
        based on the lithic tools dispersed throughout the area ascribed the paintings
        to an ancient time period, possibly  tens of thousands of years old.  Radiocarbon
        samples coming from the excavation of Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume showed a date
        in the early 1st millennium BC, although the relation of the archaeological
        remains and the paintings has not been proved and archaeological materials
        of a more modern period were also located.  A sample taken from the pigments
        at the site rendered a date of the beginning of the first centuries of the
        1st millennium AD.  In any case, Tchitundu-Hulu hosts some of the oldest examples
        of rock art in the country, and it has been linked to the schematic traditions
        that characterize the rock art of Central Africa, more abundant in central
        Mozambique and Malawi.  '

      body: The question of who made the engravings or paintings is another complex
        issue for the interpretation of the Tchitundu-Hulu depictions.  The harsh
        conditions of this semi-desert area probably favoured a seasonal occupation
        of the region during the rainy season.  The location of Tchitundu-Hulu at
        the edge of the desert could also have made this place a strategic site for
        the communities living in the region.  Several local groups - Kwisi, Kuvale
        - have traditionally inhabited the area, but the authorship of these engravings
        and paintings and the motives for creating them remains obscure, as does the
        purpose and cultural context of the complex images of Tchitundu-Hulu.

      title: Geography and rock art distribution
      title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 2'
      body: Angola has a variety of climates.  The flat coastal plain ranges between
        25 and 150 km in width, and is a semiarid region covered by scrub, turning
        into sand dunes to the south, near Namibia.  The coastal region abruptly gives
        way to a series of mountains and escarpments divided  by the Cuanza River.  The
        northern part has an average height of 500 m, but the southern region is far
        higher, with the peaks occasionally exceeding 2,300 m.  This mountainous region
        is in fact a transitional area between the coastal plain and the great central
        plateau of Africa.  This plateau dominates Angola’s geography with an altitude
        from 1,200 to 1,800 m, and consists of a region of plains and low hills with
        a tropical climate.  The climate becomes drier to the south and wetter to
        the north, where a wide region of the country can be defined as rainforest.

        mention of a rock art site was made in 1816 with research only starting in
        1939, when José Redinha published the first news about engravings of Angola.  Since
        then, research was intermittent until the 1950s, when the important site of
        Tchitundu-Hulu was studied and published.  The relevance of Tchitundu-Hulu
        attracted the attention of important scholars such as Desmond Clark and the  Abbé
        Breuil, who along with Portuguese researchers contextualized Angolan rock
        art within the continent.  Research increased significantly over the next
        two decades, but during the 1980s political instability gave way to a period
        of stagnation until the 1990s, when new researchers began comprehensive surveys
        and organised the available rock art information.  '

      body: 'The rock art in Angola has a wide variety of styles and themes, depending
        on the region and the chronology.  The oldest images are painted or engraved
        geometric symbols and anthropomorphic figures.  More recent depictions include
        axes, spears and firearms.  The latest period of the Angolan rock art includes
        complex scenes of war and hunting, and in a number of cases human figures
        carried on a palanquin-like structure.  Although schematic figures are widespread
        throughout the country, they are predominant in the south-west where most
        of the sites have been compared to those in the Central Africa Schematic Art
        zone, with parallels in Malawi and Mozambique.  In the west-central area of
        Angola, in addition to the schematic symbols and animals, images of men holding
        weapons, fighting and hunting are common, including warriors holding firearms
        which make reference to the first contact with Europeans by the 16th century.  Near
        the north-west coast, some of the paintings and engravings have been related
        to objects used in religious ceremonies –wooden statuettes or decorated pot
        lids.  In particular, a close association has been establish between rock
        art depictions and the so-called Cabinda pot lids, which have different carved
        symbols—animals, objects, human figures—acting as a shared visual language.  '

      title: " Chronology"
      title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 6'
      body: 'As is so often the case with rock art, the dating of images is complex
        due to the absence of direct correlations between rock art depictions and
        well contextualised archaeological remains.  Some of the sites with rock art
        have been excavated showing dates of the 7th millennium BC, but the relationship
        with the rock art is unclear.  In the Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume site, the excavation
        at the cave provided a 1st millennium BC date, and the only radiocarbon date
        taken from the pigments at this site provided a date of the 1st century AD,
        which corresponds with other dates of the same style in Central Africa.  The
        second tool for assigning a chronology is the analysis of the subject matter
        represented in the rock art depictions: the presence of metal objects, for
        example, would imply a date of the 1st millennium AD onwards, when this material
        was introduced.  Whereas, depictions featuring images of firearms would date
        from the 16th century onwards.  The end of the rock art tradition has been
        associated with the presence of Europeans but was probably progressive as
        the control of the region by the Portuguese grew during the 17th and 18th
        centuries.  '

        art sites with more than 4,000 individual paintings, and has been termed the
        “The Louvre of the Desert”.  Designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in
        2001, Tsodilo comprises four main hill: Male Hill, Female Hill, Child Hill
        and North Hill with paintings occurring on all four. This region shows human
        occupation going back 100,000 years.  At sunset the western cliffs of the
        Hills radiate a glowing light that can be seen for miles around, for which
        the local Juc’hoansi  call them the “Copper Bracelet of the Evening”.'

      title: Rock Art
      title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 2'
      body: The paintings at Tsodilo are unique in comparison to other San|Bushmen
        rock art in both techniques and subject matter. San|Bushmen paintings are
        well-known throughout southern Africa for their fine-line detail because they
        were brush painted, but those at Tsodilo are finger painted. In addition,
        160 depictions of cattle are portrayed in the same style as wild animals,
        and more geometric designs appear here than anywhere else. Tsodilo animal
        drawings are larger and the geometric designs simpler than those found elsewhere.  In
        comparison to human figures elsewhere in southern Africa, those at Tsodilo
        appear without bows and arrows, clothing or any forms of personal ornamentation.  In
        addition, numerous cupules and grooves are incised and ground into rock surfaces,
        sometimes close to painted rock art sites and some on their own. For the residents
        of Tsodilo, the hills are a sacred place inhabited by spirits of the ancestors.

        mammals and cattle have been depicted in twisted perspective with two horns

      title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 6'
      body: While most of the images in the Tsodilo Hills seem to be discrete depictions,
        some sites show figures. Some of these figures are with cattle as well as
        women standing in rows in connection with animal groups, possibly showing
        some relationship with each other. Additionally, some of the rock art in the
        Tsodilo Hills shows superimposition, but this occurs infrequently. In some
        cases red geometric designs superimpose animals, but geometric designs and
        animals never superimpose human figures, nor do images of cattle ever superimpose
        other images – which may suggest some kind of relationship or hierarchy.

      body: White finger-painted images appear more crudely executed and are made
        from a powdery or greasy white pigment. More than 200 paintings at 20 different
        sites show paintings in this style, half of these depictions occur in White
        Paintings Shelter alone. Subject matter includes people facing forwards with
        their hands on hips, figures riding horses, a possible wagon wheel and a figure
        standing on a wagon, as well as an elephant, rhino, giraffe, eland, cows,
        antelope, snakes, unidentified animals and geometric designs, particularly
        “m” shapes. White paintings occur at sites with red paintings and often superimpose
        them.

      title: Cupules/Grooves
      title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 8'
      body: There are no engravings at Tsodilo representing animals or human figures,
        but more than 25 sites show evidence of small round depressions ground into
        the rock, known as cupules, as well as various shaped grooves that have been
        chipped and ground into the rock. The majority of sites are found on Female
        Hill, with four on Male Hill and one site on Child Hill. Cupules tend to measure
        about 5cm or more wide and less than a 1 cm deep, although larger examples
        occur. They can occur at painted rock art sites but also on their own. For
        the most part they are found in groups ranging from 5 to 100 and in three
        cases, considerably more. For example, in Rhino Cave there are 346 carved
        into a vertical wall and nearly 1,100 at Depression Shelter. The purpose or
        meaning of cupules is unknown; they may have denoted a special place or the
        number of times a site had been visited. However, we have no dates for any
        of the cupules and even if they are adjacent to a rock art site, they are
        not necessarily contemporaneous. From their patina and general wear it has
        been proposed that some cupules may date back tens of thousands of years to
        the Middle Stone Age. If paintings also existed at this time they have long
        since disappeared.

      body: Grooves are less common than cupules, but are often easier to detect.
        They occur in small groups of 3 to 15 and are elongated oval or canoe-like
        in shape, and are found mostly on horizontal or near-horizontal surfaces.
        Their function is unknown, although a thin slab of stone with a curved round
        edge was excavated from Depression Shelter which matched one of the grooves
        in the shelter.

      title: Who were the artists?
      title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 10'
      body: "It is a bit of a mystery about who actually created the paintings at
        Tsodilo, as the red images at Tsodilo do not fit neatly into other known styles
        of rock art in southern Africa. They do not show the fine brush work of San|Bushmen¹
        in other parts of southern Africa, nor the cruder style of white paintings
        attributed to later Bantu-speaking farmers.\n\nIt is possible that they were
        painted by the Khoesan during the first millennium AD, the original settlers
        in the area who made stone tools and herded livestock. A local Ncaekhoe man
        (a Central San people) claims his ancestors made the paintings and it is possible
        that some or many of the cattle images were painted by pastoral ancestors
        of Ncaekhoe. \n\nThe white paintings are more difficult to attribute authorship,
        although as they are comparable to the red paintings, comprising the same
        subject matter of elephant, rhino, giraffe and antelope as well as geometrics,
        they may reflect a later version of the red tradition.\n\n"

      title: Dating
      title_internal: 'Botswana: featured site, chapter 11'
      body: The paintings at Tsodilo are often faded because they are located on rock
        faces exposed to the sun, wind and rain. As such, dating them scientifically
        is problematic as little or no suitable organic material remains. However,
        cattle paintings may help to date the art. There are about 160 depictions
        of cattle, which were common around the Tsodilo Hills between 800–1200 AD.
        As the cattle depictions are stylistically similar to other animal depictions
        it has been suggested that this seems to be a plausible date for most of the
        art (Coulson and Campbell, 2001:103)

        a major trade centre and seemingly the local cattle population collapsed. '

      body: "Giraffe, eland and rhino are by far the most common species depicted
        at Tsodilo, followed by elephant, gemsbok and cattle. However, these images
        tend to be discretely rendered and there does not appear to be any relationship
        between images on the same rock. \n\nRepresentations of people are simply
        painted and generally stick-like, identified to gender by either penis or
        breasts. In some cases this may represent sexual virility and fertility, although
        in scenes where both occur it may merely indicate gender differences.\n\nCattle
        seem to appear in the rock art at the same time as human figures. In one scene,
        three figures, one leading a child, has been interpreted as either herding
        or stealing cattle (Campbell, Robbins and Taylor, 2010:106). Three other sites
        show cattle depicted with what may be mythical rain animals. \n"

        In Zambia, geometric designs are thought to have been be made by women and
        associated with the weather and fertility, while depictions of animals were
        made by men. The geometric rock art of Tsodilo fits into a pattern of similar

      title: Geography and rock art distribution
      title_internal: 'Botswana: country, chapter 2'
      body: The Republic of Botswana is bordered by South Africa to the south, Namibia
        to the west and north and Zimbabwe to the north-east. It shares a short border
        consisting of a few hundred metres with Zambia to the north. The majority
        of this flat country, around 70%, is made up of the Kalahari Desert, with
        the Okavango Delta, one of the world’s largest inland deltas located in the
        north. Botswana has a subtropical climate of hot summers and warm winters
        due to its high altitude and is semi-arid due to the short rainy season. Rock
        art is scattered across the country with the main sites being found in the
        Tsodilo Hills in the north- west;  the Gubatshaa Hills in the Chobe National
        Park, east of the Okavango Delta;  Tuli Block in the far east of the country
        and Manyana in the south-east.

        German geologist Siegfried Passarge visited the Tsodilo Hills on the 1st July 1898, mapping the area, writing on the geology and photographing a few rock paintings. In 1907, he published tracings of his photos in Die Buschmänner der Kalahari. A passing mention of the Hills was made in 1913 in a brief report by Max Happe, but it was François Balsan, a French industrialist and explorer, who raised the profile of Tsodilo Hills when over two days he photographed and prepared tracings of what has come to be known as the “Rhino Panel” on September 27-28 1951.

        Laurens van der Post’s publication of *The Lost World of the Kalahari* in 1958 brought Tsodilo Hills and its rock art to the attention of the wider world. Van der Post, an Afrikaner, had planned to make a film of the rock art in the region, but a number of events including the shooting of a steenbok (a severe crime locally), the cameras jamming and swarms of bees descending upon their camp, conspired against him and resulted in van der Post leaving the Hills in despair. However, he also left an apologetic note at the rock art panel he had been trying to film as a way of assuaging the wrath of the “Spirit of the Hills” as he put it. The rock face he was trying to film, comprising eland, giraffe and handprints, is now known as “Van der Post Panel”.

        In 1963 Alec Campbell visited the region with George Silberbauer, an ethnographer who had studied the San|Bushmen in Botswana. As Director of Botswana’s National Museum, Campbell had a little government funding to record the rock art and excavate the rock shelters. Subsequently he collaborated with archaeologists Larry Robbins, Mike Murphy, and paleo-geographer George Brook.

        During the 1990s, Campbell, along with the staff from the National Museum recorded around 400 rock art sites numbering over 4,000 individual paintings. In 2001 Tsodilo Hills became a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its spiritual significance to local peoples, as well as its unique record of human settlement over many millennia.

        Tuli Block is a narrow fringe of land in the far east of the country that borders South Africa and lies on the banks of the Limpopo River. This area is characterised by rock engravings of human and animal footprints, and cupules, which hold spiritual importance both for San|Bushman¹ hunter-gatherers and Tswana farmers. The engravings are thought to refer to a local myth that tells of an ancestor, named Matsieng, who is believed to have emerged from a waterhole followed by his animals. However, there are several localities in the region that claim this origin myth. It is thought the engravings in this area were created by the San|Bushmen and linked to their belief system, appropriated later by the Tswana farmers.

        The most renowned rock art in Botswana comes from the Tsodilo Hills in the north-west of the country. With more than 4,500 paintings preserved in an area of 10km² it has been termed the “Louvre of the Desert”.  Tsodilo is made up of four main hills; Male Hill, Female Hill, Child Hill and North Hill, and paintings occur on all four. The subject matter, comprised of red and white paintings, includes animals, human figures and geometric designs. Red paintings are likely to have been made by San|Bushmen, while the white paintings are more difficult to attribute authorship to but may be a later continuation of the red tradition. There are no engraved images at Tsodilo but cupules and ground grooves are a common feature.  Dating of the paintings at Tsodilo has been difficult, and because many of them occur on exposed surfaces where they are susceptible to damage by the sun, rain and wind, what remains is probably not very old. However, paintings of cattle, which are also badly faded, probably date to between AD 800 and 1150 when people kept these animals in this area.

        ¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

        dating to the Late Stone Age, around AD 100 - 800, with the latest occupation
        levels dating to the Late Iron Age, around AD 1600-1700. Interestingly, none
        of the paintings were done in white, a colour found at many other sites in
        Botswana and other regions of southern Africa, and often attributed to paintings

        in southern Africa.  These may include fertility, health, abundance, protection
        against evil spirits or summoning rain. Contemporary communities at Tsodilo
        Hills believe that spirits live in the Hills and have explained how those
        who enter the Hills must be respectful as the spirits are capable of both
        curing and punishing people. In particular, White Paintings Shelter in the
        Tsodilo Hills was used as a place to perform curative dances that involved
        the placing of hands on the paintings in order to use its power. Geometric
        designs are more difficult to interpret but may fit into a tradition of other
        geometric symbols in the region and represent weather and fertility symbols.

        many of the other sites, which are grouped together, the Namzeze shelter is
        isolated in the centre of the protected area.  Located in a position overlooking
        the valley towards the Chongoni Hill, the impressive rock face of Namzeze
        contains some of the best examples of both traditions of Malawian rock art,
        the red schematic and white paintings.  The site also has a strong symbolism
        for the Chewa people who still inhabit the area and for whom the white paintings
        of the later period still have deep spiritual implications. '

      body: "The superimpositions in the panel above show that the red, schematic
        paintings covering most of the rock face are undoubtedly older than those
        made in white.  Representations include a multitude of geometric signs: series
        of parallel lines, grid-style shapes, concentric ovals and circular shapes
        made with series of dots.  In some cases the red signs were infilled with
        series of tiny white dots, a feature uncommon in the red schematic rock art
        depictions but with the best examples represented here in Namzeze.  Its interpretation,
        as with most geometric depictions, is a challenging issue, but these types
        of paintings have been traditionally related to ancestors of  Batwa people,
        hunter-gatherers, who inhabited the region until the 1800s.  Studies of Batwa
        ethnography and cosmology point to these places as related to fertility and
        rainmaking ceremonies.  It is difficult to establish the chronology.  The
        oldest occupation documented in the region is dated to the mid-first millennium
        BC, and the red images precede the arrival of the Chewa people in the 2nd
        millennium AD, responsible for the white paintings style, but there is no
        datable evidence for the paintings.  \n"

      body: The second type of painting found in Namzeze is radically different and
        depicts mainly quadrupeds and birds, as well as some geometric symbols and
        a car, proof of a relatively recent date for some of these paintings. Quadrupeds
        have a very characteristic rectangular body and hooves that in some cases
        are represented as feet.  The technique is very different too, consisting
        of white clay daubed on the wall with the fingers.  These white figures usually
        appear surrounding the previous depictions, in some rare occasions overlapping
        them.  In this case, the authorship, chronology and interpretation of the
        paintings are more straightforward.  Researchers agree that these types of
        paintings have been made by the Chewa, a group of farmers that arrived to
        the region around the 16th century and have maintained rock art painting traditions
        until the 20th century (as the car represented in this shelter proves).

        to the *nyau*, a secret society of the Chewa and other neighbouring groups
        in Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique which plays a significant role in funerary
        and girl’s initiation ceremonies.  The *nyau* rituals include dancing and
        rely heavily on the use of masks, including face masks as well as other mobile
        structures carried by one or two people.  These masks are central for the
        *nyau* secret society and are kept in secret, hidden from non-initiates.  The
        white paintings of Namzeze and many other sites have been interpreted as representations
        of masks, depicted during initiation ceremonies that took place in these isolated
        shelters where secrets of the *nyau* were explained to the new initiates.  '

      body: "In fact, some of the more than 100 types of masks can be easily identified
        in the rock shelters.  The most common is the *kasiyamaliro*, a big structure
        representing an antelope, with a rectangular shape and meant to be carried
        by two people (an [excellent example](http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=472359&partId=1)
        can be seen in Room 25 in the British Museum), but others, such as the *Galimoto*
        (a car structure) and birds are also documented.  Some of the features of
        the animals depicted in this panel corroborate with this interpretation: the
        shape of the hooves which is more similar to feet, and the fact that in some
        cases the feet of the forelegs and the hind legs are facing each other, as
        if they corresponded to two different people. Some researchers have interpreted
        this feature as a pictorial tool to teach people the proper way of wearing
        and using the structure to avoid stumbling, which would expose the men hidden
        in the structure and thus the secret of the mask would be revealed.  \n"

        20th century. With their traditional practices and places forbidden, the members
        of this society had to look for alternative ways to teach the secrets of the
        secret society secrets, with the paintings starting to represent *nyau* objects,
        to be used as a didactic tool.  The Namzeze paintings show very explicitly
        the adaptability of societies to their different challenges and historical
        contexts. Either as a tool to summon the rain or as a coded message to transmit
        sacred secrets, the painted symbols depicted in Namzeze show the incredible
        complexity of rock art meanings throughout time, and their importance for
        the communities that painted them.  \n"

      body: "Malawi is a landlocked country in south-eastern Africa, located between
        Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. It stretches from north to south with the
        eastern boundary of the country marked by the Lake Malawi. Rock art can be
        found throughout the country but is especially abundant in central Malawi,
        near the western border with Mozambique. It consists exclusively of paintings
        attributed to two very distinctive groups (hunter-gatherers and farmers),
        and shows obvious links with other sites located in Zambia and western Mozambique.
        The images consist mainly of animals, anthropomorphic figures and geometric
        symbols, with a chronology that ranges from the Late Stone Age to the 1950s.

        Nyasa). Almost 600 km long and more than 50 km wide, Lake Malawi is the second
        biggest lake in Africa and a key geographical feature of Malawi and the surrounding
        countries, as well as an important economic resource for the country. The
        rest of the country west of the Rift Valley is dominated by high plateaus,
        mostly ranging from 900-1200 m above sea level but reaching 2500 m in the
        Nyika Plateau to the north and 3000 m at Mt. Mulanje, to the south. The climate
        is equatorial, with strong seasonal differences, and hotter in the southern
        part of the country. '

        Malawi, very near the border with Mozambique. In that area around 150 rock
        art sites have been located so far, belonging to the two main traditions of
        rock art found in the country. Other smaller concentrations of rock art can
        be found to the south and to the north-west, and around the southern side
        of Lake Malawi. The distribution of the different styles of Malawian rock
        art varies substantially: while the older paintings attributed to hunter-gatherers
        can be found everywhere throughout the country, those made by farmers are
        concentrated in the Chongoni area, as well as nearby areas of Mozambique and
        Zambia. Rock art is usually scattered throughout the landscape, in hilly areas
        where gneiss outcrops provide shelters and well-protected surfaces adequate

      title: Research history
      title_internal: 'Malawi: country, chapter 4'
      body: 'Rock art in Malawi has been documented by Europeans since at least the
        1920s, although it wasn’t until the 1950s when the first articles on the subject
        were published, and it was only in 1978 a first synthesis on Malawian rock
        art was undertaken (Lindgren, N.E.  & Schoffeleers, J.M. 1978). In the 1980s
        research increased, especially on Chongoni rock art as its importance as a
        secret society artefact became evident. In 1995 the Chongoni rock art area
        was comprehensively studied by Benjamin Smith as a part of his doctoral research
        (1995), which is still the main reference on the topic. Most of the research
        on Malawi rock art has focused on the study of the two different painting
        traditions found in Malawi. A basic proposal was made in 1978 when the red
        paintings—mostly geometric—considered older and attributed to hunter-gatherers,
        while white paintings were related to more modern groups of farmers which
        arrived early in the 2nd millennium AD and preserved their painting traditions
        until the 1950s. Since 1978, the knowledge of these two groups has substantially
        improved, with a more refined proposal made by Benjamin Smith in his doctoral
        dissertation.  '

        schematic paintings with parallels in Central Africa from Malawi to Angola.
        These paintings are associated with the ancestors of modern Batwa hunter-gatherers,
        and can be classified into two different types. The first can be considered
        the most characteristic and is represented by circles with radiating lines,
        concentric circles, ovals, wavy or parallel lines. In some cases, red figures
        are infilled in white painting or white dots. The second type is very scarce
        (only two examples have been found in Chongoni) and depicts very schematic
        animals, sometimes accompanied by humans. Both types are finely executed with
        red oxide pigment. Regarding their interpretation, the figures seem to have
        been associated with rainmaking and fertility concepts. '

      body: 'The second and more modern rock art tradition found in Malawi is represented
        by white figures made with white clay daubed onto rock surfaces with the finger.
        Associated with the agriculturalist Chewa people, the depictions usually represent
        zoomorphic, spread-eagled or snake-like figures which could represent mythological
        beings, sometimes accompanied by geometric symbols.  As in the case of the
        schematic figures, two types of paintings have been proposed: those related
        to spread-eagled figures and those representing zoomorphs (animal-like figures).
        The paintings were made until several decades ago, as testified by depictions
        of cars that can be found at some sites. In this case, the interpretation
        of the paintings is straightforward, as the images depicted can still be related
        to current rituals often employing masks in a variety of shapes.  The spread-eagled
        paintings may be associated with a Chewa girl’s initiation ceremony and would
        act as a mnemonic tool during the ritual, while the zoomorphic paintings may
        depict spirit characters of the Chewa men’s secret society, the *nyau*. In
        many cases, these paintings can overlap the older red paintings already existing
        at some sites'

        to the archaeological record is around 2,500 years ago, and it is generally
        assumed that Late Stone Age hunters and gatherers made this rock art. Unfortunately
        no datable evidence has been found although groups of these people survived
        until the 1800s in Malawi. For the white paintings, chronologies are more

      body: The Kondoa rock art sites are located on the eastern slopes of the Maasai
        escarpment, which borders the western side of the Great Rift Valley in central
        Tanzania, covering an area of over 2,336 km². Stretching for around 18 km
        along the escarpment, the exact number of rock art sites in the Kondoa area
        is unknown but is estimated to be up to 450, the oldest of which are thought
        be more than 2,000 years old. The extensive and spectacular collection of
        rock paintings are attributable to both hunter-gatherer and pastoralist communities
        and the images are testament to the changing socio-economic environment in
        the region. The hunter-gatherer rock paintings of Kondoa are dominated by
        human figures and animals. While a dark reddish brown predominates, other
        colours include yellow, orange, red and white.  Some of the shelters are still
        considered to have cultural associations with the people who live nearby,
        reflecting their beliefs, rituals and cosmological traditions. In 2006, Kondoa
        was nominated and listed as one of UNESCO’s World Heritage rock art sites
        in Africa.

      body: "The sites at Kolo are the most famous of the Kondoa paintings. Kolo comprises
        three rock art sites, known as Kolo 1, 2 and 3. The main site, Kolo 1 (known
        locally as Mongomi wa Kolo) is a large, imposing rock shelter that is only
        accessible by following a winding path at the end of a dirt road. This site
        contains many fine-line red paintings, some of which are very faded; but the
        site is still used by the local community for secret rituals. Kolo 2 is located
        south of the main site and includes human and animal figures, while Kolo 3
        is north of Kolo1 and is characterised by human, animal and geometric figures.
        The renowned palaeontologist Mary Leakey surveyed and documented many of the
        paintings at Kolo in the 1950s.  The examples we see here are thought to have
        been made by early hunter-gatherer groups, ancestors of the modern Sandawe,
        one of the first cultural groups to inhabit Kondoa.   \n\n"

        eland, rhinoceros and wildebeest; while human figures are represented as slender
        and elongated, often with elaborate hairstyles or headdresses, holding bows
        and arrows. Groups of figures are also shown bent at the waist, with some
        appearing to take on animal characteristics. These paintings have been associated
        with Sandawe cultural beliefs. \n\nThe Sandawe communicate with the spirits
        by taking on the power of an animal and some features at Mongomi wa Kolo can
        be understood by reference to the Sandawe traditional practice known as simbó
        (Ten Raa 1971, 1974). Developing Ten Raa’s observations, Lewis-Williams (1986)
        proposed that simbó is the ritual of being a lion, and that simbó dancers
        are believed to turn into lions. Lim (1992, 1996) adopted a site-specific
        approach to the rock art and has suggested that the importance of place is
        as important as the images themselves. According to Lim the potency of a place
        is produced through ritual activities, so that meaning resides in the process
        of painting in a particular location, rather than in the painted image itself.

        Ritual Practices

        Ritual sites are generally located near fig and baobab trees, and springs. However, about 3 m south of the main Kolo shelter, a cavity underneath a huge boulder is used, even today, by local diviners, healers and rainmakers to invoke visions and communicate with the spirits. Oral traditions indicate that Mongomi wa Kolo is considered more powerful than other ritual places in Kondoa, and its unusual location may contribute to its efficacy.  The other two shelters of Kolo 2 and 3 are also used for ritual ceremonies.

        __Conservation__

        When Mary Leakey was surveying the Kondoa rock paintings in 1983 she predicted that if serious preservation and conservation measures were not put in place the paintings would be destroyed by 2020. Although inscribed onto the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2006, it has been noted paintings are being destroyed by the dust from the ground and in some cases rainwater is causing the paintings to deteriorate.

        Moreover, the documentation of paintings at Kondoa is incomplete, and some areas have not been surveyed at all. Bwasiri (2008) advocates an urgent need to collate all existing information in this region and implement a sites and monuments record that also takes into account living heritage values.

      title_internal: Tanzania Chapter 1
      body: Containing some of the densest concentrations of rock art in East Africa,
        Tanzania includes many different styles and periods of rock art, the earliest
        of which may date back 10,000 years. Consisting mainly of paintings, rock
        art is found predominantly in the Kondoa region and the adjoining Lake Eyasi
        basin. Those at Kondoa were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2006,
        and were the first to be documented by missionaries in 1908.

      title: Geography and Rock Art distribution
      title_internal: Tanzania Chapter 2
      body: |-
        Situated within the Great Lakes Region of East Africa, Tanzania is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and the Indian Ocean to the east, with a coastline of approx. 800km. At 947,303 km², Tanzania is the largest country in East Africa and is home to Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro (5,895 m, 19,340 feet), located in the north-east of the country.

        Central Tanzania is comprised largely of a plateau, which is mainly grassland and contains many national parks. The north of the country is predominantly arable and includes the national capital of Dodoma. The north-east of the country is mountainous and contains the eastern arm of the Great Rift Valley. Further north-west is Lake Victoria adjoining the Kenya–Uganda–Tanzania border. Concentrations of rock art are found mainly in the Kondoa province of central Tanzania and also the Lake Eyasi Basin in the north of the country.


        The rock art of the Lake Eyasi Basin and that of Kondoa share many similarities related to subject matter, styles, pigments and even types of sites. This may possibly reflect a shared art tradition among hunter-gatherers, which is feasible as there are no natural barriers preventing the movement of cultural ideas and techniques.

      title: History of rock art research in Tanzania
      title_internal: Tanzania Chapter 3
      body: 'The existence of painted rock art was first reported  to Europeans in
        1908 by missionaries, but the first scientific explorations date back to the
        1930s. Early surveys were undertaken by Ludwig Kohl-Larsen (1958), a German
        physician, amateur anthropologist and explorer, who traced images in more
        than 70 rock shelters in 1935. The renowned paleoanthropologists Mary and
        Louis Leakey (1983) were the first to extensively study the rock art of Tanzania
        during the 1930s and 1950s (having noted many sites in the 1920s), documenting
        over 1600 painted images at 186 sites north of Kondoa. In the late 1970s and
        during the 1980s Fidelis Masao (1979) surveyed 68 rock paintings sites and
        excavated four of them while Emmanuel Anati (1996) recorded 200 sites in Kondoa.
        Other researchers include Eric ten Raa (1971, 1974), David Lewis-Williams
        (1986), Imogene Lim (1992), and Emmanuel Bwasiri (2008, 2011); all of whom
        have recorded numerous sites, contributing to identifying chronologies, styles
        and possible interpretations. Conservation and preservation of the rock art
        has been of importance since the 1930s, and many of the paintings recorded
        by the Leakeys in the early 1950s are now severely deteriorated, or in some
        cases completely destroyed. '

      title: Chronologies
      title_internal: Tanzania Chapter 4
      body: "Scholars have classified the rock art in Tanzania into three main stylistic
        groups:  Hunter-gatherer, also known as Sandawe, Pastoral, and Late Whites.
        Hunter-gatherer and Late White paintings are often found in the same rock
        shelters and in some instances, all three types occur at the same site. \n\nNo
        paintings have been scientifically dated, but some researchers have proposed
        the earliest dates for the art: Anati (1996) has suggested paintings at Kondoa
        may be up to 40,000 years old; Leakey (1985) and Coulson and Campbell (2001)
        up to 10,000 years old. Masao (1979) has estimated the earliest art at perhaps
        3000 years old. These are estimates and not based on radiometric dating techniques,
        and as the paintings have been exposed to considerable weathering these very
        early dates currently cannot be substantiated.\n\n__Hunter-gatherer__\n\nHunter-gatherer
        or Sandawe rock art is characterised by fine-line paintings and includes images
        of animals, human figures, handprints and circular designs. These are the
        earliest paintings, thought to date to between 3,000-10,000 years ago, and
        are attributed to the ancestral Sandawe, a hunter-gatherer group indigenous
        to north-east Tanzania. \n\nThis tradition of rock art occurs in the Kondoa
        region, with just a few hundred sites in a concentration of less than a 100km
        in diameter and corresponding closely to the known distribution of the Sandawe
        people. Animals, such as giraffe, elephant, rhinoceros, antelope, plus a few
        birds and reptiles, dogs and possibly bees, make up more than half of the
        images depicted. In addition there are a few animal tracks depicted: cloven
        hooves, porcupine and aardvark.  \n"

        Typically, human figures are slender and elongated, wearing large elaborate coiffures or headdresses, and sometimes with animal heads.  Occasionally they are bent at the waist but they always appear in groups or pairs. A few of the figures are painted with bows and arrows and occur with animals, although whether these represent a hunting scene is uncertain. Women are very scarce. The few handprints present are painted depictions rather than stencils and circular designs are made up of concentric circles sometimes with elaborate rays and occasional rectangles and finger dots.

        __Pastoral__

        About 3,000 years ago, Cushitic herders from Ethiopia moved into the region, and were followed by Nilotic cattle pastoralists, ancestors of today’s Maasai. In comparison to hunter-gatherer rock art, Pastoral rock art yields many fewer paintings and generally depicts cattle in profile, and sometimes sheep and/or goats, a few dogs and figures holding sticks and bows. Predominantly painted in black and sometimes red and white, the colour of many images has now faded to a dull grey colour.

        __Late White__

        Late White paintings are crude, finger painted images and often superimpose older images. These were made by Bantu-speaking, iron-working farmers who moved into the region in the last 300-500 years.  The most common type of depiction are designs and motifs that include circles, some of which have rays emanating outwards,  concentric circles, patterns of dots and grids with outlines, what look like stick figures with multiple arms, as well as handprints. Animal depictions include giraffe, elephant, antelope, snakes, reptiles, baboons and domestic species. Human figures are less common, but when present are notably men facing forwards with hands on hips, sometimes holding weapons.

      Central Africa is dominated by vast river systems and lakes, particularly the Congo River Basin. Characterised by hot and wet weather on both sides of the equator, central Africa has no regular dry season, but aridity increases in intensity both north and south of the equator. Covered with a forest of about 400,000 m² (1,035,920 km²), it is one of the greenest parts of the continent.  The rock art of central Africa stretches from the Zambezi River to the Angolan Atlantic coast and reaches as far north as Cameroon and Uganda. Termed the ‘schematic rock art zone’ by Desmond Clark (1959), it is dominated by finger-painted geometric motifs and designs, thought to extend back many thousands of years.

      Eastern Africa, from the Zambezi River Valley to Lake Turkana, consists largely of a vast inland plateau with the highest elevations on the continent, such as Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m above sea level) and Mount Kenya (5,199 m above sea level). Twin parallel rift valleys run through the region, which includes the world’s second largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria. The climate is atypical of an equatorial region, being cool and dry due to the high altitude and monsoon winds created by the Ethiopian Highlands. The rock art of eastern Africa is concentrated on this plateau and consists mainly of paintings that include animal and human representations. Found mostly in central Tanzania, eastern Zambia and Malawi; in comparison to the widespread distribution of geometric rock art, this figurative tradition is much more localised, and found at just a few hundred sites in a region of less than 100km in diameter.

    body: |-
      The rock art of East Africa, in particular the red paintings from Tanzania, was extensively studied by Mary and Louis Leakey in the 1930s and 1950s. Eric Ten Raa observed Sandawe people of Tanzania making rock paintings in the mid-20th century, and on the basis of oral traditions argued that the rock art was made for three main purposes: casual art; magic art (for hunting purposes or connected to health and fertility) and sacrificial art (to appease ancestral spirits). Subsequently, during the 1970s Fidelis Masao and Emmanuel Anati recorded numerous sites, classifying the art in broad chronological and stylistic categories, proposing tentative interpretations with regard to meaning.

      There has much debate and uncertainty about Central African rock art.  The history of the region has seen much mobility and interaction of cultural groups and understanding how the rock art relates to particular groups has been problematic. Pioneering work in this region was undertaken by Margaret Metcalfe in central Malawi in the early 1920s, Clarence van Riet Lowe visited Zambia in 1936 and attempted to provide a chronological sequence and some insight into the meaning of the rock art. Since the 1950s (Clarke, 1959), archaeologists have attempted to situate rock art within broader archaeological frameworks in order to resolve chronologies, and to categorise the art with reference to style, colour, superimposition, subject matter, weathering, and positioning of depictions within the panel (Phillipson, 1976). Building on this work, our current understanding of rock in this region has been advanced by Benjamin Smith (1995, 1997, 2001) with his work in Zambia and Malawi.

    body: "Rock art of East Africa consists mainly of paintings, most of which are
      found in central Tanzania, and are fewer in number in eastern Zambia and Malawi;
      scholars have categorised them as follows:\n\n*__Red Paintings__*:  \nRed paintings
      can be sub-divided into those found in central Tanzania and those found stretching
      from Zambia to the Indian Ocean.\nTanzanian red paintings include large, naturalistic
      animals with occasional geometric motifs. The giraffe is the most frequently
      painted animal, but antelope, zebra, elephant, rhino, felines and ostrich are
      also depicted. Later images show figures with highly distinctive stylised human
      head forms or hairstyles and body decoration, sometimes in apparent hunting
      and domestic scenes. The Sandawe and Hadza, hunter-gatherer groups, indigenous
      to north-central and central Tanzania respectively, claim their ancestors were
      responsible for some of the later art.\n\nThe area in which Sandawe rock art
      is found is less than 100km in diameter and occurs at just a few hundred sites,
      but corresponds closely to the known distribution of this group. There have
      been some suggestions that Sandawe were making rock art early into the 20th
      century, linking the art to particular rituals, in particular simbo; a trance
      dance in which the Sandawe communicate with the spirit world by taking on the
      power of an animal. The art displays a range of motifs and postures, features
      that can be understood by reference to simbo and to trance experiences; such
      as groups of human figures bending at the waist (which occurs during the *simbo*
      dance), taking on animal features such as ears and tails, and floating or flying;
      reflecting the experiences of those possessed in the dance."

    body: "Zambian rock art does not share any similarities with Tanzanian rock art
      and can be divided into two categories; animals (with a few depictions of humans),
      and geometric motifs. Animals are often highly stylised and superimposed with
      rows of dots. Geometric designs include, circles, some of which have radiating
      lines, concentric circles, parallel lines and ladder shapes. Predominantly painted
      in red, the remains of white pigment is still often visible. David Phillipson
      (1976) proposed that the naturalistic animals were earlier in date than geometric
      designs. Building on Phillipson’s work, Benjamin Smith studied ethnographic
      records and demonstrated that geometric motifs were made by women or controlling
      the weather.\n\n*__Pastoralist paintings__*: \nPastoralist paintings are rare,
      with only a few known sites in Kenya and other possible sites in Malawi. Usually
      painted in black, white and grey, but also in other colours, they include small
      outlines, often infilled, of cattle and are occasional accompanied by geometric
      motifs. Made during the period from 3,200 to 1,800 years ago the practice ceased
      after Bantu language speaking people had settled in eastern Africa. Similar
      paintings are found in Ethiopia but not in southern Africa, and it has been
      assumed that these were made by Cushitic or Nilotic speaking groups, but their
      precise attribution remains unclear (Smith, 2013:154).\n"

      *__Late White Paintings__*:
      Commonly painted in white, or off-white with the fingers, so-called ‘Late White’ depictions include quite large crudely rendered representations of wild animals, mythical animals, human figures and numerous geometric motifs. These paintings are attributed to Bantu language speaking, iron-working farmers who entered eastern Africa about 2,000 years ago from the west on the border of Nigeria and Cameroon. Moving through areas occupied by the Batwa it is thought they learned the use of symbols painted on rock, skin, bark cloth and in sand. Chewa peoples, Bantu language speakers who live in modern day Zambia and Malawi claim their ancestors made many of the more recent paintings which they used in rites of passage ceremonies.

      *__Meat-feasting paintings__*:
      Meat-feasting shelters exist from northern Tanzania through Kenya to Lake Turkana, and are places where Maa-speaking initiated men, who are not permitted to eat meat in their homes, gather to kill and feast on animals, predominantly cattle. The term Maa relates to a group of closely related Eastern Nilotic languages, which historically dominated the east African hinterland; and today is spoken by around a million people. During or after feasting, symbols of the animals that had been eaten were painted on the shelter ceiling in white or less often red. Maa speakers brand their cattle and camels with symbols that signify the lineage of their owners, but may also indicate if an animal has been treated for a particular disease. Different symbols may be used for male and female animals. Over the centuries, because the depictions are on the ceiling of meat feasting rock shelters, and because sites are used even today, a build-up of soot has obscured or obliterated the paintings. Unfortunately, few have been recorded or mapped.

    title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 7'
    body: The rock art of central Africa is attributed to hunter-gatherers known as
      Batwa. This term is used widely in eastern central and southern Africa to denote
      any autochthonous hunter-gatherer people. The rock art of the Batwa can be divided
      into two categories which are quite distinctive stylistically from the Tanzanian
      depictions of the Sandawe and Hadza. Nearly 3,000 sites are currently known
      from within this area. The vast majority, around 90%, consist of finger-painted
      geometric designs; the remaining 10% include highly stylised animal forms (with
      a few human figures) and rows of finger dots. Both types are thought to date
      back many thousands of years. The two traditions co-occur over a vast area of
      eastern and central Africa and while often found in close proximity to each
      other are only found together at a few sites. However, it is the dominance of
      geometric motifs that make this rock art tradition very distinctive from other
      regions in Africa.

    title: Rock art in the Horn of Africa
    title_internal: 'East Africa: regional, chapter 10'
    body: "The Horn of Africa has historically been a crossroads area between the
      Eastern Sahara, the Subtropical regions to the South and the Arabic Peninsula.
      These mixed influences can be seen in many archaeological and historical features
      throughout the region, the rock art being no exception. Since the early stages
      of research in the 1930s, a strong relationship between the rock art in Ethiopia
      and the Arabian Peninsula was detected, leading to the establishment of the
      term *Ethiopian-Arabian* rock art by Pavel Červiček in 1971. This research thread
      proposes a progressive evolution from naturalism to schematism, ranging from
      the 4th-3rd millennium BC to the near past. Although the *Ethiopian-Arabian*
      proposal is still widely accepted and stylistic similarities between the rock
      art of Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen or Saudi Arabia are undeniable, recent voices
      have been raised against the term because of its excessive generalisation and
      lack of operability. In addition, recent research to the south of Ethiopia have
      started to discover new rock art sites related to those found in Uganda and
      Kenya.\n\nRegarding the main themes of the Horn of Africa rock art, cattle depictions
      seem to have been paramount, with cows and bulls depicted either isolated or
      in herds, frequently associated with ritual scenes which show their importance
      in these communities. Other animals – zebus, camels, felines, dogs, etc. –  are
      also represented, as well as rows of human figures, and fighting scenes between
      warriors or against lions. Geometric symbols are also common, usually associated
      with other depictions; and in some places they have been interpreted as tribal
      or clan marks. Both engraving and painting is common in most regions, with many
      regional variations. \n"

      Rock art in the Horn of Africa faces several challenges. One of them is the lack of consolidated chronologies and absolute dating for the paintings and engravings. Another is the uneven knowledge of rock art throughout the region, with research often affected by political unrest. Therefore, distributions of rock art in the region are steadily growing as research is undertaken in one of the most interactive areas in East Africa.

      The rock art of Central and East Africa is one of the least documented and well understood of the corpus of African rock art. However, in recent years scholars have undertaken some comprehensive reviews of existing sites and surveys of new sites to open up the debates and more fully understand the complexities of this region.

      Atlantic Ocean. Although it is considered a distinct entity, it is composed
      of a variety of geographical regions and environments, including sand seas,
      hammadas (stone deserts), seasonal watercourses, oases, mountain ranges and
      rocky plains. Rock art is found throughout this area, principally in the desert

      of Adrar in Mauritania and Adrar des Ifoghas in Mali, the Atlas Mountains of
      Morocco and Algeria, the Tassili n’Ajjer and Ahaggar Mountains in Algeria, the
      mountainous areas of Tadrart Acacus and Messak in Libya, the Aïr Mountains of

    title: Types of rock art and distribution
    title_internal: 'North Africa: regional, chapter 2'
    body: |+
      Although the styles and subjects of north African rock art vary, there are commonalities: images are most often figurative and frequently depict animals, both wild and domestic. There are also many images of human figures, sometimes with accessories such as recognisable weaponry or clothing. These may be painted or engraved, with frequent occurrences of both, at times in the same context. Engravings are generally more common, although this may simply be a preservation bias due to their greater durability.

      The physical context of rock art sites varies depending on geographical and topographical factors – for example, Moroccan rock engravings are often found on open rocky outcrops, while Tunisia’s Djebibina rock art sites have all been found in rock shelters. Rock art in the vast and harsh environments of the Sahara is often inaccessible and hard to find, and there is probably a great deal of rock art that is yet to be seen by archaeologists; what is known has mostly been documented within the last century.

    body: Although the existence of rock art throughout the Sahara was known to local
      communities, it was not until the nineteenth century that it became known to
      Europeans, thanks to explorers such as Heinrich Barth, who crossed the Messak
      Plateau in Libya in 1850, first noting the existence of engravings. Further
      explorations in the early twentieth century by celebrated travellers, ethnographers
      and archaeologists such as Hassanein Bey, Abbé Breuil, László Almásy, Henri
      Lhote and Leo Frobenius brought the rock art of Sahara, and northern Africa
      in general, to the awareness of a European public.

    title: Attribution and dating
    title_internal: 'North Africa: regional, chapter 3'
    body: 'The investigations of these researchers and those who have followed them
      have sought to date and attribute these artworks, with varying measures of success.
      Rock art may be associated with certain cultures through known parallels with
      the imagery in other artefacts, such as Naqada Period designs in Egyptian rock
      art that mirror those on dateable pottery. Authorship may be also guessed at
      through corroborating evidence: for example, due to knowledge of their chariot
      use, and the location of rock art depicting chariots in the central Sahara,
      it has been suggested that it was produced by – or at the same time as – the
      height of the Garamantes culture, a historical ethnic group who formed a local
      power around what is now southern Libya from 500 BC–700 AD. However, opportunities
      to anchor rock art imagery in this way to known ancient cultures are few and
      far between, and rock art is generally ascribed to anonymous hunter-gatherers,
      nomadic peoples, or pastoralists, with occasional imagery-based comparisons
      made with contemporary groups, such as the Fulani peoples.'

      Occasionally, association with writing in the form of, for example, Libyan-Berber or Arabic graffiti can give a known dating margin, but in general, lack of contemporary writing and written sources (Herodotus wrote about the Garamantes) leaves much open to conjecture.

      Other forms of (rare) circumstantial evidence, such as rock art covered by a dateable stratigraphic layer, and (more common) stylistic image-based dating have been used instead to form a chronology of Saharan rock art periods that is widely agreed upon, although dates are contested. The first stage, known as the Early Hunter, Wild Fauna or Bubalus Period, is posited at about 12,000–6,000 years ago, and is typified by naturalistic engravings of wild animals, in particular an extinct form of buffalo identifiable by its long horns.

    body: A possibly concurrent phase is known as the Round Head Period (about 10,000
      to 8,000 years ago) due to the large discoid heads of the painted human figures.
      Following this is the most widespread style, the Pastoral Period (around 7,500
      to 4,000 years ago), which is characterised by numerous paintings and engravings
      of cows, as well as occasional hunting scenes. The Horse Period (around 3,000
      to 2,000 years ago) features recognisable horses and chariots and the final
      Camel Period (around 2,000 years ago to present) features domestic dromedary
      camels, which we know to have been widely used across the Sahara from that time.

      that the area – and the time period in which rock art was produced – is extensive
      and there is significant temporal and spatial variability within and across
      sites. There are some commonalities in rock art styles and themes across the
      Sahara, but there are also regional variations and idiosyncrasies, and a lack
      of evidence that any of these were directly, or even indirectly, related. The
      engravings of weaponry motifs from Morocco and the painted ‘swimming’ figures
      of the Gilf Kebir Plateau in Egypt and Sudan are not only completely different,
      but unique to their areas. Being thousands of kilometres apart and so different
      in style and composition, they serve to illustrate the limitations inherent
      in examining northern African rock art as a unit. The contemporary political
      and environmental challenges to accessing rock art sites in countries across
      the Sahara serves as another limiting factor in their study, but as dating techniques
      improve and further discoveries are made, this is a field with the potential
      to help illuminate much of the prehistory of northern Africa.\n\n"

      The southern African countries of Zimbabwe, South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, Botswana and Namibia contain thousands of rock art sites and southern African rock art has been studied extensively.  Due to perceived similarities in subject matter, even across great distances, much southern African rock art has been ascribed to hunter-gatherer painters and engravers who appear to have had a shared set of cultural references.  These have been linked with beliefs and practices which remain common to modern San|Bushman¹ people, a number of traditional hunter-gatherer groups who continue to live in Southern Africa, principally in Namibia, Botswana and South Africa.  There are, however, differences in style and technique between regions, and various rock art traditions are attributed to other cultural groups and their ancestors.  As is often the case with rock art, the accurate attribution of authorship, date and motivation is difficult to establish, but the rock art of this region continues to be studied and the richness of the material in terms of subject matter, as well as in the context of the archaeological record, has much to tell us, both about its own provenance and the lives of the people who produced it.

    body: 'There is wide variation in the physical environments of southern Africa,
      ranging from the rainforests of Mozambique to the arid Namib Desert of western
      Namibia, with the climate tending to become drier towards the south and west.  The
      central southern African plateau is divided by the central dip of the Kalahari
      basin, and bordered by the Great Escarpment, a sharp drop in altitude towards
      the coast which forms a ridge framing much of southern Africa.  The escarpment
      runs in a rough inland parallel to the coastline, from northern Angola, south
      around the Cape and up in the east to the border between Zimbabwe and Malawi.  Both
      painted and engraved rock art is found throughout southern Africa, with the
      type and distribution partially informed by the geographical characteristics
      of the different regions.  Inland areas with exposed boulders, flat rock ‘pavements’
      and rocky outcrops tend to feature engraved rock art, whereas paintings are
      more commonly found in the protective rock shelters of mountainous or hilly
      areas, often in ranges edging the Great Escarpment.  '

    title: Types of rock art
    title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 4'
    body: "Rock art of the type associated with hunter-gatherers is perhaps the most
      widely distributed rock art tradition in southern Africa, with numerous known
      examples in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe, but also with examples found
      in Botswana and Mozambique. This tradition comprises paintings and engravings,
      with both techniques featuring images of animals and people.  The type and composition
      varies from region to region.  For example, rock art sites of the southern Drakensberg
      and Maloti mountains in South Africa and Lesotho contain a higher proportion
      of images of eland antelope, while those in Namibia in turn feature more giraffes.
      \ There are also regional variations in style and colour: in some sites and
      areas paintings are polychrome (multi-coloured) while in others they are not.\n\nDifferences
      also occur in composition between painting and engraving sites, with paintings
      more likely to feature multiple images on a single surface, often interacting
      with one another, while engraving sites more often include isolated images on
      individual rocks and boulders.  However, there are commonalities in both imagery
      and style, with paintings throughout southern Africa often including depictions
      of people, particularly in procession and carrying items such as bows and arrows.
      \ Also heavily featured in both paintings and engravings are animals, in particular
      large ungulates which are often naturalistically depicted, sometimes in great
      detail.  Additionally, images may include people and animals which appear to
      have the features of several species and are harder to identify.  Some hunter-gatherer
      type paintings are described as ‘fine-line’ paintings because of the delicacy
      of their rendering with a thin brush.  \n"

    body: "Hunter-gatherer rock paintings are found in particular concentrations in
      the Drakensberg-Maloti and Cape Fold Mountains in South Africa and Lesotho,
      the Brandberg and Erongo Mountains in Namibia and the Matobo Hills in Zimbabwe,
      while engraving sites are found throughout the interior, often near water courses.
      \n\nA different form of rock painting from the hunter-gatherer type, found mainly
      in the north-eastern portion of southern Africa is that of the ‘late whites’.
      \ Paintings in this tradition are so-called because they are usually associated
      with Bantu language-speaking Iron Age farming communities who entered the area
      from the north from around 2,000 years ago and many of these images are thought
      to have been painted later than some of the older hunter-gatherer paintings.
      ‘Late white’ paintings take many forms, but have generally been applied with
      a finger rather than a brush, and as the name suggests, are largely white in
      colour.  These images represent animals, people and geometric shapes, often
      in quite schematic forms, in contrast to the generally more naturalistic depictions
      of the hunter-gatherer art.  \n\nSometimes ‘late white’ art images relate to
      dateable events or depict objects and scenes which could only have taken place
      following European settlement, such as trains.  Other forms of southern African
      rock art also depict European people and objects.  These include images from
      the Western Cape in South Africa of a sailing ship, estimated to date from after
      the mid-17th century, as well as painted and engraved imagery from throughout
      South Africa showing people on horseback with firearms. Such images are sometimes
      termed ‘contact art’ as their subject matter demonstrates that they follow the
      period of first contact between European and indigenous people.   \n"

    title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 6'
    body: 'The first known reports of African rock art outside of the continent appear
      to come from the Bishop of Mozambique, who in 1721 reported sightings of paintings
      on rocks to the Royal Academy of History in Lisbon. Following this, reports,
      copies and publications of rock art from throughout modern South Africa were
      made with increasing frequency by officials and explorers. From the mid-19th
      century onwards, rock art from present-day Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana began
      to be documented, and during the first few decades of the twentieth century
      global public interest in the art was piqued by a series of illustrated publications.
      The hunter-gatherer rock art in particular had a strong aesthetic and academic
      appeal to western audiences, and reports, photographs and copied images attracted
      the attention of prominent figures in archaeology and ethnology such as Miles
      Burkitt, Leo Frobenius and the Abbé Breuil, researchers whose interest in rock
      art worldwide let them to visit and write about southern African rock art sites.  A
      further intensification of archaeological and anthropological research and recording
      in the 1950s-70s, resulted in new insights into the interpretations and attributions
      for southern African rock art. Rock art research continues throughout the area

    title: Interpretation
    title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 7'
    body: Rather than showing scenes from daily life, as was once assumed, it is now
      usually accepted that hunter-gatherer art in southern Africa shows images and
      motifs of spiritual and cultural importance. In particular, it is thought that
      some images reflect trance visions of San|Bushman spiritual leaders, or shamans,  during
      which they are considered to enter the world of spirits, where they are held
      to perform tasks for themselves and their communities, such as healing the sick
      or encouraging rain. This interpretation, which has been widely accepted, explains
      certain features of the art, for example the predominance of certain animals
      like eland antelope (due to their special cultural significance) and themes
      such as dot patterns and zigzag lines (interpreted as geometric patterns that
      shamans may see upon entering a trance state).

    body: "The rock art attributed to ancestral San|Bushman hunter-gatherers has many
      varied motifs, some of which may also relate to specific themes such as initiation
      or rainmaking (indeed within its cultural context one image may have several
      significances).  San|Bushman informants in the 19th century told researchers
      that certain ambiguously shaped animals in the rock art repertoire represented
      animals related to water.  Images such as these are known to researchers as
      'rain animals' and it has been suggested that certain images could reflect—or
      prompt—the shaman's attempt to control rainfall. Some 'late white' art has also
      been proposed to have associations with rainmaking practices, and indeed the
      proximity of some geometric rock art images, proposed to be of possible Khoekhoen
      origin, to watercourses appears to emphasise the practical and spiritual significance
      of water among historical southern African communities. It has also been proposed
      that some forms of geometric art attributed to Khoekhoen people may be linked
      by tradition and motif to the schematic art traditions of central Africa, themselves
      attributed to hunter-gatherers and possibly made in connection with beliefs
      about water and fertility.  Much in the “late white” corpus of paintings appears
      to be connected to initiation practices, part of a larger set of connected traditions
      extending north as far as Kenya.   \n\nThe long time periods, cultural connections,
      and movements involved can make attribution difficult.  For example, the idiosyncratic
      rock paintings of Tsodilo Hills in Botswana which appear to have similarities
      with the hunter-gatherer style include images of domesticates and may have been
      the work of herders.  More localised traditions, such as that of engravings
      in north-western South Africa representing the homesteads of ancestral Nguni
      or Sotho-Tswana language speakers, or the focus on engravings of animal tracks
      found in Namibia, demonstrate more specific regional significances.  Research
      continues and in recent decades, researchers, focusing on studying individual
      sites and sets of sites within the landscape and the local historical context,
      have discussed how their placement and subject matter may reflect the shifting
      balances of power, and changes in their communities over time.  \n"

    title: Dating
    title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 9'
    body: "Although dating rock art is always difficult, the study of rock art sites
      from southern Africa has benefitted from archaeological study and excavations
      at rock art sites have sometimes revealed useful information for ascribing dates.
      \ Some of the oldest reliably dated examples of rock art in the world have been
      found in the region, with the most well-known examples probably being the painted
      plaques from Apollo 11 Cave in Namibia, dated to around 30,000 years ago.  A
      portion of an engraved animal found in South Africa’s Northern Cape is estimated
      to be 10,200 years old and painted spalls from shelter walls in Zimbabwe have
      been dated to 12,000 years ago or older.  However, it is thought that the majority
      of existing rock art was made more recently.  As ever, subject matter is also
      helpful in ascribing maximum date ranges.  We know, for example,that images
      of domestic animals are probably less than 2,000 years old.  The condition of
      the art may also help to establish relative ages, particularly with regards
      to engravings, which may be in some cases be categorised by the discolouration
      of the patina that darkens them over time.   \n\nThe multiplicity of rock art
      sites throughout southern Africa form a major component of southern Africa’s
      archaeological record, with many interesting clues about the lives of past inhabitants
      and, in some cases, continuing religious and cultural importance for contemporary
      communities.  Many sites are open to the public, affording visitors the unique
      experience of viewing rock art in situ.  Unfortunately, the exposed nature of
      rock art in the field leaves it open to potential damage from the environment
      and vandalism.  Many  major rock art sites in southern Africa are protected
      by law in their respective countries and the Maloti-Drakensberg Park in South
      Africa and Lesotho, Twyfelfontein/ǀUi-ǁAis in Namibia, Tsodilo Hills in Botswana
      and the Matobo Hills in Zimbabwe are all inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage
      list. \n"

    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'General: how made, chapter 1'
    body: 'Rock art has been practised for tens of thousands of years and the techniques
      by which the paintings and engravings are created, while varied, conform to
      basic principles related to resources and technology. An equally important factor
      is where the image is placed. Not every rock surface is appropriate to inscribe,
      some may need preparing beforehand. While much research focus is generally given
      over to subject matter, dating and meaning in rock art studies, consideration
      of the techniques of production can provide some insightful observations into
      the methodologies by which images are created. Technically speaking, images
      can be broadly classified into two main groups: petroglyphs and pictographs.
      Petroglyphs are engraved or carved depictions on a rock surface; pictographs
      are painted images on a rock surface.'

    title: Pictographs - Painting
    title_internal: 'General: how made, chapter 2'
    body: The pigments used in paintings are dependent on local resources, but typically
      have been made of minerals such as ochre that comes in a variety of red, brown
      and yellow hues. White is derived from silica, china clay and gypsum and black
      is obtained from manganese minerals, charcoal or specularite. Once collected
      these minerals were ground to form a powder and mixed with liquids such as egg
      albumen, urine, blood, saliva or water to make the pigment easier to apply and
      to act as a binding agent. Current research is exploring new methods to be able
      to date these ingredients. A variety of tools have been used to apply the pigment
      onto rock surfaces including birds’ feathers, animal hair, grasses or reeds
      and fingers. This process is not simply a technological one, and for many cultural
      groups the pigment itself and the method of application are imbued with symbolic
      meaning.

    body: A very specific type of image is the handprint. These can be made in two
      ways, positively and negatively; by covering the hand in paint and applying
      it to the rock surface or by placing the hand on the rock and blowing paint
      through a tube or from the mouth over the hand to produce a stencil effect.
      Most images were made just in one colour, although examples of bichrome or polychrome
      are relatively frequent. Again, although very rare, there are some examples
      of figures combining engraving and painting.

    title: Petroglyphs – Engraving
    title_internal: 'General: how made, chapter 4'
    body: Three techniques were generally used to remove the rock surface; incising/engraving
      (lines are cut into the rock with a sharp tool); pecking (hammering and chipping
      away at the rock surface) and scraping. Rock faces were sometimes ‘prepared’
      by scraping, allowing for an improved surface on which to inscribe the image.
      Incising or engraving involves scratching into the stone surface using a sharp
      lithic flake or metal blade. Pecking is a form of indirect percussion whereby
      a second rock is used like a chisel between the hammerstone and the rock face,
      while scraping is created using a hard hammerstone, which is battered against
      the rock surface. A last, much rarer method of engraving is the bas-relief technique,
      where the area around the image is lowered (usually by polishing) thus making
      the figure raise over the surface.

    body: These methods of engraving are sometimes combined, as happens in the Sahara
      where the outline of pecked figures is polished afterwards. Although for the
      most part the engravings just depict the figures’ contour, on other occasions
      all or part of the image is infilled with pecking or polishing. In all these
      techniques, after differing periods of time the engraved surfaces weather and
      acquire the same darker patina as the original surface.

    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'General: chronologies, chapter 1'
    body: The axiom that rock art is notoriously difficult to date serves only to
      paint a partial picture of the inconsistent and contested chronological records
      of rock art in Africa. For example, where research has focused on interpretation,
      chronology has been less prominent and as such the capacity for judging meaningful
      relationships between sites and imagery has been inhibited; by contrast where
      chronologies have led research agendas, the temporal and spatial relationships
      are much clearer, but chronologies are hotly disputed. A significant obstacle
      is the challenge in directly dating rock art, and current research is exploring
      ways forward in refining these techniques. Here, we give an overview of dating
      methods and developed chronologies to date in rock art regions across the continent.

    title: Relative Dating
    title_internal: 'General: chronologies, chapter 3'
    body: |-
      Relative chronologies aim to organise the images from the oldest to the more recent, even if their exact dates are not known, providing the relative position of groups of depictions over time. It uses methods such as the analysis of superimpositions (the figures on the top have to be younger than those underneath), the study of depictions of animals already extinct or newly introduced in areas (for example, camels in the Sahara) or objects that have a known timeframe of usage, such as ships, firearms, chariots, etc.

      In some cases, graffiti can be found alongside figures, and linguistic studies can help to determine the age of both texts and depictions. Of course, one of the best ways to establish a relative date for rock art is when it is covered by archaeological deposits that can be dated through radiocarbon methods or archaeological materials. However, that date only states the minimum age of the rock art depictions, as they could have been covered hundreds or thousands of years after the images were painted or engraved. Moreover, these situations are very rare, as most of the time rock art is situated in the open air, without associated archaeological sites.

    title: Absolute Dating
    title_internal: 'General: chronologies, chapter 4'
    body: The second type of dating is called absolute dating and provides concrete
      dates (or more often, intervals of age) in which the images were made. Although
      this could seem the perfect solution for the dating of paintings, the methods
      of absolute dating can only be used in very specific contexts, and often have
      serious problems of accuracy and reliability. The most efficient is based on
      the radiocarbon (carbon-14) method, measuring the amount of carbon remaining
      in pigments, although in many depictions the remnants of paint are so sparse
      that the size of the samples is too low to be measured. Besides, this method
      is destructive, as part of the painting has to be removed from the original
      site to collect the sample.

    title: Dating engravings
    title_internal: 'General: chronologies, chapter 5'
    body: 'The study of engravings is even more difficult, as it is based on the changes
      that affect their surface after they were made. The most obvious is a progressive
      change in colour, making the older engravings seems “darker” than the newer.
      When the changes in colour are due to chemical, internal processes, the term
      used is *patina*, while when they are caused by the accumulation of particles
      the process is known as *varnishing*. Finally, the progressive weathering of
      the engraving’s traces can also be measured. By studying the pace of these natural
      processes, scientists can propose dates for the engravings. However, as with
      carbon-14, these methods have several problems that affect their suitability:
      the study of these natural processes is slow and costly, and the results can
      only be applied to small, concrete areas. There are also problems with the accuracy
      of the measurements, and risks of contamination of samples are high. Therefore,
      although they are promising, the absolute dating methods are still far from
      providing generalized and relatively easy ways to reliably date rock art.'

      __Stylistic dating__

      The importance of dating has been at the forefront of much research in North African rock art, yet there is no consensus of opinion about the precise dating of the phases of rock art in this region. The construction of rock art sequences has been predicated on stylistic analysis, on which most scholars agree in principle, and broadly conforms to the following:


      - *Early Hunter*, *Wild Fauna* Period or *Bubalus* Period: 12,000 – 8,000 years ago
      - *Round Head* Period: 10,000 – 8,000 years ago
      - *Pastoral* Period: 7,500 – 4,000 years ago
      - *Horse* Period: 3,000 – 2,000 years ago
      - *Camel* Period: 2,000 years ago – present

      For the most part, there is general agreement on the dating of the Horse and Camel period, but the earliest phases of rock art - the *Bubalus*/*Round Head*/*Pastoral* periods, are much more contentious. Researchers Henri Lhote and Alfredo Muzzolini have argued that the *Pastoral* period begins around 6,000 years ago, while others, such as Fabrizio Mori, propose an earlier date of 8,000 years ago. Domestic stock is thought to have existed in the Sahara from around 7,500 years ago, making a date of 8,000 years old for paintings of cattle (which may have been wild) feasible. Dating the end of this period is just as problematic, with Lhote and Mori placing it between 3,000-4,000 years ago and Muzzolini about 1,000 years later. However, the largest discrepancy relates to the *Bubalus* and *Round Head* periods, where significantly disparate chronologies have been proposed by Lhote, Mori and Muzzolini. The most extreme of these is the *Bubalus* period, where Mori advocates an Early/Long chronology proposing that the earliest images date back 12,000 years, while Muzzolini suggests a Recent/Short chronology proposing a much later emergence of art in the region at 6,000 years ago.

      The application of direct dating will be central in resolving these substantial differences and has yielded some fruitful results on archaeological sites in making meaningful correlations. However, for the time being, the chronologies of Saharan rock art remain ambiguous and contested.

    body: Although a vast amount of work has been undertaken in rock art research
      in southern Africa, the focus has been largely placed on the meaning of images
      and their place within a rich ethnographic record. Little attention has been

      is a conspicuous absence of secure regional chronologies for southern African

      __Relative dating__

      Based on observations in the field, relative sequences were proposed by Patricia Vinnicombe (1976) for the southern region of the Drakensberg and by Revell Mason (1933) and Harald Pager (1971) for the northern region. Subsequently, several sites in South Africa have been analysed using a method termed the Harris Matrix. In its original context the Harris Matrix was a diagrammatic tool used in archaeological fieldwork to determine the temporal succession of deposits and stratigraphic relationships. Its use in South African rock art has been limited and often on isolated sites, and one of the drawbacks in this methodology is the lack of information on time lapses between successive images. While a few radiocarbon and Accelerator Mass Spectometry (AMS) dates have been secured for some sites, the absolute dates need to be matched with relative chronologies, which to date are still not firmly established.

      __Stylistic dating__

      Much rock art research has focused on the San rock paintings found in southern Africa (Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe). The subject matter of San rock art is extremely varied but regional characteristics can be seen; for example, depictions of eland dominate much of the rock art in South Africa, while kudu and elephants prevail in Zimbabwe. The earliest San art is thought to be up to 10,000 years old and continues possibly well into the twentieth century in the Drakensberg mountains.

      The spread of farming to South Africa by Bantu-language speakers around 3,500 years ago brought another style of rock art, until it ceased around the mid-1900s. The art is predominantly in white, and applied using fingers, which gives it a rough appearance. Subject matter is varied but dominated by humans and animals. Later rock art reflected contact with European settlers/colonisers, attested to by the numerous depictions of steam trains, soldiers, settlers and guns.

    title_internal: 'General: chronologies, chapter 10'
    body: |-
      __Absolute/Relative dating__

      Little research has been conducted, either on absolute or relative rock art chronologies in central Africa, and is therefore still poorly understood by comparison with northern and southern Africa. Promising recent radiocarbon dates have been reported from paintings in Angola, but the absence of contextual information with these dates renders them unproductive. Dating rock art by association with archaeological deposits has not proved entirely successful either. Relative chronologies have been suggested, and while there are regional variations, in general two styles of rock art have been identified and associated with a relative chronology: Twa and Sandawe.

      __Stylistic dating__

      Twa-style art dates to around 3,000 to 1,000 years ago and was made by hunter-gatherer groups in eastern and central Africa. Depictions of animals are rare in Twa art and usually consist of geometric designs, often concentric circles. Ancestral Sandawe art, found mainly in central Tanzania, is thought to date from around 9,000 years ago to the recent past, and includes fairly large naturalistic images of animals in both hunting and domestic scenes. Figures are frequently holding bows and arrows, and are often depicted with elaborate hairstyles and/or headdresses.

      in charcoal, ochre and white, were located in a Middle Stone Age deposit. These
      images are not easily identifiable to species level, but have been interpreted
      variously as felines and/or bovids; one in particular has been observed to be
      either a zebra, giraffe or ostrich, demonstrating the ambiguous nature of the
      depictions.

    title: Art and our modern mind
    title_internal: 'General: origins, chapter 3'
    body: |-
      While the Apollo 11 plaques may be the oldest discovered representational art in Africa, this is not the beginning of the story of art. It is now well-established, through genetic and fossil evidence, that anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) developed in Africa more than 100,000 years ago; of these, a small group left the Continent around 60,000-80,000 years ago and spread throughout the rest of the world. Recently discovered examples of patterned stone, ochre and ostrich eggshell, as well as evidence of personal ornamentation emerging from Middle Stone Age Africa (100,000–60,000 years ago), have demonstrated that ‘art’ is not only a much older phenomenon than previously thought, but that it has its roots in the African continent. Africa is where we share a common humanity.

      The first examples of what we might term ‘art’ in Africa, dating from between 100,000–60,000 years ago, emerge in two very distinct forms: personal adornment in the form of perforated seashells suspended on twine, and incised and engraved stone, ochre and ostrich eggshell. Despite some sites being 8,000km and 40,000 years apart, an intriguing feature of the earliest art is that these first forays appear remarkably similar. It is worth noting here that the term ‘art’ in this context is highly problematic, in that we cannot assume that humans living 100,000 years ago, or even 10,000 years ago, had a concept of art in the same way that we do, particularly in the modern Western sense. However, it remains a useful umbrella term for our purposes here.

    title: Pattern and design
    title_internal: 'General: origins, chapter 4'
    body: |-
      The practice of engraving or incising, which emerges around 12,000 years ago in Saharan rock art, has its antecedents much earlier, up to 100,000 years ago. Incised and engraved stone, bone, ochre and ostrich eggshell have been found at sites in southern Africa. These marked objects share features in the expression of design, exhibiting patterns that have been classified as cross-hatching.

      One of the most iconic and well-publicised sites that have yielded cross-hatch incised patterning on ochre is Blombos Cave, on the southern Cape shore of South Africa. Of the more than 8,500 fragments of ochre deriving from the MSA levels, 15 fragments show evidence of engraving. Two of these, dated to 77,000 years ago, have received the most attention for the design of cross-hatch pattern.

      For many archaeologists, the incised pieces of ochre at Blombos are the most complex and best-formed evidence for early abstract representations, and are unequivocal evidence for symbolic thought and language. The debate about when we became a symbolic species and acquired fully syntactical language – what archaeologists term ‘modern human behaviour’ – is both complex and contested. It has been proposed that these cross-hatch patterns are clear evidence of thinking symbolically, because the motifs are not representational and as such are culturally constructed and arbitrary. Moreover, in order for the meaning of this motif to be conveyed to others, language is a prerequisite.

      The Blombos engravings are not isolated occurrences, since the presence of such designs occur at more than half a dozen other sites in South Africa, suggesting that this pattern is indeed important in some way, and not the result of idiosyncratic behaviour. It is worth noting, however, that for some scholars, the premise that the pattern is symbolic is not so certain. The patterns may indeed have a meaning, but it is how that meaning is associated, either by resemblance (iconic) or correlation (indexical), that is important for our understanding of human cognition.

    body: Personal ornamentation and engraved designs are the earliest evidence of
      art in Africa, and are inextricably tied up with the development of human cognition.
      For tens of thousands of years, there has been not only a capacity for, but
      a motivation to adorn and to inscribe, to make visual that which is important.
      The interesting and pertinent issue in the context of this project is that the
      rock art we are cataloguing, describing and researching comes from a tradition
      that goes far back into African prehistory. The techniques and subject matter
      resonate over the millennia.
