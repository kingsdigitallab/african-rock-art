      The southern African countries of Zimbabwe, South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, Botswana and Namibia contain thousands of rock art sites and southern African rock art has been studied extensively.  Due to perceived similarities in subject matter, even across great distances, much southern African rock art has been ascribed to hunter-gatherer painters and engravers who appear to have had a shared set of cultural references.  These have been linked with beliefs and practices which remain common to modern San&#124;Bushman¹ people, a number of traditional hunter-gatherer groups who continue to live in Southern Africa, principally in Namibia, Botswana and South Africa.  There are, however, differences in style and technique between regions, and various rock art traditions are attributed to other cultural groups and their ancestors.  As is often the case with rock art, the accurate attribution of authorship, date and motivation is difficult to establish, but the rock art of this region continues to be studied and the richness of the material in terms of subject matter, as well as in the context of the archaeological record, has much to tell us, both about its own provenance and the lives of the people who produced it.

    body: 'There is wide variation in the physical environments of southern Africa,
      ranging from the rainforests of Mozambique to the arid Namib Desert of western
      Namibia, with the climate tending to become drier towards the south and west.  The
      central southern African plateau is divided by the central dip of the Kalahari
      basin, and bordered by the Great Escarpment, a sharp drop in altitude towards
      the coast which forms a ridge framing much of southern Africa.  The escarpment
      runs in a rough inland parallel to the coastline, from northern Angola, south
      around the Cape and up in the east to the border between Zimbabwe and Malawi.  Both
      painted and engraved rock art is found throughout southern Africa, with the
      type and distribution partially informed by the geographical characteristics
      of the different regions.  Inland areas with exposed boulders, flat rock ‘pavements’
      and rocky outcrops tend to feature engraved rock art, whereas paintings are
      more commonly found in the protective rock shelters of mountainous or hilly
      areas, often in ranges edging the Great Escarpment.  '

    title: Types of rock art
    title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 4'
    body: "Rock art of the type associated with hunter-gatherers is perhaps the most
      widely distributed rock art tradition in southern Africa, with numerous known
      examples in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe, but also with examples found
      in Botswana and Mozambique. This tradition comprises paintings and engravings,
      with both techniques featuring images of animals and people.  The type and composition
      varies from region to region.  For example, rock art sites of the southern Drakensberg
      and Maloti mountains in South Africa and Lesotho contain a higher proportion
      of images of eland antelope, while those in Namibia in turn feature more giraffes.
      \ There are also regional variations in style and colour: in some sites and
      areas paintings are polychrome (multi-coloured) while in others they are not.\n\nDifferences
      also occur in composition between painting and engraving sites, with paintings
      more likely to feature multiple images on a single surface, often interacting
      with one another, while engraving sites more often include isolated images on
      individual rocks and boulders.  However, there are commonalities in both imagery
      and style, with paintings throughout southern Africa often including depictions
      of people, particularly in procession and carrying items such as bows and arrows.
      \ Also heavily featured in both paintings and engravings are animals, in particular
      large ungulates which are often naturalistically depicted, sometimes in great
      detail.  Additionally, images may include people and animals which appear to
      have the features of several species and are harder to identify.  Some hunter-gatherer
      type paintings are described as ‘fine-line’ paintings because of the delicacy
      of their rendering with a thin brush.  \n"

    body: "Hunter-gatherer rock paintings are found in particular concentrations in
      the Drakensberg-Maloti and Cape Fold Mountains in South Africa and Lesotho,
      the Brandberg and Erongo Mountains in Namibia and the Matobo Hills in Zimbabwe,
      while engraving sites are found throughout the interior, often near water courses.
      \n\nA different form of rock painting from the hunter-gatherer type, found mainly
      in the north-eastern portion of southern Africa is that of the ‘late whites’.
      \ Paintings in this tradition are so-called because they are usually associated
      with Bantu language-speaking Iron Age farming communities who entered the area
      from the north from around 2,000 years ago and many of these images are thought
      to have been painted later than some of the older hunter-gatherer paintings.
      ‘Late white’ paintings take many forms, but have generally been applied with
      a finger rather than a brush, and as the name suggests, are largely white in
      colour.  These images represent animals, people and geometric shapes, often
      in quite schematic forms, in contrast to the generally more naturalistic depictions
      of the hunter-gatherer art.  \n\nSometimes ‘late white’ art images relate to
      dateable events or depict objects and scenes which could only have taken place
      following European settlement, such as trains.  Other forms of southern African
      rock art also depict European people and objects.  These include images from
      the Western Cape in South Africa of a sailing ship, estimated to date from after
      the mid-17th century, as well as painted and engraved imagery from throughout
      South Africa showing people on horseback with firearms. Such images are sometimes
      termed ‘contact art’ as their subject matter demonstrates that they follow the
      period of first contact between European and indigenous people.   \n"

    body: 'The first known reports of African rock art outside of the continent appear
      to come from the Bishop of Mozambique, who in 1721 reported sightings of paintings
      on rocks to the Royal Academy of History in Lisbon. Following this, reports,
      copies and publications of rock art from throughout modern South Africa were
      made with increasing frequency by officials and explorers. From the mid-19th
      century onwards, rock art from present-day Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana began
      to be documented, and during the first few decades of the twentieth century
      global public interest in the art was piqued by a series of illustrated publications.
      The hunter-gatherer rock art in particular had a strong aesthetic and academic
      appeal to western audiences, and reports, photographs and copied images attracted
      the attention of prominent figures in archaeology and ethnology such as Miles
      Burkitt, Leo Frobenius and the Abbé Breuil, researchers whose interest in rock
      art worldwide let them to visit and write about southern African rock art sites.  A
      further intensification of archaeological and anthropological research and recording
      in the 1950s-70s, resulted in new insights into the interpretations and attributions
      for southern African rock art. Rock art research continues throughout the area

    title_internal: 'Southern Africa: regional, chapter 7'
    body: Rather than showing scenes from daily life, as was once assumed, it is now
      usually accepted that hunter-gatherer art in southern Africa shows images and
      motifs of spiritual and cultural importance. In particular, it is thought that
      some images reflect trance visions of San&#124;Bushman spiritual leaders, or
      shamans,  during which they are considered to enter the world of spirits, where
      they are held to perform tasks for themselves and their communities, such as
      healing the sick or encouraging rain. This interpretation, which has been widely
      accepted, explains certain features of the art, for example the predominance
      of certain animals like eland antelope (due to their special cultural significance)
      and themes such as dot patterns and zigzag lines (interpreted as geometric patterns
      that shamans may see upon entering a trance state).

    body: "The rock art attributed to ancestral San&#124;Bushman hunter-gatherers
      has many varied motifs, some of which may also relate to specific themes such
      as initiation or rainmaking (indeed within its cultural context one image may
      have several significances).  San&#124;Bushman informants in the 19th century
      told researchers that certain ambiguously shaped animals in the rock art repertoire
      represented animals related to water.  Images such as these are known to researchers
      as 'rain animals' and it has been suggested that certain images could reflect—or
      prompt—the shaman's attempt to control rainfall. Some 'late white' art has also
      been proposed to have associations with rainmaking practices, and indeed the
      proximity of some geometric rock art images, proposed to be of possible Khoekhoen
      origin, to watercourses appears to emphasise the practical and spiritual significance
      of water among historical southern African communities. It has also been proposed
      that some forms of geometric art attributed to Khoekhoen people may be linked
      by tradition and motif to the schematic art traditions of central Africa, themselves
      attributed to hunter-gatherers and possibly made in connection with beliefs
      about water and fertility.  Much in the “late white” corpus of paintings appears
      to be connected to initiation practices, part of a larger set of connected traditions
      extending north as far as Kenya.   \n\nThe long time periods, cultural connections,
      and movements involved can make attribution difficult.  For example, the idiosyncratic
      rock paintings of Tsodilo Hills in Botswana which appear to have similarities
      with the hunter-gatherer style include images of domesticates and may have been
      the work of herders.  More localised traditions, such as that of engravings
      in north-western South Africa representing the homesteads of ancestral Nguni
      or Sotho-Tswana language speakers, or the focus on engravings of animal tracks
      found in Namibia, demonstrate more specific regional significances.  Research
      continues and in recent decades, researchers, focusing on studying individual
      sites and sets of sites within the landscape and the local historical context,
      have discussed how their placement and subject matter may reflect the shifting
      balances of power, and changes in their communities over time.  \n"

    body: "Although dating rock art is always difficult, the study of rock art sites
      from southern Africa has benefitted from archaeological study and excavations
      at rock art sites have sometimes revealed useful information for ascribing dates.
      \ Some of the oldest reliably dated examples of rock art in the world have been
      found in the region, with the most well-known examples probably being the painted
      plaques from Apollo 11 Cave in Namibia, dated to around 30,000 years ago.  A
      portion of an engraved animal found in South Africa’s Northern Cape is estimated
      to be 10,200 years old and painted spalls from shelter walls in Zimbabwe have
      been dated to 12,000 years ago or older.  However, it is thought that the majority
      of existing rock art was made more recently.  As ever, subject matter is also
      helpful in ascribing maximum date ranges.  We know, for example,that images
      of domestic animals are probably less than 2,000 years old.  The condition of
      the art may also help to establish relative ages, particularly with regards
      to engravings, which may be in some cases be categorised by the discolouration
      of the patina that darkens them over time.   \n\nThe multiplicity of rock art
      sites throughout southern Africa form a major component of southern Africa’s
      archaeological record, with many interesting clues about the lives of past inhabitants
      and, in some cases, continuing religious and cultural importance for contemporary
      communities.  Many sites are open to the public, affording visitors the unique
      experience of viewing rock art in situ.  Unfortunately, the exposed nature of
      rock art in the field leaves it open to potential damage from the environment
      and vandalism.  Many  major rock art sites in southern Africa are protected
      by law in their respective countries and the Maloti-Drakensberg Park in South
      Africa and Lesotho, Twyfelfontein/ǀUi-ǁAis in Namibia, Tsodilo Hills in Botswana
      and the Matobo Hills in Zimbabwe are all inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage
      list. \n"

      hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages
