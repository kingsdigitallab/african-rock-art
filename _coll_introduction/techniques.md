    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'General: how made, chapter 1'
    body: 'Rock art has been practised for tens of thousands of years and the techniques
      by which the paintings and engravings are created, while varied, conform to
      basic principles related to resources and technology. An equally important factor
      is where the image is placed. Not every rock surface is appropriate to inscribe,
      some may need preparing beforehand. While much research focus is generally given
      over to subject matter, dating and meaning in rock art studies, consideration
      of the techniques of production can provide some insightful observations into
      the methodologies by which images are created. Technically speaking, images
      can be broadly classified into two main groups: petroglyphs and pictographs.
      Petroglyphs are engraved or carved depictions on a rock surface; pictographs
      are painted images on a rock surface.'

    title: Pictographs - Painting
    title_internal: 'General: how made, chapter 2'
    body: The pigments used in paintings are dependent on local resources, but typically
      have been made of minerals such as ochre that comes in a variety of red, brown
      and yellow hues. White is derived from silica, china clay and gypsum and black
      is obtained from manganese minerals, charcoal or specularite. Once collected
      these minerals were ground to form a powder and mixed with liquids such as egg
      albumen, urine, blood, saliva or water to make the pigment easier to apply and
      to act as a binding agent. Current research is exploring new methods to be able
      to date these ingredients. A variety of tools have been used to apply the pigment
      onto rock surfaces including birds’ feathers, animal hair, grasses or reeds
      and fingers. This process is not simply a technological one, and for many cultural
      groups the pigment itself and the method of application are imbued with symbolic
      meaning.

    title_internal: 'General: how made, chapter 3'
    body: A very specific type of image is the handprint. These can be made in two
      ways, positively and negatively; by covering the hand in paint and applying
      it to the rock surface or by placing the hand on the rock and blowing paint
      through a tube or from the mouth over the hand to produce a stencil effect.
      Most images were made just in one colour, although examples of bichrome or polychrome
      are relatively frequent. Again, although very rare, there are some examples
      of figures combining engraving and painting.

    title: Petroglyphs – Engraving
    title_internal: 'General: how made, chapter 4'
    body: Three techniques were generally used to remove the rock surface; incising/engraving
      (lines are cut into the rock with a sharp tool); pecking (hammering and chipping
      away at the rock surface) and scraping. Rock faces were sometimes ‘prepared’
      by scraping, allowing for an improved surface on which to inscribe the image.
      Incising or engraving involves scratching into the stone surface using a sharp
      lithic flake or metal blade. Pecking is a form of indirect percussion whereby
      a second rock is used like a chisel between the hammerstone and the rock face,
      while scraping is created using a hard hammerstone, which is battered against
      the rock surface. A last, much rarer method of engraving is the bas-relief technique,
      where the area around the image is lowered (usually by polishing) thus making
      the figure raise over the surface.

    body: These methods of engraving are sometimes combined, as happens in the Sahara
      where the outline of pecked figures is polished afterwards. Although for the
      most part the engravings just depict the figures’ contour, on other occasions
      all or part of the image is infilled with pecking or polishing. In all these
      techniques, after differing periods of time the engraved surfaces weather and
      acquire the same darker patina as the original surface.
