    body: This app will take you to Game Pass Shelter, one of the most well-known
      rock art sites in South Africa. Situated in the Drakensberg mountains, the shelter
      is a sandstone recess atop a steep slope exhibiting vibrant rock paintings of
      people and animals. The interactive experience is a 360° tour and panoramic
      view of Game Pass, creating the backdrop of the context of the valley from the
      photography available, with interactive ‘hotspots’ with embedded 3D models and
      additional information from the Rock Art archive.

    body: This app uses images from the African Rock Art Image Project, the largest
      archive of digitised images (also known as ‘born digital’ artifacts) recording
      rock art sites across Africa. Over 25,000 digital photographs of rock art from
      across Africa have been catalogued – originally from the Trust for African Rock
      Art (TARA) – through generous support from the Arcadia Fund. The central remit
      of the project is to ensure global open access to the TARA archive by developing
      new and innovative ways of engaging with the archive.

    body: |-
      Using innovative digital technology and photogrammetry in combination with our extensive archival photographic collections, we started experimenting with making [3D models](https://sketchfab.com/britishmuseum/collections/african-rock-art) of rock art solely using 20-year-old digitised, archival photographs of the rock art sites.  Building on this work, we realised it would be possible to use these techniques to further contextualize rock art sites in their landscape environment, combining archival images and records with satellite imagery and 360° images of a site -- a technique which proves hugely important for possible reconstructions of heritage sites largely using historical photos!

      Working closely in collaboration with the African Conservation Trust (ACT) ([http://www.projectafrica.com/](http://www.projectafrica.com/)), our colleagues in South Africa, and Soluis ([http://www.soluis.com/heritage/](http://www.soluis.com/heritage/)), our technology partner, we were able to develop the Rock Art VR mobile app by combining our archival photography with additional 360° imagery and mapping of the site of Game Pass Shelter provided by ACT. Rather than simply using modern 3D scanning and regular VR methods, Soluis developed innovative solutions in order to combine the archival imagery, 360° photos, and satellite videos to create an immersive VR tour of Game Pass Shelter that would be still be accessible on widely-available smartphone technology and simple cardboard headsets. By using widely-available mobile technology, it will be possible for ACT and our other project partners in Africa to easily use the app for education and outreach purposes, in particular at rock art centres (Kamberg, Didima, and KZM museum) in South Africa where local custodians teach school children about rock art and its importance.

      the British Museum, where over 150 visitors used the app for the first time

      experience of using the app and saw the huge potential that this technology
      could have for experiencing heritage in exciting, new ways and gaining new audiences!
      The overall positive feedback has inspired us to further develop new projects
      using similar techniques to reconstruct rock art sites destroyed in recent conflicts
      using our historical collection of photos.\n\nAdditionally, we hope to continue
      to work with our project partners in Africa to further develop educational resources
