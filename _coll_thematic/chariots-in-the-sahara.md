    title_internal: 'Thematic: chariots, chapter 1'
    body: A number of sites we have been cataloguing recently, located in the Libyan
      Desert, notably the Fezzan region, have included paintings of chariots in a
      variety of forms, dating to the Horse Period, from up to 3,000 years ago. This
      has stimulated some interesting questions about the use of chariots in what
      appears to be such a seemingly inappropriate environment for a wheeled vehicle,
      as well as the nature of representation. Why were chariots used in the desert
      and why were they represented in such different ways?

    title_internal: 'Thematic: chariots, chapter 2'
    body: The chariot has been one of the great empowering innovations of history.
      It likely originated in Mesopotamia about 3000 BC due to advances in metallurgy
      during the Bronze Age, and has served as a primary means of transport until
      quite recently in the historical period across Africa, Eurasia and Europe. Chariots
      provided rapid and efficient transport, and were ideal for the battlefield as
      the design provided a raised firing platform for archers . As a result the chariot
      became the principal war machine from the Egyptians through to the Romans; and
      the Chinese, who owned an army of 10,000 chariots. Indeed, our use of the word
      car is a derivative of the Latin word carrus, meaning ‘a chariot of war or of
      triumph’.

    body: The chariot in the Sahara was probably introduced by the Garamantes, a cultural
      group thought to be descended from Berbers and Saharan pastoralists. There is
      little textual information about the Garamantes, documentation comes mainly
      from Greek and Roman sources. Herodotus described them as ‘a very great nation’.
      Recent archaeological research has shown that the Garamantes established about
      eight major towns as well as numerous other settlements, and were ‘brilliant
      farmers, resourceful engineers, and enterprising merchants’. The success of
      the Garamantes was based on their subterranean water-extraction system, a network
      of underground tunnels, allowing the Garamantian culture to flourish in an increasingly
      arid environment, resulting in population expansion, urbanisation, and conquest.

    title_internal: 'Thematic: chariots, chapter 4'
    body: On average there are about 500 drawings of chariots across the Sahara, from
      the Fezzan in Libya through the Aïr of Niger into northern Mali and then westward
      to the Atlantic coast; but not all were produced by the Garamantes. It is still
      not certain that chariots were driven along the routes where their depictions
      occur; remains of chariots have never been found west of the Fezzan. However,
      the Fezzan states were thriving trade routes and chariots are likely to have
      been used to transport salt, cloth, beads and metal goods in exchange for gold,
      ivory and slaves. The widespread occurrence of chariot imagery on Saharan rock
      outcrops has led to the proposition of ‘chariot routes’ linking North and West
      Africa. However, these vehicles were not suited for long-distance transport
      across desert terrain; more localised use is probable, conducted through middlemen
      who were aware of the trade routes through the desert landscape. Additionally,
      the horse at this time was a prestige animal and it is unlikely that they facilitated
      transport across the Saharan trade routes, with travellers rather utilising
      donkeys or oxen.

    title_internal: 'Thematic: chariots, chapter 5'
    body: The absence of archaeological evidence for chariots has led to the suggestion
      that some representations of chariots may have been the result of cultural diffusion,
      transmitted orally by nomadic peoples traversing the region. Artists may never
      have actually seen the vehicles themselves. If this is the case, chariot symbols
      may have acquired some special meaning above their function as modes of transport.
      It may also explain why some representations of chariots do not seem to conform
      to more conventional styles of representations and account for the different
      ways in which they were depicted.

      Figs. 7 and 8 may or may not depict chariots. The rectangular shape in the top left of Fig. 7 and to the left in Fig. 8 are potentially abstracted forms of the chariot similar to the ‘flattened out’ depictions above in Figs. 5 and 6. The representation in Fig. 7 sits alongside distinguishing figures of the Horse Period when chariots were being used, such as geometric bi-triangular figures, spears or lances, women wearing long dresses, and animals drawn in a fairly naturalistic style.

      Beside the schematic and simply depicted chariots, there is also a group which has been termed the ‘flying gallop chariots’ (Fig.3 above and Fig. 9 below). Their distribution includes the whole Tassili region, although there are fewer in the Acacus Mountains. They resemble the classical two-wheeled antique chariots, generally drawn by two horses, but sometimes three, or even four. The driver is usually alone, and is depicted in a typical style with a stick head. The majority are shown at full speed, with the driver holding a whip standing on a small platform, sometimes straining forward.

      In a similar manner to the schematic chariots, the depictions in Figs. 3 and 9 display the entire platform and both wheels of the chariot. In addition, more than one horse is depicted as a single horse in profile with numerous legs indicating multiple horses; an artistic technique first seen during the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe. Interestingly, in the Libyan rock art of the Acacus Mountains it seemed that animals could be conceived of in profile and in movement, but chariots were conceived of differently, and are represented in plain view, seen from above or in three-quarters perspective.

      Why are chariots depicted in a variety of ways, and what can we say about the nature of representation in relation to chariots? It is clear that chariots are able to be depicted in profile view (Fig. 1), yet there are variations that digress from this perspective. In relation to the few examples we have come across so far in the Acacus Mountains in south-western Libya, one observation we might make is that the ways in which chariots have been represented may be indicative of the ways in which they have been observed by the artists representing them; as a rule from above. The rock shelters in the Acacus are often some height above the now dried up wadis, and so the ways in which they conceived of representing the chariot itself , whether as a flying gallop chariot, a chariot drawn by a bovid or as an abstraction, may have become a particular representational convention. The ways in which animals were represented conformed also to a convention, one that had a longer tradition, but chariots were an innovation and may have been represented as they were observed; from higher up in the rockshelters; thus chariots were conceived of as a whole and from an aerial perspective. The ways in which environments affect our perceptions of dimension, space and colour are now well-established, initially through cross-cultural anthropological studies in the 1960s, and becoming better understood through more recent research concerning the brain. Of course, this is speculation, and further research would be needed to consider all the possibilities. But for now, we can start to see some intriguing lines of enquiry and research areas that these images have stimulated.

    body: Vast trading network across the Sahara Desert not only facilitated the spread
      of goods, but the routes served as a conduit for cultural diffusion through
      the spread of knowledge, ideas and technologies. Chariots were both functional
      and symbolic. As a mode of transport, as a weapon of war, as a means of trade
      and exchange and as a symbol of power, the chariot has been a cultural artefact
      for 4,000 years. Its temporal and spatial reach is evident not only in the rock
      art, but through the British Museum collections, which reveal comparisons between
      2D rock art and 3D artefacts. Similarities and adjacencies occur not only in
      the structure and design of the chariots themselves but in their symbolic and
      pragmatic nature (Figs. 10–14).

    body: A hoard of 100,000 Roman coins from the Diocletian period (not the above)
      were unearthed near Misurata, Libya, probably used to pay both regular Roman
      and local troops. Such finds demonstrate the symbolic power of the chariot and
      the diffusion of the imagery.
