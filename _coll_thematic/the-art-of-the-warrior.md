      Historically, much of the rock art from across northern Africa has been classified according to a particular style or ‘school’ of depictions. One such category of images, known as the Libyan Warrior School or Libyan Warrior style is found predominantly in Niger. Typically, this style

      “…commonly depicts human figures, mainly armed warriors; women are very rare. The style is fairly crude and the technique unsophisticated, almost invariably a rather careless pecking. The figures, almost always presented frontally with their heads quite circular, with added lobes, or mushroom-shaped, are shown according to a symmetrical schema. Various garment decorations and feathers in the hair are common, and the warrior often holds one or two throwing-spears – the bow is almost lacking – and frequently also holds by the leading rein a typical horse; foreshortened with large hindquarters” (Muzzolini, 2001:614)

      Termed *Libyan Warriors* by French ethnographer Henri Lhote, these representations have been associated with Garamantes’ raids, possibly 2,500 years ago. Thought to be descended from Berbers and Saharan pastoralists who settled in central Libya from around 1500 BC, the Garamantes developed a thriving urban centre, with flourishing trade networks from Libya to Niger. In contrast, Francis Rodd, a military man who led two big expeditions to the Sahara in the 1920s, proposed that these figures represent Tuareg; a people reputedly of Berber descent who live a nomadic pastoralist lifestyle. They have their own script known as Tifinagh, which is thought to have Libyan roots and which is engraved onto rocks alongside other rock art depictions.

      Libyan Warrior figures are almost exclusively located in the Aïr Mountains of Niger although can also be found in the Adrar des Iforas, north-east Mali extending into Algeria.  Defining the Libyan Warrior Period chronologically is a challenge and dates are fairly fluid; the earliest dates suggested start from 5,200 years ago; it certainly coincides with the Horse period between 3,000-2,000 years ago but has also been proposed to continue throughout the Camel Period, from 2,000 years ago to present.

      From the sample of images we have as part of this collection it is clear that not all figures designated as falling under the umbrella term of Libyan Warrior style all share the same characteristics; there are similarities, differences and adjacencies even between what we may term a ‘typical’ representation. Of course, if these images span a period of 5,000 years then this may account for the variability in the depictions.

    body: However, for the majority of figures their posture is remarkably similar
      even though objects of material culture and the types of garments they wear
      may show more diversity. The overriding feature is that figures are positioned
      frontally with arms bent and raised, often displaying splayed fingers. In some
      cases figures hold weapons and shields, but some do not. Some wear obviously
      elaborate headdresses, but in others the features look more coiffure-like. Selected
      garments are decorated with geometric patterns, others are plain; not all wear
      items of personal ornamentation. Certainly, not all figures are associated with
      horses, as typically characterised. Moreover, rather than all being described
      as unsophisticated or careless, many are executed showing great technique and
      skill. So how do we start to make sense of this contradiction between consistency
      and variation?

    body: A criticism of Saharan rock art research, in comparison to that which has
      focused on other parts of Africa, is an under-theorisation of how the art links
      to past ethnic, archaeological or other identities (Smith,2013:156). This is
      tricky when dealing with past societies which were potentially nomadic, and
      where their archaeological remains are scarce. However, recent anthropological
      research may inform our thinking in this area. A member of the Wodaabe cultural
      group (nomadic cattle-herders and traders in the Sahel) on seeing a photograph
      of a Libyan-Warrior engraving and noting the dress and earrings told photographer
      Carol Beckwith that it represents a woman performing a traditional greeting
      dance with arms outstretched and about to clap (Coulson and Campbell,2001:210).

    body: "Such a comment suggests that local ethnographies might assist in an understanding
      of more recent rock art, that not all figures described as Libyan-Warrior may
      necessarily be the same; and indeed that women may not be as rare as previously
      documented. In fact, the Wodaabe have been noted to resemble figures in other
      Saharan rock art contexts (see article on Hairdressing in the Acacus).\n\nIf
      we accept that some of these representations share affinities with the Wodaabe
      then thinking about this category of images from an ethnographic perspective
      may prove productive. Moreover, the British Museum’s existing ethnographic collections
      are simultaneously a useful resource by which we can potentially add more meaning
      to the rock art images.\n\nThe Wodaabe belong to the Fulani people, numbering
      20 million and currently living across eighteen countries. The Wodaabe comprise
      2-3% of the Fulani cultural group, still live as true nomads and are considered
      to have the most traditional culture of all the Fulani (Bovin,2001:13).\t\n"

    body: "The Wodaabe have become particularly well-known in the West through visual
      anthropology, because of their emphasis on cultivating male personal beauty
      and adornment. Men invest enormous amounts of time in personal artistic expression;
      much more so than women. Anthropologists have documented the constant checking
      of Wodaabe men in their mirrors; a Wodaabe man will not even go out among the
      cows in the morning until he has checked and tidied himself. They spend hours
      every day on their appearance and have been described as styling themselves
      like “living paintings” and “living statues” (Bovin, 2001:72). Symmetry plays
      a particularly significant part in Wodaabe culture and is reflected in all their
      artistic expressions. Symmetry stands for culture, asymmetry stands for nature.
      Culture is order and nature is disorder (Bovin,2001:17). Everyday Wodaabe life
      is imbued with artistic expression, whereby “every individual is an active creator,
      decorator and performer (Bovin, 2001:15).\n\nSo, how might we see Wodaabe cultural
      traits reflected in the Libyan-Warrior figures?\n\nPlumage is often depicted
      on these Warrior figures and for the most part is assumed to simply be part
      of the warrior regalia. The ostrich feather, a phallic symbol in Wodaabe culture,
      is an important element in male adornment and is carefully placed in the axis
      of symmetry in the middle of a man’s turban, worn during dancing ceremonies
      (Bovin, 2001:41). Music and dancing are typical of Fulani traditions, characterized
      by group singing and accompanied by clapping, stomping and bells. The feathers
      in the British Museum’s collections are known to be dance ornaments, worn during
      particular ceremonies. \n"

    body: However, others may represent shoulder bags or flat baskets which are used
      as vessel covers or food trays; both of which are vital items in a nomadic lifestyle.
      Alternatively, they may represent calabashes. Wodaabe women measure their worldly
      wealth in calabashes and can acquire many in a lifetime, mostly ornamental to
      be displayed only on certain ceremonial occasions. If some of these depictions
      are not necessarily men or warriors then what have been considered shields may
      in fact represent some other important item of material culture.

      torso which may reflect traditional garments. This armless Wodaabe vest is decorated
      with abstract geometric combinations; patterns similar to those found on amulets,
      bags, containers and other artefacts as well as rock art.

      There is also a consensus within Wodaabe society about beauty and ugliness; what makes something beautiful or indeed ugly generally is agreed upon, there is a commonality of taste. This may account for the paradox of why there is individuality within a corpus of images that inherently are comparable (Bovin,2001:16).

      As nomads, Wodaabe do not identify themselves by place or territory as such, but a Wodaabe’s body is a repository of culture to mark them out against nature. Culture is not seen as an unessential indulgence but as an imperative necessity, it is part of one’s survival and existence in an inhospitable environment. We may speculate that rock art images may be seen as a way of stamping culture on nature; markers of socialised space.

    body: This brief review was motivated, in part, by the underlying problems inherent
      in the categorisation of visual culture. Historically assigned classifications
      are not fixed and armed with current knowledge across a range of resources we
      may provide further insights into these enigmatic representations. Obviously,
      a much more systematic study of this category known as Libyan-Warrior figures
      needs to be undertaken to determine their distribution and the similarities
      and differences between depictions across sites. Additionally, care must be
      taken making connections with a cultural group whose material culture has changed
      over the course of the twentieth century. Nevertheless, it seems the category
      of Libyan-Warrior figures is an area that is ripe for more intensive investigation.
