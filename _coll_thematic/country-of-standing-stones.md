    body: Ethiopia is home to some of the most impressive archaeological remains in
      Africa, such as the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela, the Axumite kingdom monoliths
      or the Gondar palaces. Most of these sites are located in northern Ethiopia,
      but to the south of the country there are also some remarkable archaeological
      remains, less well-known but which deserve attention. One of them is the dozens
      of graveyards located along the Rift valley and marked by hundreds of stone
      stelae of different types, usually decorated. Ethiopia holds the biggest concentration
      of steale in all Africa, a testimony of the complexity of the societies which
      inhabited the Horn of Africa at the beginning of the second millennium AD.

    body: Although some of the most impressive stelae are located to the north-east
      of Ethiopia, in the region where the Axumite Kingdom flourished between the
      1st and the 10th centuries AD, the area with the highest concentration of stelae
      is to the south-west of the country, from the Manz region to the north of Addis
      Ababa to the border with Kenya. It is a extensive area which approximately follows
      the Rift Valley and the series of lakes that occupy its floor, and which roughly
      covers the Soddo, Wolayta and Sidamo regions. The region has a tropical climate
      and is fertile, with warm conditions being predominant and rainfall being quite
      abundant, with annual rates of 1200-1500 mm in the lower areas while in the
      highlands the rainfall reaches 2.000 mm per year.

    body: 'Ethiopian stelae have been known to western scholars since the end of the
      19th century, with the first examples documented in 1885 to the north of Addis
      Ababa and the news about the main group to the south arriving in 1905. The first
      archaeological works in the southern area took place in the 1920’s carried on
      by French and German researchers. The work of Père Azaïs was especially remarkable,
      with four expeditions undertaken between 1922 and 1926 which were partially
      published in 1931. Along with Azaïs, a German team from the Frobénius Institute
      started to study the site of Tuto Fela, a huge cemetery with hundreds of phallic
      and anthropomorphic stelae located in the Sidamo region. Since these early studies
      the archaeological remains were left unattended until the 1970’s, when Francis
      Anfray excavated the site of Gattira-Demma and organized a far more systematic
      survey in the area which documented dozens of stelae of different sizes and
      types. In the 1980’s, another French team started to study first Tiya and then
      Tuto Fela and another important site, Chelba-Tutitti, in a long-term project
      which has been going on for thirty years and has been paramount to understand
      the types, chronologies and distribution of these archaeological remains. The
      historical importance of these stelae was universally recognized in 1980, when
      Tiya was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. '

    body: 'The Ethiopian stelae show a great variability in shapes and decorations,
      but at least three main groups could be defined. The first corresponds to the
      so-called phallic stelae, long cylindrical stones with a hemispherical top delimited
      by a groove or ring (Jossaume 2012: 97). The body of the stela is sometimes
      decorated with simple geometric patterns. A second type is known as anthropomorphic,
      with the top of the piece carved to represent a face and the rest of the piece
      decorated with crossed patterns. These two types are common to the east of the
      Rift Valley lakes, while to the south of Addis Ababa and to the west of these
      lakes several other types are present, most of them representing anthropomorphs
      but sometimes plain instead of cylindrical. These figures are usually classified
      depending on the shape and especially the features engraved on them –masks,
      pendants, swords- with the most lavishly carved considered the most recent.
      Probably the best known group is that with swords represented, such as those
      of Tiya, characterized by plain stones in which groups of swords (up to nineteen)
      are depicted along with dots and other unidentified symbols. Not all the stelae
      have these weapons, although those that don’t are otherwise identical in shape
      and have other common signs engraved on them.  Regarding their chronology the
      Ethiopian stela seem to be relatively new, dated from the 10th to the 13th centuries,
      sometimes with one type of stela superimposed on another and in other cases
      with old types being reused in later tombs.'

    body: 'Regardless of their chronology and shape, most of the stela seem to have
      a funerary function, marking the tombs of deceased which were buried in cemeteries
      sometimes reaching hundreds of graves. The information collected from sites
      of such as Tuto Fela show that not all the burials had an attached stela, and
      considering the amount of work necessary to prepare them those which had could
      be interpreted as belonging to high status people. In some cases, such as in
      Tiya, it seems evident that the stela marked the graves of important personalities
      within their communities. It is difficult to determine who the groups that carved
      these stelae were, but given their chronology it seems that they could have
      been Cushitic or Nilotic-speaking pastoralist communities absorbed by the Oromo
      expansion that took place in the sixteenth century. A lot of research has still
      to be done about these graveyards and their associated living spaces, and undoubtedly
      many groups of stelae are yet to be discovered. Those studied show, however,
      the potential interest of ancient communities still poorly known but which were
      able to develop complex societies and these material expressions of authority
      and power. '
