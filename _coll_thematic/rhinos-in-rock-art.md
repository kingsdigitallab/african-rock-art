    body: Around 30,000 years ago, in the hot, arid environment of the Huns Mountains
      in southern Namibia, modern humans painted images of animals, including rhinoceros,
      onto plaques of stone. A couple of thousand years earlier, in the cold, harsh
      tundra-like conditions of the Ardèche in south-central France, modern humans
      were also painting images of rhinoceros onto cave walls. The oldest scientifically
      dated rock art in Africa and Europe may be 8000 km apart but coincide both temporally
      and in subject matter. One of the oldest images that humans selected to depict
      was the formidable rhinoceros. The choice of subject matter in rock art depictions
      was not simply based on the presence or abundance of a particular species; rather
      they were conveying messages about the significance of an animal.

      continent and while their meaning is not always known, they are often depicted
      using great artistry, skill and knowledge of animal physiology. However, research

      can weigh up to 3.6 tonnes. Females are considerably smaller at about half the

    body: The black rhino is smaller than the white rhino, although adults can still
      reach 1.5 metres in height and weigh in at 1.4 tonnes. The black rhino has a
      reputation for being extremely aggressive, and will not hesitate to charge at
      a perceived threat.  Black rhinos were once common throughout sub-Saharan Africa.
      However, persistent hunting by European settlers saw their numbers quickly decline,
      and they currently number around 5,000. The species is currently found in patchy
      distribution throughout South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya.

      In both species, a layer of fat sits between the hide and the flesh of the animal and in the white rhinoceros this can be up to or exceed a thickness of 50mm. It is well known that San|Bushmen believed the fat around the heart of the eland contained high levels of supernatural potency, and like the eland, they believed the rhinoceros to be especially potent animals (Ouzman, 1996:45)

      Rhinoceros in rock art imagery are both painted and engraved, but the prevalence of engraved images in southern African rock art is pronounced. Rhinoceros are well represented, even dominant, at numerous engraving sites in the Free State, Gauteng, Northern Cape and North West provinces of South Africa and at numerous Namibian sites (Ouzman, 1996:42)

    body: "Most rock art researchers consider the engravings of San/Bushmen, like
      paintings, to have been influenced by shamanism (Ouzman, 1996:36). Both painted
      and engraved images share certain distinctive traits which suggest that both
      art forms were the result of a single belief system. These shared features include:
      a selected range of animals, unusual body postures in human figures, complex
      ‘scenes’ and non-realistic features on both animals and humans such as the addition
      or absence of limbs, conflation of human and animal morphology and exaggerated
      attributes (Ouzman, 1996:36) These features are critical to our understanding
      of the images as they are inextricably tied in to San|Bushman belief systems.\n\nThere
      are very few references to rhinoceros in San|Bushman ethnography. However, what
      does exist indicates that rhinoceros were of supernatural importance to certain
      groups of San|Bushmen (Ouzman, 1996:42). One particular site named Thaba Sione
      in South Africa, is primarily known for its numerous engravings of rhinoceros
      and may have been chosen as an engraving site because rhinoceros were known
      to have frequented the site. \n\nThaba Sione (Zion’s Hill) a low hill of less
      than nine metres in height is an important archaeological and rock art site
      in the North West province. It is scattered with more than 450 engraved dolerite
      boulders with the seasonal Thlakajeng River running 350 metres south-west containing
      numerous waterholes. The hill is bounded by 27 standing stones that have been
      rubbed smooth by rhinoceros after wallowing in the muddy waterholes of the river
      (Ouzman, 1996:40). Interestingly, one third of all the stones that he been rubbed
      by rhinoceros are also engraved (Lewis-Williams & Blundell, 1998:111).\n"

    body: "Dating rock engravings is always problematic, and the imagery at Thaba
      Sione has been estimated to fall within a broad estimate of between 1,200 -
      10,000 years old (Ouzman, 1995:55). Rock art of the last 2,000 years correlates
      with a number of different cultural groups such as farmers, pastoralists, hunter-gatherers
      etc. However, the rock art at Thaba Sione is attributed to San|Bushmen and widely
      understood to reflect a shamanic belief system. Situated close to a waterhole
      it has been proposed that Thaba Sione was selected specifically by the San|Bushmen
      for rain-making beliefs and practices, but appears to have been modified as
      a result of Bantu-speaking farmers moving into the area from around 1500 years
      ago.\n\nIt is thought that the population of Thaba Sione were similar in social,
      economic and cultural terms to the now extinct |Xam, a cultural group who inhabited
      the central interior of South Africa and for whom we have extensive ethnographic
      accounts. Additionally, they are likely to have been similarly comparable to
      the !Kung and Ju|’hoan, contemporary cultural groups who live to the north of
      Thaba Sione in Botswana and Namibia. A comparison of rock art imagery at Thaba
      Sione and the ethnographic accounts of the |Xam and !Kung show strong similarities
      in belief systems pertaining to shamanism (Ouzman, 1996:39).\n\nThaba Sione
      has been a primary focus for archaeologists as there are [559 identified engraved
      images ](http://bit.ly/2pLfwp4)located on or close to the hill site showing
      a wide variety of depictions. Images include baboon, birds, buffalo, eland,
      elephant, felines, giraffe, human figures, lizard, ostrich, rhinoceros, warthog
      and zebra (Ouzman, 1996:41). "

    body: Rhinoceros constitute the second largest category of identifiable imagery
      (62 or 11.1%), after human figures (72 or 12.9%) (Ouzman, 1996:43). Of the 62
      engravings, around 65% have been identified as white rhinoceros, based on the
      animals’ pronounced nuchal hump (the hump on the dorsal part of the neck), its
      large front horn and its square lip. The remaining 35% are of the smaller black
      rhino based on the hook lip that hangs from its upper jaw and its smaller nuchal
      hump. Historically, both species of rhinoceros were widespread in the area around

    body: "Rhinoceros show more ‘non-real’ features, combinations and variations in
      engraving techniques and occur in more complex ‘scenes’ than any other category
      of image at the site.\n\nFive of the engravings of rhinoceros are notable by
      the presence of ‘non-realistic’ features. Although the number of rhinoceros
      with these attributes is very small in comparison to the overall number of images
      of rhinoceros, it has been proposed that the placement and number of these features
      outweigh those found on other images. Such features are thought to convey information
      which related to three aspects of San shamanism, namely “shamanic transformation,
      gender relations and rain-making” (Ouzman, 1996:42).\n\nOne of these five images
      shows a part-human and part-rhinoceros figure. The posture of this therianthropic
      figure has its hand to its nose. When shamans are performing their medicine
      dance, they sometimes experience bleeding from the nose both before and after
      they enter a trance-like state. This posture combined with other features such
      as two rhinoceros-like horns, a short, thick, rhino-like tail, one back leg
      akin to that of a rhinoceros and the other back leg terminating in a human foot,
      as well as a fat pendulous body has been proposed to be a “shaman in a trance
      who has assumed, in part, rhinoceros form and potency” (Ouzman, 1996:46).\n\nAnother
      engraving shows the horns of two black rhinoceros which have been deliberately
      elongated and truncated respectively in order to project towards a fissure in
      the rock face. It has been argued that cracks or fissures in the rock face were
      seen as entry and exit points to the spirit world and the rock face acted as
      veil between these two worlds. These two horns are thus not real but are closely
      associated with the spirit world which the rhinoceros are entering, leaving
      or even guarding (Ouzman, 1996:49). \n"

    body: 'An additional engraving of a black rhinoceros shows three horns and has
      been argued to indicate a supernatural significance and possibly a transformed
      shaman. However, in real life female rhinoceros sometimes have a third horn
      as a deformity and this engraving possibly attempts to emphasise the role of
      the female shaman as a potent guardian and protector. Yet the message is unclear
      since, as black rhinoceros are known for their anti-social, unpredictable and
      violent behaviour it is uncertain whether engraved rhinoceros with “nuanced
      horns” are indicative of feminine or masculine gender and power relations, possibly
      containing elements of both. The shaman was a person who moved between the real
      and the non-real world, and is characterised by ambiguity and tension, so maintaining
      an indistinct gender identity in this context conforms to what we know of shamanic
      practices and representations (Ouzman, 1996:50). '

    body: "San|Bushman shamans were also inextricably linked with rain-making ceremonies.
      The ritual involved the whole of the community but it was the shaman, while
      in a trance-like state, that captured the rain in a perceived animal-like state.
      The rain animal was either seen as an ill-tempered ‘rain-bull’, characterised
      by thunder and lightning and harmful to life, or as a more pleasant ‘rain-cow’,
      which provided the temperate rains that renewed the grassland (Ouzman, 1996:51)
      Rain animals were not seen as a distinct species of animal, but were depicted
      with large bodies and were often horned; one of the few ethnographic accounts
      that refer to rhinoceros implicate them in rain-making (Ouzman, 1996:52).  \n\nIn
      some contexts certain physical and behavioural characteristics of rhinoceros
      may have been perceived by some San|Bushman as closely paralleling the perceived
      appearance and behaviour of a rain animal. These features include its fat and
      horns, its association with water and its nocturnal habits (in San|Bushman accounts
      of rain-making, shamans capture the rain animals at night). If rhinoceros were
      associated with rain animals, the more gregarious white rhinoceros might have
      been equated with the rain-cow while the ill-tempered black rhinoceros with
      the angry rain-bull (Ouzman, 1996:54).\n\nAt further sites in the Free State
      province of South Africa and the Erongo Mountains of Namibia, painted therianthropic
      figures (part-human, part-rhinoceros) depicting unusual body postures reminiscent
      of the *Great Trance Dance* and non-realistic features such as exaggerated horn
      size also seem draw on the rhinoceros as an animal of potency (Hollmann and
      Lewis-Williams, 2006). Furthermore, a golden rhinoceros from the Iron Age site
      of Mapungubwe in northern South Africa is testament to the status in which these
      animals were held, not only by San/Bushmen, but by other cultural groups in
      southern Africa. Thriving between 1220-1300 AD, and inhabited by ancestors of
      the Shona people of Zimbabwe, Mapungubwe was the centre of the largest kingdom
      in the subcontinent, trading gold and ivory with China, India and Egypt. Made
      of gold foil wrapped around a wooden core, the rhinoceros is a symbol of leadership
      among the Shona.\n\nRhinos have been represented in rock art for more than 30,000
      years, and have played a significant spiritual and cultural role in African
      societies.\n"
