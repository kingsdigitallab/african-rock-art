    body: Around 30,000 years ago, in the hot, arid environment of the Huns Mountains
      in southern Namibia, modern humans painted images of animals, including rhinoceros,
      onto plaques of stone. A couple of thousand years earlier, in the cold, harsh
      tundra-like conditions of the Ardèche in south-central France, modern humans
      were also painting images of rhinoceros onto cave walls. The oldest scientifically
      dated rock art in Africa and Europe may be 8000 km apart but coincide both temporally
      and in subject matter. One of the oldest images that humans selected to depict
      was the formidable rhinoceros. The choice of subject matter in rock art depictions
      was not simply based on the presence or abundance of a particular species; rather
      they were conveying messages about the significance of an animal.

      continent and while their meaning is not always known, they are often depicted
      using great artistry, skill and knowledge of animal physiology. However, research

      may be incorporated into the cosmological belief systems of the San&#124;Bushman

      in the rock art.\n\nWhite rhinos are the second largest land mammal after the
      elephant. Their name comes from the Afrikaans word “weit”, which means wide
      and refers to the animal’s muzzle. Adult males can reach 1.85m in height and
      can weigh up to 3.6 tonnes. Females are considerably smaller at about half the
      weight of an adult male. Their territory covers South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe
      and Kenya. They live in herds of up to 14 animals and are quick and agile animals
      being able to run up to 50 km/h. \n"

    body: The black rhino is smaller than the white rhino, although adults can still
      reach 1.5 metres in height and weigh in at 1.4 tonnes. The black rhino has a
      reputation for being extremely aggressive, and will not hesitate to charge at
      a perceived threat.  Black rhinos were once common throughout sub-Saharan Africa.
      However, persistent hunting by European settlers saw their numbers quickly decline,
      and they currently number around 5,000. The species is currently found in patchy
      distribution throughout South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya.

      In both species, a layer of fat sits between the hide and the flesh of the animal and in the white rhinoceros this can be up to or exceed a thickness of 50mm. It is well known that San&#124;Bushmen believed the fat around the heart of the eland contained high levels of supernatural potency, and like the eland, they believed the rhinoceros to be especially potent animals (Ouzman, 1996:45)

      Rhinoceros in rock art imagery are both painted and engraved, but the prevalence of engraved images in southern African rock art is pronounced. Rhinoceros are well represented, even dominant, at numerous engraving sites in the Free State, Gauteng, Northern Cape and North West provinces of South Africa and at numerous Namibian sites (Ouzman, 1996:42)

    body: "Most rock art researchers consider the engravings of San/Bushmen, like
      paintings, to have been influenced by shamanism (Ouzman, 1996:36). Both painted
      and engraved images share certain distinctive traits which suggest that both
      art forms were the result of a single belief system. These shared features include:
      a selected range of animals, unusual body postures in human figures, complex
      ‘scenes’ and non-realistic features on both animals and humans such as the addition
      or absence of limbs, conflation of human and animal morphology and exaggerated
      attributes (Ouzman, 1996:36) These features are critical to our understanding
      of the images as they are inextricably tied in to San&#124;Bushman belief systems.\n\nThere
      are very few references to rhinoceros in San&#124;Bushman ethnography. However,
      what does exist indicates that rhinoceros were of supernatural importance to
      certain groups of San&#124;Bushmen (Ouzman, 1996:42). One particular site named
      Thaba Sione in South Africa, is primarily known for its numerous engravings
      of rhinoceros and may have been chosen as an engraving site because rhinoceros
      were known to have frequented the site. \n\nThaba Sione (Zion’s Hill) a low
      hill of less than nine metres in height is an important archaeological and rock
      art site in the North West province. It is scattered with more than 450 engraved
      dolerite boulders with the seasonal Thlakajeng River running 350 metres south-west
      containing numerous waterholes. The hill is bounded by 27 standing stones that
      have been rubbed smooth by rhinoceros after wallowing in the muddy waterholes
      of the river (Ouzman, 1996:40). Interestingly, one third of all the stones that
      he been rubbed by rhinoceros are also engraved (Lewis-Williams & Blundell, 1998:111).\n"

    body: "Dating rock engravings is always problematic, and the imagery at Thaba
      Sione has been estimated to fall within a broad estimate of between 1,200 -
      10,000 years old (Ouzman, 1995:55). Rock art of the last 2,000 years correlates
      with a number of different cultural groups such as farmers, pastoralists, hunter-gatherers
      etc. However, the rock art at Thaba Sione is attributed to San&#124;Bushmen
      and widely understood to reflect a shamanic belief system. Situated close to
      a waterhole it has been proposed that Thaba Sione was selected specifically
      by the San&#124;Bushmen for rain-making beliefs and practices, but appears to
      have been modified as a result of Bantu-speaking farmers moving into the area
      from around 1500 years ago.\n\nIt is thought that the population of Thaba Sione
      were similar in social, economic and cultural terms to the now extinct &#124;Xam,
      a cultural group who inhabited the central interior of South Africa and for
      whom we have extensive ethnographic accounts. Additionally, they are likely
      to have been similarly comparable to the !Kung and Ju|’hoan, contemporary cultural
      groups who live to the north of Thaba Sione in Botswana and Namibia. A comparison
      of rock art imagery at Thaba Sione and the ethnographic accounts of the &#124;Xam
      and !Kung show strong similarities in belief systems pertaining to shamanism
      (Ouzman, 1996:39).\n\nThaba Sione has been a primary focus for archaeologists
      as there are [559 identified engraved images ](http://bit.ly/2pLfwp4)located
      on or close to the hill site showing a wide variety of depictions. Images include
      baboon, birds, buffalo, eland, elephant, felines, giraffe, human figures, lizard,
      ostrich, rhinoceros, warthog and zebra (Ouzman, 1996:41). "

      large front horn and its square lip. The remaining 35% are of the smaller black
      rhino based on the hook lip that hangs from its upper jaw and its smaller nuchal
      hump. Historically, both species of rhinoceros were widespread in the area around
      Thaba Sione (Ouzman, 1996:45).

    body: "Rhinoceros show more ‘non-real’ features, combinations and variations in
      engraving techniques and occur in more complex ‘scenes’ than any other category
      of image at the site.\n\nFive of the engravings of rhinoceros are notable by
      the presence of ‘non-realistic’ features. Although the number of rhinoceros
      with these attributes is very small in comparison to the overall number of images
      of rhinoceros, it has been proposed that the placement and number of these features
      outweigh those found on other images. Such features are thought to convey information
      which related to three aspects of San shamanism, namely “shamanic transformation,
      gender relations and rain-making” (Ouzman, 1996:42).\n\nOne of these five images
      shows a part-human and part-rhinoceros figure. The posture of this therianthropic
      figure has its hand to its nose. When shamans are performing their medicine
      dance, they sometimes experience bleeding from the nose both before and after
      they enter a trance-like state. This posture combined with other features such
      as two rhinoceros-like horns, a short, thick, rhino-like tail, one back leg
      akin to that of a rhinoceros and the other back leg terminating in a human foot,
      as well as a fat pendulous body has been proposed to be a “shaman in a trance
      who has assumed, in part, rhinoceros form and potency” (Ouzman, 1996:46).\n\nAnother
      engraving shows the horns of two black rhinoceros which have been deliberately
      elongated and truncated respectively in order to project towards a fissure in
      the rock face. It has been argued that cracks or fissures in the rock face were
      seen as entry and exit points to the spirit world and the rock face acted as
      veil between these two worlds. These two horns are thus not real but are closely
      associated with the spirit world which the rhinoceros are entering, leaving
      or even guarding (Ouzman, 1996:49). \n"

    body: 'An additional engraving of a black rhinoceros shows three horns and has
      been argued to indicate a supernatural significance and possibly a transformed
      shaman. However, in real life female rhinoceros sometimes have a third horn
      as a deformity and this engraving possibly attempts to emphasise the role of
      the female shaman as a potent guardian and protector. Yet the message is unclear
      since, as black rhinoceros are known for their anti-social, unpredictable and
      violent behaviour it is uncertain whether engraved rhinoceros with “nuanced
      horns” are indicative of feminine or masculine gender and power relations, possibly
      containing elements of both. The shaman was a person who moved between the real
      and the non-real world, and is characterised by ambiguity and tension, so maintaining
      an indistinct gender identity in this context conforms to what we know of shamanic
      practices and representations (Ouzman, 1996:50). '

    body: "San&#124;Bushman shamans were also inextricably linked with rain-making
      ceremonies. The ritual involved the whole of the community but it was the shaman,
      while in a trance-like state, that captured the rain in a perceived animal-like
      state. The rain animal was either seen as an ill-tempered ‘rain-bull’, characterised
      by thunder and lightning and harmful to life, or as a more pleasant ‘rain-cow’,
      which provided the temperate rains that renewed the grassland (Ouzman, 1996:51)
      Rain animals were not seen as a distinct species of animal, but were depicted
      with large bodies and were often horned; one of the few ethnographic accounts
      that refer to rhinoceros implicate them in rain-making (Ouzman, 1996:52).  \n\nIn
      some contexts certain physical and behavioural characteristics of rhinoceros
      may have been perceived by some San&#124;Bushman as closely paralleling the
      perceived appearance and behaviour of a rain animal. These features include
      its fat and horns, its association with water and its nocturnal habits (in San&#124;Bushman
      accounts of rain-making, shamans capture the rain animals at night). If rhinoceros
      were associated with rain animals, the more gregarious white rhinoceros might
      have been equated with the rain-cow while the ill-tempered black rhinoceros
      with the angry rain-bull (Ouzman, 1996:54).\n\nAt further sites in the Free
      State province of South Africa and the Erongo Mountains of Namibia, painted
      therianthropic figures (part-human, part-rhinoceros) depicting unusual body
      postures reminiscent of the *Great Trance Dance* and non-realistic features
      such as exaggerated horn size also seem draw on the rhinoceros as an animal
      of potency (Hollmann and Lewis-Williams, 2006). Furthermore, a golden rhinoceros
      from the Iron Age site of Mapungubwe in northern South Africa is testament to
      the status in which these animals were held, not only by San/Bushmen, but by
      other cultural groups in southern Africa. Thriving between 1220-1300 AD, and
      inhabited by ancestors of the Shona people of Zimbabwe, Mapungubwe was the centre
      of the largest kingdom in the subcontinent, trading gold and ivory with China,
      India and Egypt. Made of gold foil wrapped around a wooden core, the rhinoceros
      is a symbol of leadership among the Shona.\n\nRhinos have been represented in
      rock art for more than 30,000 years, and have played a significant spiritual
      and cultural role in African societies.\n"
