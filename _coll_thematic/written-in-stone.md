    body: 'A remarkable feature of North African rock art is the existence of numerous
      engraved or painted inscriptions which can be found throughout the Sahara Desert.
      These inscriptions, generically named Libyco-Berber, are found from the west
      of Egypt to the Canary Islands and from the Mediterranean Sea to the Sahel countries
      to the south. Together with Egyptian hieroglyphs, they show us one of the earliest
      written languages in Africa and represent a most interesting and challenging
      topic in North African history. They appear in two different formats: engraved
      on *stelae* (mainly on the Mediterranean coast and its hinterland) or on rock
      faces, either isolated or alongside rock art paintings or engravings of the
      later periods of rock art.'

    body: Libyco-Berber characters were identified as written language as early as
      the 17th century, when some inscriptions in the language were documented in
      the Roman city of Dougga (Tunisia). They were deciphered by F. de Saulcy in
      1843 through the comparison of personal names with equivalent Punic names in
      bilingual scenes, although a few characters still remain uncertain. Since the
      beginning of the 19th century onwards many different proposals have been made
      to explain the origin, expansion and translation of these alphabets. There are
      three main explanations of its origin - the most accepted theory considers that
      the Libyco-Berber alphabet and principles of writing were borrowed from the
      Phoenician script, with other symbols added locally.

    body: A second, recent proposal has defended an indigenous (autochthonous) origin
      deriving from a stock of ancient signs –tribal tattoos, marks of ownership,
      or even geometric rock art- which could have resulted in the creation of the
      alphabet. Finally, a mixture of both theories accepts the borrowing of the idea
      of script and some Phoenician signs, which would be complemented with indigenous
      symbols. Although none of these theories can be fully accepted or refuted at
      the present moment, the proposal of a Phoenician borrowing has a wider support
      among linguistics and archaeologists.

      were proposed, but this division is not so evident, and some studies have identified
      up to 25 different groups (grouped in 5 major families); some of them show strong
      similarities while between  others  up to half of the alphabetic symbols may

      alphabetic symbols tend to be geometric, consisting of straight lines, circles

    body: 'The study of Libyco-Berber script faces some huge challenges. In addition
      to its aforementioned variability, it is necessary to differentiate the ancient
      languages spoken and written in North Africa during the Classical Antiquity
      for which a generic term of Libyco-Berber is used. Furthermore, Tifinagh script,
      the modern script of Tuareg people shares some symbols with the Libyco-Berber
      alphabet, but otherwise is a quite different language. Contemporary Tuareg cannot
      understand the old Libyco-Berber inscriptions although they recognize some symbols.
      Chronology represents another challenge: although the first dated inscription
      on a *stela* is from 138 BC, some pottery sherds with Libyco-Berber symbols
      could date from the 3rd century BC. For some researchers the oldest date (as
      old as the 7th century BC) is believed to correspond to an engraving located
      in the Moroccan High Atlas, although that theory is still under discussion.
      Finally, the characteristics of the scripts present some problems: they are
      usually short, repetitive and in many cases incomplete. Moreover, Libyco-Berber
      can be written in different directions (from right to left, bottom to top),
      complicating the identification, transcription and translation of the inscriptions. '

    body: Considering all these problems, what do we know about Libyco-Berber scripts?
      First of all, they normally used only consonants, although due to the influence
      of Punic (the language used in areas controlled or influenced by Carthage) and
      Latin, vowels were added in some alphabet variants. The translation of Libyco-Berber
      scripts is complicated, since the existing texts are very short and can only
      be translated through comparison with equivalent texts in Punic or Latin. Most
      of the translated scripts are very simple and correspond to personal and site
      names, or fixed formulations as “X son of Y”, characteristics of funerary epigraphy,
      or others such as, “It’s me, X”.  Perhaps surprisingly, some of the translated
      inscriptions have an amorous meaning, with expressions as “I, X, love Y”. As
      the known Libyco-Berber corpus of inscriptions grows, it seems possible that
      more and more inscriptions will be translated, leading to a better understanding
      of the languages.

    body: Of course, the Libyco-Berber scripts evolved through time, although discussion
      is still going on about the chronologies and rhythms of this process. After
      the adoption and development of the alphabet, the Libyco-Berber reached a consideration
      of “official language” in the Numidian kingdom, which flourished in the north-western
      coast of Africa during the two latest centuries BC. The kingdom was highly influenced
      by Carthage and Rome, resulting in the existence of bilingual inscriptions that
      were the key to the translation of Libyco-Berber scripts. After Roman conquest,
      Libyco-Berber was progressively abandoned as a written language in the area,
      but inscriptions in the Sahara were still common until an unknown moment in
      the first millennium BC (the scripts sometimes receiving the name of Tifinagh).
      The Berber language, however, has been preserved and a new alphabet was developed
      in the 1960s to be used by Berber people.

      led to a complex crossroads of terms, chronologies and theories which sometimes
      are contradictory and confusing.  For the Rock Art Image Project, a decision
      had to be made to define the painted or engraved scripts in the collection and
      the chosen term was Libyco-Berber, as most of the images are associated with
      paintings of the Horse and Camel periods and thus considered to be up to 3,000
      years old. Using the term Tifinagh could lead to misunderstandings with more
      modern scripts and the alphabet currently used by Berber peoples throughout
      North Africa.

    title_internal: 'Libyco-Berber: thematic, chapter 9'
    body: Undoubtedly, the deciphering of forgotten languages captures the imagination
      and is one of the most exciting challenges in the study of ancient cultures.
      However, it is usually a difficult enterprise, as extraordinary finds which
      aid translation such as the Rosetta Stone are fairly exceptional and most of
      the time the transcription and translation of these languages is a long and
      difficult process in which the meaning of words and grammar rules is slowly
      unravelled. Although there are no shortcuts to this method, there are some initiatives
      that help to ease the task. One of them is making available catalogues of high
      quality images of inscriptions which can be studied and analysed by specialists.
      In that sense, the Libyco-Berber inscriptions present in the Rock Art Image
      Project catalogue can be truly helpful for all those interested in one of the
      most fascinating languages in the world; a language, which albeit modified  has
      endured in different forms for hundreds of years.
