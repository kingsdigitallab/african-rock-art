    title_internal: 'Malawi: country, chapter 1'
    body: "Malawi is a landlocked country in south-eastern Africa, located between
      Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. It stretches from north to south with the eastern
      boundary of the country marked by the Lake Malawi. Rock art can be found throughout
      the country but is especially abundant in central Malawi, near the western border
      with Mozambique. It consists exclusively of paintings attributed to two very
      distinctive groups (hunter-gatherers and farmers), and shows obvious links with
      other sites located in Zambia and western Mozambique. The images consist mainly
      of animals, anthropomorphic figures and geometric symbols, with a chronology
      that ranges from the Late Stone Age to the 1950s.  \n"

    body: 'The geography of Malawi is conditioned by the Great Rift Valley, which
      runs from north to south and which contains Lake Malawi (also known as Lake
      Nyasa). Almost 600 km long and more than 50 km wide, Lake Malawi is the second
      biggest lake in Africa and a key geographical feature of Malawi and the surrounding
      countries, as well as an important economic resource for the country. The rest
      of the country west of the Rift Valley is dominated by high plateaus, mostly
      ranging from 900-1200 m above sea level but reaching 2500 m in the Nyika Plateau
      to the north and 3000 m at Mt. Mulanje, to the south. The climate is equatorial,
      with strong seasonal differences, and hotter in the southern part of the country. '

    body: 'Although rock art can be found in several areas in Malawi, the main concentration
      of sites is located in the Chongoni area, in the westernmost part of central
      Malawi, very near the border with Mozambique. In that area around 150 rock art
      sites have been located so far, belonging to the two main traditions of rock
      art found in the country. Other smaller concentrations of rock art can be found
      to the south and to the north-west, and around the southern side of Lake Malawi.
      The distribution of the different styles of Malawian rock art varies substantially:
      while the older paintings attributed to hunter-gatherers can be found everywhere
      throughout the country, those made by farmers are concentrated in the Chongoni
      area, as well as nearby areas of Mozambique and Zambia. Rock art is usually
      scattered throughout the landscape, in hilly areas where gneiss outcrops provide
      shelters and well-protected surfaces adequate for painting.  '

    title: Research history
    title_internal: 'Malawi: country, chapter 4'
    body: 'Rock art in Malawi has been documented by Europeans since at least the
      1920s, although it wasn’t until the 1950s when the first articles on the subject
      were published, and it was only in 1978 a first synthesis on Malawian rock art
      was undertaken (Lindgren, N.E.  & Schoffeleers, J.M. 1978). In the 1980s research
      increased, especially on Chongoni rock art as its importance as a secret society
      artefact became evident. In 1995 the Chongoni rock art area was comprehensively
      studied by Benjamin Smith as a part of his doctoral research (1995), which is
      still the main reference on the topic. Most of the research on Malawi rock art
      has focused on the study of the two different painting traditions found in Malawi.
      A basic proposal was made in 1978 when the red paintings—mostly geometric—considered
      older and attributed to hunter-gatherers, while white paintings were related
      to more modern groups of farmers which arrived early in the 2nd millennium AD
      and preserved their painting traditions until the 1950s. Since 1978, the knowledge
      of these two groups has substantially improved, with a more refined proposal
      made by Benjamin Smith in his doctoral dissertation.  '

      at the maintenance of painting traditions until relatively recent times. These
      exceptional examples  have provided  fertile ground for further research, as
      many of these later paintings have been effectively interpreted as parts of
      initiation rituals that are still undertaken today. The study of the secret
      societies that preserve this knowledge has been a characteristic feature of
      Malawi rock art research since the 1970s (Lindgren, N.E.  & Schoffeleers, J.M.  1978).  '

    body: 'Rock art in Malawi is clearly defined in two groups with different styles,
      chronologies and production contexts. The first one is characterized by red
      schematic paintings with parallels in Central Africa from Malawi to Angola.
      These paintings are associated with the ancestors of modern Batwa hunter-gatherers,
      and can be classified into two different types. The first can be considered
      the most characteristic and is represented by circles with radiating lines,
      concentric circles, ovals, wavy or parallel lines. In some cases, red figures
      are infilled in white painting or white dots. The second type is very scarce
      (only two examples have been found in Chongoni) and depicts very schematic animals,
      sometimes accompanied by humans. Both types are finely executed with red oxide
      pigment. Regarding their interpretation, the figures seem to have been associated
      with rainmaking and fertility concepts. '

    body: 'The second and more modern rock art tradition found in Malawi is represented
      by white figures made with white clay daubed onto rock surfaces with the finger.
      Associated with the agriculturalist Chewa people, the depictions usually represent
      zoomorphic, spread-eagled or snake-like figures which could represent mythological
      beings, sometimes accompanied by geometric symbols.  As in the case of the schematic
      figures, two types of paintings have been proposed: those related to spread-eagled
      figures and those representing zoomorphs (animal-like figures). The paintings
      were made until several decades ago, as testified by depictions of cars that
      can be found at some sites. In this case, the interpretation of the paintings
      is straightforward, as the images depicted can still be related to current rituals
      often employing masks in a variety of shapes.  The spread-eagled paintings may
      be associated with a Chewa girl’s initiation ceremony and would act as a mnemonic
      tool during the ritual, while the zoomorphic paintings may depict spirit characters
      of the Chewa men’s secret society, the *nyau*. In many cases, these paintings
      can overlap the older red paintings already existing at some sites'

      discussion.  The earliest evidence for human occupation in the region according
      to the archaeological record is around 2,500 years ago, and it is generally
      assumed that Late Stone Age hunters and gatherers made this rock art. Unfortunately
      no datable evidence has been found although groups of these people survived
      until the 1800s in Malawi. For the white paintings, chronologies are more accurate:
      the Chewa people are thought to have arrived to central Malawi in the 15th century,
      and as aforementioned, painting traditions were still alive in the mid-20th
      century.  '
