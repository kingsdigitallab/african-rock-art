    title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 1'
    body: 'Zimbabwe is a landlocked country surrounded by Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana
      and South Africa, occupying a large, granitic high plateau between the Zambezi
      and Limpopo river systems, with a tropical climate moderated by altitude. The
      highest part of the country is the eastern Highlands; a north-south mountain
      range reaching altitudes of 2,500 m. Rock art is located in two main areas,
      the northern region of Mashonaland and the south-western area of Matabeleland.
      These areas are full of granite hills and boulders that provide excellent shelters
      for the paintings. The Matobo hills in Matabeleland constitute one of the most
      outstanding examples of rock art in Southern Africa. The total number of Zimbabwean
      rock art sites is unknown, but estimations made point to thousands of sites
      throughout the country, with more being discovered annually. '

    title: History of the research
    title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 2'
    body: 'Zimbabwean rock art was first reported by Europeans in 1927, when Miles
      Burkitt visited southern Africa, but is especially linked to Leo Frobenius,
      one of the most renowned researchers in the first decades of the 20th century.
      Leo Frobenius travelled to the region in 1928 with a German team and thoroughly
      documented numerous paintings, identifying many of the most characteristic features
      of Zimbabwean rock art. However, he failed in identifying the authors of the
      paintings, ascribing them to external influences of “high civilizations” instead
      to the local communities who made them. Subsequently, work was continued by
      Elizabeth Mannsfeld-Goodall, who for forty years documented rock art paintings
      constituting a huge corpus of tracings, but without developing an interpretative
      framework for them. In the 1950s, another historic researcher, the Abbé Henri
      Breuil, visited Zimbabwe and studied the paintings, again suggesting an Egyptian
      or Minoan origin. It wasn’t until the 1960s and 1970s when a more objective
      approach to the study of rock art started, with Peter Garlake the most prominent
      figure in research from the 1980s onwards. Garlake wrote the first comprehensive
      books on Zimbabwean rock art (Garlake 1987), integrating it within the general
      framework of southern Africa and raising awareness about the importance of these
      archaeological expressions. In 2003 the Matobo Hills were included in the World
      Heritage List acknowledging the relevance of Zimbabwean rock art for African
      heritage. '

    title: Themes
    title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 3'
    body: The rock art of Zimbabwe is some of the richest in Africa both in variety
      and complexity, the vast majority being painted figures infilled or outlined
      usually with just one colour, although bichrome examples are also known. The
      human figure is the most often represented engaged in different activities -hunting,
      walking, dancing- either isolated or in groups of up to forty people. The figures
      are depicted in different styles, from the very schematic to relatively naturalistic
      outlines, with men far more represented than women, and usually depicted carrying
      bows and arrows. In some cases, these figures are part of very complex scenes
      including animals and geometric symbols, some of which have been interpreted
      as trance-like scenes similar to those in South Africa with figures bleeding
      from their noses, crouching or dancing in groups or sharing animal traits. A
      very specific type of depiction is human figures with hugely distended abdomens,
      a trait that is associated either with fertility or mystic potency concepts.

    title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 4'
    body: 'Along with human figures, animals are widely represented in Zimbabwean
      rock art, with kudu depictions dominating, but also with zebra, tsessebe and
      sable antelopes commonly represented. Surprisingly, other antelopes such as
      eland, waterbucks or wildebeest are very rarely represented, while other animals
      (lions, cheetah, birds, ant bears, porcupines, baboons or warthogs) are very
      scarce. Fish and crocodiles are relatively common, the latter represented as
      if seen from above or below. There seems to be a preference for the depiction
      of females rather than males, especially in the case of antelopes or elephants.
      Regardless of the type of animal, the depictions seem to have a deep symbolism
      far beyond the representation of animals just hunted and consumed, often being
      surrounded by dots, flecks or networks of lines. That symbolism is especially
      important in the case of the elephant, which is often depicted being hunted
      by groups of men. '

      related to trance-like contexts and include dots, wavy lines or stripes. One
      of the most original types of symbols known as ‘formlings’, are oblong figures

    body: |-
      Traditionally, the themes expressed in Zimbabwean rock art have been identified as the same as those of the San&#124;Bushmen¹ from South Africa and in many cases are undoubtedly related, and provide key hints for their interpretation. However, there are also differences, such as the emphasis given to different animals, the higher presence of trees and plants in Zimbabwe or the smaller presence of trance scenes in the north compared to that of the Drakensberg. Moreover, the lack of ethnographic information for Zimbabwean paintings and their older chronology make it difficult to establish the same type of associations as those made for other areas with more direct connections rock art to known cultures, as happens in South Africa. Although in a minority, rock art of a later chronology can be attributed to Iron Age farmers, characterized by more schematic figures, usually white and painted thickly with the finger or the hand. As is the case in other areas in Central Africa, some of these later depictions are related to rain making and initiation ceremonies.

      ¹ San&#124;Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

    title_internal: 'Zimbabwe: country, chapter 6'
    body: "As with much rock art, the dating of Zimbabwe paintings is a challenging
      subject, although there is a consensus about them being significantly older
      than those of the Drakensberg and probably dated at before 2,000 years ago.
      The lack of any type of agriculture-related images in the paintings, which was
      established by the 1st millennium AD, sets a relative dating for the depictions,
      while the scarcity of sheep (introduced by the second half of the first millennium
      BC in the area) points to a time period in which these animals were still uncommon.
      These hints and the fact that, unlike in other areas there are not historical
      subjects represented in the paintings, seems to indicate that Zimbabwean paintings
      are at least 1,000 years old. However, archaeological evidence (Walker 2012:
      44) suggests that rock art could be significantly older than that, at least
      several thousands of years old. \n\n"
