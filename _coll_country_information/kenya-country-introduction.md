    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 1'
    body: Rock art is distributed widely throughout Kenya, although historically rock
      art research has not been as extensive as in neighbouring countries such as
      Tanzania. Some of Kenya's various rock art traditions are attributed to or associated
      with the ancestors of modern regional cultural groups, and as such sites sometimes
      retain local religious importance. Both painted and engraved imagery tends towards
      the symbolic and geometric, with occasional depictions of schematic animals
      and people. It must be noted that there are still probably many Kenyan rock
      art sites which have not yet become known outside of their local communities,
      if they are known at all.

    body: Kenya covers about 569,140km², bordering Ethiopia and Somalia in the north
      and east and Tanzania and Uganda in the south and west. The country stretches
      from a low-lying eastern coastal strip, inland to highland regions in the west
      of the country. Kenya's western half is divided by the eastern section of the
      East African Rift, the long area of tectonic divergence which runs from the
      coasts of Djibouti, Eritrea and Somalia down through Ethiopia and Kenya and
      into Uganda, curving around the eastern edge of the Lake Victoria basin. There
      are a significant number of painted rock art sites throughout west-central and
      southern Kenya.

    title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 3'
    body: 'Although researchers had been noting and investigating rock art in the
      neighbouring countries of Tanzania and Uganda from the early years of the 20th
      Century, the first published mention of Kenyan rock art appeared only in 1946,
      with Joy Adamson''s descriptions of engravings at Surima, in the northern Turkana
      region. It was in the 1960s that sustained academic attention began to be paid
      to other sites in the country. In 1961 Richard Wright published an account of
      a rock shelter (now known as Kiptogot Cave) with painted images of cattle on
      the slopes of Mount Elgon near Kitale. Wright suggested potential parallels
      in style with some Ethiopian pastoralist rock art. In 1968 Robert Soper was
      the first archaeologist to investigate the unique Namoratung’a burial sites
      to the east of Lake Turkana, with their engraved standing stones, the interpretation
      of which would be continued with the work of Mark Lynch and Lawrence Robbins
      in the 1970s. In the same decade significant painting sites at Lake Victoria,
      north of the lake near the Ugandan border, and in the far south were also reported
      on by James Chaplin, Osaga Odak and Richard Gramly. Research and discovery has
      continued and is likely that many rock art sites in Kenya remain to be documented.
      As recently as 2005, 21 previously unknown rock art sites in the Samburu area
      of central Kenya were recorded during dedicated survey work organised by the
      British Institute in East Africa.    '

    title: Themes
    title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 4'
    body: "Figurative imagery only features prominently in about 10% of the known
      rock art sites of Kenya.  That which exists tends to consist of very schematic
      images of cattle, wild animals and people. The majority of both painted and
      engraved rock art iconography throughout Kenya comprises symbols, with common
      patterns including circles, sometimes concentric or containing crosses, spirals,
      parallel or cross-hatched lines and curvilinear shapes.  Circular ground  depressions
      in the rock surface, known as cupules, are also a common variant of rock art
      in Kenya, along with rock gongs, which show evidence of the use of natural rock
      formations as percussive instruments.\n\nInterpretation, cultural attribution
      and proposed dates for these works vary widely across technique and area, although
      there are common themes.  It has been suggested that the schematic nature and
      similarities in the art may point to shared East African symbolic understandings
      common to different cultural groups, for example equating circular shapes (some
      of the most popular motifs in Eastern and Central African rock art in general)
      with chieftainship or the sun, or acting as navigation devices.\n\nGiven the
      variations in distance, age and nature of the sites, there is a danger of generalising,
      but there are factors which may contribute to more incisive interpretations
      of specific sites and symbols.  One set of interpretations for geometric shapes
      in Kenyan rock art points to the similarities of certain of these symbols to
      cattle brands used by Nilotic peoples throughout Kenya, including the Turkana,
      Samburu and Masai groups.  Although the engravings at Namoratung'a are not thought
      to have been made by ancestral Turkana people, Lynch and Robbins noted the similarities
      of some of the symbols found there to contemporary local Turkana cattle brands.
      \ These symbols are pecked on stones at graves containing mens’ remains and
      have been proposed to represent male lineages, as animal brands traditionally
      do in contemporary Nilotic ethnic groups. Further south, it is known that some
      more recent rock paintings representing brand and shield patterns were made
      by  Masai and Samburu men, in shelters used for meat-feasting—a  practice forbidden
      in their home compounds after their formal initiation as warriors—or as initiation
      sites. Actual representations of cattle are rare, with the vibrant paintings
      at Kakapel near the Ugandan border the most reknowned. Their creators are unknown
      although Masai and Samburu have been known to paint occasional schematic cattle
      in the past.    \n"

    title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 5'
    body: Not all of Kenya's rock art is associated with pastoralists. Much of the
      symbolic art, particularly to the south and west, is attributed to the ’Batwa’,
      ancestors of modern Batwa and related, traditionally hunter-gatherer cultural
      groups living around the Great Lakes Region of East and Central Africa.  Circular
      designs and “Sunburst” symbols are some of the most common motifs usually  associated
      with the Batwa rock art tradition; it has been proposed that they may have been
      associated  with fertility or rainmaking. Some rock art on Mfangano Island,
      in the Kenyan portion of Lake Victoria, has retained the latter association,
      having been used until the recent past by local Abasuba people for rainmaking
      purposes, despite their not having produced it originally. This re-use of symbolic
      sites in Kenya and the difficulty of dating further confuses the question of
      attribution for the art. The same rock art sites used by different cultural
      groups at different times and for different reasons. Such is the case at Kakapel
      for example, where it is posited that the earliest paintings may be hunter-gatherer
      in origin, with more recent cattle images added later, and Namoratung’a, with
      some engravings apparently hundreds of years old and others made within the
      last century.

    title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 6'
    body: It is instructive to consider the use of rock art sites within their physical
      contexts as well as the rock art motifs themselves.  Locality and landscape
      are significant, for example at Namoratung’a, where the engraved basalt pillars
      at a related nearby site have been posited to be positioned according to astronomical
      calculations, based on an ancient Cushitic calendar.  There are various ways
      in which the creation and continued use of sites in Kenya may have been significantly
      interactive, such as in the ritual playing of rock gongs, or in the potential
      use of rows of cupules as gaming boards for forms of Mancala, a token game common
      through central and Southern Africa which was originally introduced to Kenya
      via Indian Ocean trade.  It is not known if cupules were actually created for
      this purpose—it has been suggested for example that  in some areas, cupules
      were formed for purely practical purposes, in the pulverising of food or materials
      for smelting activities. In Kenya, as elsewhere, what actually constitutes rock
      art is not always easy to identify.

    title: Chronology
    title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 7'
    body: "Rock art ascribed to Batwa peoples could be anywhere between 15,000-1,000
      years old, while pastoralist art is more recent.  Radiocarbon dating of rock
      art is difficult unless it is buried and associated with other uncontaminated
      organic remains and as such, scientifically dated rock art from Kenya is rare.
      \ Radiocarbon dates from human remains in graves at Namoratung’a South date
      from the mid-1st Century BC to the mid-1st Millennium AD, but as dates like
      these are not directly relatable to the rock art, researchers have tended to
      concentrate on assigning chronologies based on varying levels of patination
      and style, without being able to ascribe more than estimated production dates.
      \ \n\nThere are occasionally defining limits which aid in dating  specific sites,
      for example, cattle did not arrive in Eastern Africa until about 2,000 BC, so
      representations of cattle must postdate this.  In addition, in some cases, artworks
      known to have been associated with certain groups cannot have been produced
      prior to, or post, certain dates for political reasons. For example, Masai paintings
      at Lukenya Hill are known to have been painted prior to 1915, as Masai people
      were displaced from this area by European settlers after this date.  \n\nThe
      diversity of Kenyan rock art in motif, distribution and cultural context so
      far frustrates any attempts for a cohesive chronology, but the continuing local
      engagement with rock art sites in Kenya can potentially serve as a useful dating
      and interpretive resource for researchers alongside continuing archaeological
      research."
