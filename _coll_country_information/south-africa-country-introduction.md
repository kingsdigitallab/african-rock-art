    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 1'
    body: |
      The rock art of South Africa has probably been studied more extensively than that of any other African country.  It is estimated that South Africa contains many thousands of rock art sites, with a great variety of styles and techniques.  The most well-known rock art in South Africa is that created by the San&#124;Bushman¹ people (several culturally linked groups of indigenous people of southern Africa who were traditionally hunter-gatherers) and their ancestors, with the painted rock shelters of the Drakensberg mountains some of the most well-known rock art sites in the world.  However, the range of South African rock art is wide, spanning great distances, many centuries, and different cultural traditions.

      ¹ San&#124;Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.  Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.

    title: Geography and rock art distribution
    title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 2'
    body: South Africa covers around 1,213,090 km², encircling Lesotho and bordered
      in the north by Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe and in the west by Mozambique
      and Swaziland.  Much of the interior of the country consists of a high central
      plateau bordered by the Great Escarpment, a rocky ridge which forms the bulk
      of the long Drakensberg mountain system in the east and several smaller ranges
      in the centre and west of the country, as well as the western border with Lesotho.  Further
      to the south, the Cape Fold Mountains mirror the bend of the cape coast.  Much
      of South Africa’s known engraved rock art is found on igneous or metamorphic
      formations in the semi-arid environments of the central plateau.  In contrast,
      painted rock art sites are more commonly located in the sandstone and quartzite
      rock shelters of the mountain systems, which form the edges of the more temperate,
      low-lying coastal regions in the east and south of the country.

    title: Hunter-gatherer rock art
    title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 3'
    body: Much of both the painted and engraved rock art of South Africa is characterised
      by its naturalistic depictions of animals, as well as numerous images of people,
      ambiguous figures with mixtures of animal and human features, and certain ‘geometric’
      or abstract shapes and patterns.  These images are the work of San&#124;Bushman
      people and their ancestors.  Although San&#124;Bushman communities now live
      mainly in Namibia, Botswana and north-western South Africa, historically San&#124;Bushman
      cultural groups lived more widely throughout southern Africa.  Hunter-gatherer
      people are thought to have been the only inhabitants of what is now South Africa
      until the arrival of herding and farming people from the north from around 2,000
      years ago.

    title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 4'
    body: "Some paintings and engravings in South Africa were made by Bantu language-speaking
      farming people.  These include a distinct tradition of rock shelter paintings
      found in the north-west of the country, featuring mostly white finger-painted
      images of animals such as crocodiles and giraffes and other motifs.  These paintings,
      located in remote areas, are known to have been created by Northern Sotho people.
      Further to the south and west, engraved designs showing conjoined circle motifs
      are found throughout KwaZulu Natal and some areas of Mpumalanga and Gauteng
      Provinces, and appear to have been made by the ancestors of Sotho-Tswana and
      Nguni language speakers, perhaps ancestors of modern Zulu people.\n\n"

    title: Herder rock art and other traditions
    title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 5'
    body: Some rock art styles and motifs elsewhere in South Africa seem to belong
      to other unique traditions.  It has been proposed that engraved rock art patterns
      with particular features including circular, linear and oblong motifs found
      at sites across the country, particularly near watercourses, may be the work
      of the Khoekhoen people or their ancestors, herders culturally related to the
      San&#124;Bushmen. Some paintings also appear to reflect this tradition. Local
      rock art traditions specific to certain areas include, among others, conglomerations
      of handprints near the coast in the south-western part of the Western Cape and
      rows of engraved cupules in the north-east of the country. There are also several
      examples from different rock art traditions across South Africa, of depictions
      of European people, items or events (such as horses and firearms) which clearly
      date from the 17th century or later.  In the Karoo region, rock gongs (natural
      rock formations with indentations indicating that they have been used as percussive
      instruments) are sometimes associated with engraving sites.

      since at least the mid- 18th century AD, with one of the first known reports
      from the expedition of  Ensign A. F. Beutler in 1752, describing paintings near
      the Great Fish River in the Eastern Cape.  Further written references to rock
      art from the area were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, with some
      of the earliest known reproductions of Southern African rock art made in the
      1770s. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, painted copies were made of
      San&#124;Bushman rock art by amateur artists such as George Stow, Mark and Graham
      Hutchinson and Helen Tongue. '

      assemblages. In 1928 renowned archaeologist and ethnologist Leo Frobenius mounted
      an expedition to record sites in South Africa as well as Zimbabwe and Namibia,
      while in the interior regions over the previous twenty years, Maria Wilman had
      instigated the first systematic rock engraving recording work. This endeavor
      was built upon from the late 1950s onwards with the extensive work of Gerhard
      and Dora Fock.  In the same decade Alex Willcox pioneered the practice of recording
      rock art through colour photography, and over the next twenty years, further
      recording and analysis projects were undertaken by researchers such as Tim Maggs

      analysing paintings from 150 Drakensberg sites and attempting to gain insight
      into their execution and significance through a combination of quantitative
      study and reference to San&#124;Bushman ethnography (written records of insights
      from San&#124;Bushman culture compiled by anthropologists).  Through the 1980s,
      interpretation of rock art was further developed, perhaps most significantly
      by David Lewis-Williams, a collaborator of Vinnicombe's. Lewis-Williams originated
      an approach to understanding San&#124;Bushman rock art which posits that the
      motivation and meaning for most, if not all, San&#124;Bushman rock art is based
      on the centrality of the spiritual leader or'shaman' and the shaman’s actions
      in San&#124;Bushman life and belief.  Over the past 30 years, the idea that
      much of San&#124;Bushman rock art is essentially ‘shamanistic’ in nature has
      been dominant in academic discourse.

    title_internal: 'South Africa: country, chapter 9'
    body: "Shamanistic interpretations of San&#124;Bushman paintings and engravings
      draw on both past records of ‘Southern’ or /Xam San&#124;Bushman people living
      historically in South Africa and more recent ethnography based mainly on San&#124;Bushman
      communities in Namibia and Botswana, suggesting that their imagery illustrated
      and reinforced the power of the actions of shamans. Much of the imagery is proposed
      to reflect the shaman’s hallucinatory visions from the 'trance dance’, a tradition
      common to San&#124;Bushman groups where shamans enter a trance state during
      which they visit a 'spirit world' in which they may go on spiritual journeys
      or perform tasks on behalf of their communities. It is thought that the rock
      art panels may have acted as reservoirs for the 'potency' that shamans are considered
      to possess, with the rock face considered a veil between both worlds.  The images
      are thought to reflect trance experiences including those of 'therianthropes’,
      images of figures with both human and animal features, explained as shamans
      who in a trance state feel themselves transformed into animals.  Certain other
      poses and features found in San&#124;Bushman rock art, such as so-called 'entoptic'
      motifs—geometric shapes such as zigzags and dots—have also been interpreted
      as reflecting visions that shamans experience while in a trance state.  \n\nDiscussion
      continues around the extent of the applicability of 'shamanist' interpretations
      for all aspects of San&#124;Bushman art, with research ongoing and scholars
      also exploring the potential roles of other elements in rock art production,
      such as mythology or gender and initiation rites.  Other avenues of study include
      more regional foci, on specific cultural and temporal contexts and how the imagery
      may reflect local power dynamics through time.\n"

      art, research has also been done on other rock art traditions, suggesting different
      cultural origins.  For example, investigation of Northern Sotho rock art has
      shown much of it to have been created in relation to boys''and girls'' initiation
      ceremonies, while Bantu-language speakers''engravings of interlinked circle
      patterns have been interpreted as images of idealised conceptualised homesteads.  Work
      on attribution for some rock art of uncertain authorship also has been undertaken.  Certain
      geometric forms of rock engraving may be of Khoekhoen origin, possibly showing
      influence from central African geometric traditions and tracing historical migrations
      southwards.  It has also been suggested that some finger-painted images in the
      centre of the country are the early 19th century work of the Korana people,
      a group of mixed ancestry living as raiders on the Cape frontier and incorporating
      motifs from San&#124;Bushman and other traditions. '

      dated to at least 3,600 years ago, while in the Drakensberg, AMS dating carried
      out on the oxalate crust superimposing a painting of a human figure has suggested
      it to be at least 1,800 years old.  While it is thought that the beginnings
      of the painting tradition in the Drakensberg region are probably older than
      this, the relative lack of durability in paint means that many of the existing
      paintings were probably made sometime within the past few hundred years. Sometimes
      it is apparent when this is the case - several painting sites in this region
      show images of both San&#124;Bushman people and Europeans riding horses and
      bearing firearms, which dates them to within the past 350 years and particularly
      the 19th century.  Images of sheep and cattle also place images within the last
      2,000 years.  \n\nThe oldest reliably dated evidence for deliberate engraving
      in the country is several ochre pieces incised with abstract patterns found
      in a buried layer in Blombos cave in the Western Cape and dated through a number
      of methods to between 70 and 100,000 years ago.  The earliest known figurative
      engraving date from the country comes from a slab with an image of a portion
      of an animal on it, excavated from Wonderwerk Cave in the Northern Cape and
      dating from around 10,200 years ago.  Engravings remaining in the open are more
      difficult to date scientifically, and various attempts have been made to date
      and sequence both engravings and paintings based on style and superimposition,
      while recent years, work has been undertaken to apply the Harris Matrix (an
      archaeological sequencing technique for relative dating) method to painting
      chronologies in the Free State, Drakensberg and Western Cape.  This involves
      using techniques originally conceived for charting chronology in stratigraphic
      layering to compare and sequence different superimposed motifs.\n"
