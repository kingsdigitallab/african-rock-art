    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 1'
    body: Ethiopia is the biggest country of the Horn of Africa, a very diverse country
      which has traditionally been a melting pot of cultures, religions and ethnicities,
      acting as a crossroads between the Nile valley region, the Red Sea and East
      Africa. Most rock art is located in the southern part of the country, although
      smaller concentrations have been documented near the borders with Eritrea, Sudan
      and Kenya. Ethiopian rock art shows strong similarities with other countries
      in the Horn of Africa as well as Sudan and mostly consists of cow depictions
      dated from the 3rd millennium onwards, although other animals, anthropomorphic
      figures and geometric symbols are also fairly common.

    title: Geography and rock art distribution
    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 2'
    body: The geography of Ethiopia is varied and ranges from high plateaus to savannahs
      and deserts.   The eastern part mostly consists of a range of plateaus and high
      mountains, which in some cases reach more than 4000m above sea level. To the
      north of these mountains is Lake Tana, the biggest lake in Ethiopia and the
      source of the Blue Nile, one of the two tributaries of the Nile. The mountains
      are divided in two by the Great Rift Valley, which runs north-east to south-west,
      - and is one of the most important areas for the study of human evolution. The
      highlands are surrounded by tropical savannah and grassland regions to the west
      and south-west, while to the east lays the Danakil desert, one of the most inhospitable
      regions on earth. The south-eastern corner of Ethiopia, which borders Somalia,
      is a semi-desert plateau ranging from 300-1500 m above sea level.

    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 3'
    body: 'Ethiopian rock art is located around two main areas: around the city of
      Harar to the east and the Sidamo region to the south-west. The first group comprises
      mainly painted depictions, while the second one is characterized by a bas-relief
      technique specific only to this area. However, rock art has also been discovered
      in other areas, such as the border with Eritrea, the area near Kenya and the
      Benishangul-Gumuz region, a lowland area along the border with Sudan. As research
      increases, it is likely that more rock art sites will be discovered throughout
      the country. In addition to these engravings and paintings, Ethiopia is also
      known for its decorated stelae, tall stone obelisks that are usually engraved
      with culturally and religiously important symbols. One of these places is Tiya,
      a burial place declared a World Heritage Site which has 32 richly decorated
      stelae. Although not strictly rock art in the traditional sense, they nevertheless
      represent one of the most interesting group of archaeological remains in the
      south of Ethiopia and demonstrate similar techniques to some of the engraved
      depictions.'

    title: Research history
    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 4'
    body: Ethiopian rock art has played a key role in the Horn of Africa research,
      and the studies undertaken in this country have structured the chronologies,
      styles and interpretations of the whole region. Research started as early as
      the mid-1930s when the Abbé Henri Breuil proposed a classification of Ethiopian
      rock art through the study of the Porc-Epic and Genda-Biftou sites. This proposal
      stated a progressive evolution in eight steps from naturalism to schematism,
      and set the interpretative framework for succeeding decades. Breuil’s ideas
      were generally followed by John Desmond Clark in his synthesis of the rock art
      in the Horn of Africa in 1954, and they also appear in the work of Paolo Graziosi
      (1964). During the 1960s, research was carried out by Francis Anfray in the
      Sidamo area and by Gerard Bailloud near Harar, where a report made for the Ethiopian
      government informed about the existence of around ten rock art sites in the
      same area.

    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 5'
    body: Rock art research in Ethiopia has traditionally included the term Ethiopian-Arabian
      style, coined in 1971 by Červiček to show the similarities between the depictions
      found in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The existence of this
      style is currently the paradigm used in most rock art interpretations of the
      region, although some concerns have been raised due to its too generic characteristics,
      which can be found in many other parts of Africa.  The 1990s and 2000s have
      seen a remarkable increase of rock art research in the country, with the renewal
      of studies in the main areas and the beginning of research in the regions of
      Tigray and Benishangul-Gumuz.

    title: Themes
    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 6'
    body: Cattle and cattle-related depictions are the main subject of Ethiopian rock
      art, regardless of their relative chronology. The oldest depictions (based on
      Červiček’s works) are of humpless cows, while in the late stages of rock art
      humped cows and camels appear. Goats, sheep and dogs are very occasionally depicted,
      and unlike the Saharan rock art, wild animals such as giraffes and antelopes
      are scarce. Figures of cattle appear alone or in herds, and the depictions of
      cows with calves are a fairly common motif not only in Ethiopia but in the whole
      Horn of Africa.

    body: The other main group of depictions is of anthropomorphs, which are usually
      schematic and often distributed in rows. In some cases, the tendency to schematism
      is so pronounced that human figures are reduced to an H-like shape. Sometimes,
      human figures are represented as warriors, carrying weapons and on occasion
      fighting against other humans or big felines. Along with these figurative themes,
      geometric signs are very common in Ethiopian rock art, including groups of dots
      and other motifs that have been interpreted as symbols associated with groups
      that historically lived in the region.

      Again, differences in techniques are also evident: while depictions in the Harar
      region are mainly paintings, in Sidamo many figures are engraved in a very singular
      way, lowering the area around the figures to achieve a bas-relief effect. The
      clear differences between the Sidamo engravings (known as the Chabbé-Galma group)
      and those of the Harar (the Laga Oda-Sourré group) have led to criticisms about
      the perceived uniformity of the *Ethiopian-Arabian* style.'

    title: Chronology
    title_internal: 'Ethiopia: country, chapter 9'
    body: As is the case with most African rock art, absolute dates for depictions
      based on radiocarbon techniques are scarce, and therefore most of the chronological
      framework of Ethiopian rock art has to rely on the analysis of figures, superimpositions,
      parallels with depictions of better known areas and other indirect dating methods.
      In Ethiopian rock art it is generally assumed that the oldest depictions could
      be dated to the mid-third millennium BC, according to parallels with other Saharan
      rock art. As aforementioned, the so-called Ethiopian-Arabian style shows an
      evolution from naturalism to schematism, with an older group (Sourré-Hanakiya)
      showing strong similarities with rock art in Egypt, Sudan and Libya. A second,
      progressively schematic group (Dahtami) would last until the end of the first
      millennium BC. This date is supported by the appearance of camels and humped
      cows (zebus), which were introduced in the region at the end of the second half
      of the 1st millennium BC. The last stages of Ethiopian rock art relating to
      camel, warriors and geometric depictions can be considered to belong to the
      historical period, in some cases reaching very near to the present day.
