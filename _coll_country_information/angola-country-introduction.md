    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 1'
    body: 'Angola is a country located in the south-west of Africa, stretching from
      the Atlantic Ocean to the centre of the continent.  Angolan rock art consists
      both of  engravings and paintings, and is mostly located relatively near to
      the coast, although some sites have also been documented in the easternmost
      part of the country, near the border with Zambia.  Depictions are very varied,
      representing animals, human figures and geometric signs, in many cases grouped
      in hunting or war scenes.  In some cases, firearms appear represented, showing
      the period of contact with Europeans from the 1500s onwards.  '

    title: Geography and rock art distribution
    title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 2'
    body: Angola has a variety of climates.  The flat coastal plain ranges between
      25 and 150 km in width, and is a semiarid region covered by scrub, turning into
      sand dunes to the south, near Namibia.  The coastal region abruptly gives way
      to a series of mountains and escarpments divided  by the Cuanza River.  The
      northern part has an average height of 500 m, but the southern region is far
      higher, with the peaks occasionally exceeding 2,300 m.  This mountainous region
      is in fact a transitional area between the coastal plain and the great central
      plateau of Africa.  This plateau dominates Angola’s geography with an altitude
      from 1,200 to 1,800 m, and consists of a region of plains and low hills with
      a tropical climate.  The climate becomes drier to the south and wetter to the
      north, where a wide region of the country can be defined as rainforest.

    title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 3'
    body: 'Rock art in Angola is primarily located in the coastal region, from north
      to south, with a clear concentration in its central area.  However some rock
      art sites have also been discovered in the interior of the country, especially
      in its east-central region, and therefore this concentration in the coast could
      be explained by different research priorities in the past. Although both paintings
      and engravings are present in Angolan rock art, the latter seem to be predominant
      near the coast, while paintings are more common in the interior and to the south.  '

    title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 4'
    body: 'Although there are some references in Portuguese chronicles from the 1500s
      and 1600s  which could correspond to rock art paintings, the first clear mention
      of a rock art site was made in 1816 with research only starting in 1939, when
      José Redinha published the first news about engravings of Angola.  Since then,
      research was intermittent until the 1950s, when the important site of Tchitundu-Hulu
      was studied and published.  The relevance of Tchitundu-Hulu attracted the attention
      of important scholars such as Desmond Clark and the  Abbé Breuil, who along
      with Portuguese researchers contextualized Angolan rock art within the continent.  Research
      increased significantly over the next two decades, but during the 1980s political
      instability gave way to a period of stagnation until the 1990s, when new researchers
      began comprehensive surveys and organised the available rock art information.  '

    title: 'Themes '
    title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 5'
    body: 'The rock art in Angola has a wide variety of styles and themes, depending
      on the region and the chronology.  The oldest images are painted or engraved
      geometric symbols and anthropomorphic figures.  More recent depictions include
      axes, spears and firearms.  The latest period of the Angolan rock art includes
      complex scenes of war and hunting, and in a number of cases human figures carried
      on a palanquin-like structure.  Although schematic figures are widespread throughout
      the country, they are predominant in the south-west where most of the sites
      have been compared to those in the Central Africa Schematic Art zone, with parallels
      in Malawi and Mozambique.  In the west-central area of Angola, in addition to
      the schematic symbols and animals, images of men holding weapons, fighting and
      hunting are common, including warriors holding firearms which make reference
      to the first contact with Europeans by the 16th century.  Near the north-west
      coast, some of the paintings and engravings have been related to objects used
      in religious ceremonies –wooden statuettes or decorated pot lids.  In particular,
      a close association has been establish between rock art depictions and the so-called
      Cabinda pot lids, which have different carved symbols—animals, objects, human
      figures—acting as a shared visual language.  '

    title: " Chronology"
    title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 6'
    body: 'As is so often the case with rock art, the dating of images is complex
      due to the absence of direct correlations between rock art depictions and well
      contextualised archaeological remains.  Some of the sites with rock art have
      been excavated showing dates of the 7th millennium BC, but the relationship
      with the rock art is unclear.  In the Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume site, the excavation
      at the cave provided a 1st millennium BC date, and the only radiocarbon date
      taken from the pigments at this site provided a date of the 1st century AD,
      which corresponds with other dates of the same style in Central Africa.  The
      second tool for assigning a chronology is the analysis of the subject matter
      represented in the rock art depictions: the presence of metal objects, for example,
      would imply a date of the 1st millennium AD onwards, when this material was
      introduced.  Whereas, depictions featuring images of firearms would date from
      the 16th century onwards.  The end of the rock art tradition has been associated
      with the presence of Europeans but was probably progressive as the control of
      the region by the Portuguese grew during the 17th and 18th centuries.  '
