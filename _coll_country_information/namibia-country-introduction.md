    body: "Rock art is found across the country from the southern border almost to
      the northern border, although rock art sites are scarce in the far north.  The
      majority of known rock art sites are found in the rocky and mountainous areas
      forming the escarpment edge in the west of the country.  Particular concentrations
      of rock art are found in the west-centre of the country, north of the edge of
      the Namib’s coastal sand sea.  Namibia’s most well-known rock art locales are
      clustered in this area, among them the Brandberg (also known as Dâures) and
      Erongo mountains and the Spitzkoppe peaks, as well as the well-known engraved
      rock art complex at  Twyfelfontein | /Ui-//aes.  \n\nAround  20km wide, the
      almost circular granitic intrusion of the Brandberg contains Namibia’s highest
      point  at over 2,500 ft., and around 1,000 rock art sites, with around 50,000
      individual figures recorded. These include both paintings and engravings but
      paintings form the majority. The Erongo mountains, a similar but less compact
      formation around 120km to the south-east, contain a further 80 sites and 50km
      to the west of this, the Spitzkoppe peaks, a group of granite inselbergs, has
      a smaller concentration of known sites with 37 so far recorded.  Painting sites
      are most often found on vertical surfaces in rock shelters or the sides of granitic
      boulders,  while engravings may survive in more exposed environments such as
      on boulders, often dolerite or sandstone.   \n\nThe most well-known of the engraving
      sites is that of Twyfelfontein | /Ui-//aes, around 50 km north of the Brandberg.
      The rock art complex here is dominated by collections of engraved images, though
      some paintings are also present.  With well over 2,000 individual images, the
      Twyfelfontein engravings form the largest known discrete collection of engraved
      rock art in Southern Africa.   \n"

    body: 'The first published mention of rock art in south-western Africa may be
      that of C. J. Andersson who mentioned “A strange tale of a rock in which the
      tracks of …animals are distinctly visible” in his 1856 book Lake Ngami.  Further
      reports came in the 1870s when the Reverend C. J. Büttner published an article
      in a South African periodical reporting rock art in the Erongo Mountains, while
      Commissioner William Coates Palgrave made a report of paintings near Dassiesfontein,
      along with some the earliest known photographs of rock art in Africa.  European
      public awareness of rock art from the region in Europe was spurred by the January
      1910 publication of an article  by Oberleutnant Hugo Jochmann featuring images
      from various sites in a German magazine.  The  first monograph on the rock art
      of the area then known as South West Africa was published in 1930 (Obermaier
      & Kühn, 1930), following further reports by officials, including the explorer
      and geographer Reinhardt Maack, who in a 1921 report first noted the existence
      of engravings at Twyfelfontein.  '

    body: "During the course of an earlier expedition, Maack had stumbled upon a singular
      painting in a Brandberg rock shelter. This image came to be well-known as the
      ‘White Lady’ of the Brandberg, after the renowned rock art researcher the Abbé
      Henri Breuil, who saw Maack’s copy of it and took a keen interest in the image.
      Eventually Breuil published a lavishly illustrated volume on the White Lady
      in 1955, which made it one of the most famous rock painting images in the world.
      \ During the 1940s and 50s Breuil also explored and published on rock art sites
      elsewhere in the Brandberg and Erongo mountains.  \n\nErnst Scherz, who had
      acted as a guide for Breuil, would go on to conduct extensive documentation
      work throughout the country as part of  the comprehensive research project investigating
      the archaeology of South West Africa run by the University of Cologne and sponsored
      by the Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft.  Beginning in 1963, this resulted in
      the publications of Scherz’s three-volume opus *Felsbilder in Sudwest-Afrika*
      in 1970, 1975 and 1986, containing site by site descriptions and classifications
      of painting and engraving sites throughout modern Namibia, along with discussion
      of theme and context.  The Cologne programme also supported the work of several
      other researchers, including the designer and artist Harald Pager, whose meticulous
      work recording rock paintings in South Africa’s Drakensberg had already gained
      him recognition in the field of rock art research. From 1977, Pager began a
      seven year project of recording painted rock art sites in the Brandberg, documenting
      around 43,000 individual images.  Pager’s corpus has been organised by Tilman
      Lenssen-Erz and published posthumously in the six-volume   *Rock Paintings of
      the Upper Brandberg*, as a result of which the Brandberg is one of the most
      comprehensively documented rock art regions on earth.\n"

      Erich Wendt, who between 1968 and 1970 worked at numerous sites investigating
      Late Stone Age activity in the country.  During this time, Wendt recovered seven
      slabs bearing pigment from a layer in a cave of the Huns Mountains in southern
      Namibia, which have been scientifically dated to 30,000 years ago.  Four of
      these exhibited pigmented imagery of animals including a possible rhinoceros,
      a portion of a possible zebra figure and a complete unidentified quadruped formed
      by two of the plaques fitting together.  These remain the oldest known figurative
      art in Africa.  Much further rock art recording and excavation work has been

    body: "Much of the painted rock art in Namibia may be broadly compared to the
      wider hunter-gatherer rock art oeuvre found throughout southern Africa, similar
      in theme and composition and believed to be a part of the same general tradition,
      which is generally attributed to San|Bushman¹ people and their ancestors.  Imagery
      includes scenes of human figures carrying bows and other implements, wild animals
      and unidentified shapes in different pigments.  Overall, human figures dominate
      in the paintings of Namibia, making up more than 2/3 of the painted figures,
      and where the gender can be recognised, they are more commonly male than female.
      \ Prominent painting subjects and styles in the rock art of Namibia (particularly
      the best-studied west-central region) include, at some sites, clearly delineated
      dots and patterns on human figures, a particular tradition of showing human
      figures with voluminous decorated hairstyles, and more images of giraffe and
      kudu, gemsbok and springbok antelope than in other southern African regions.
      \ Other images of animals include those of zebras, elephants, rhinoceros and
      ostriches.  More occasional motifs found include plants, cattle, sheep and handprints.
      \n\n¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher
      groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions.
      Both 'San' and 'Bushmen' are considered offensive terms by some members of these
      groups, although others have positively adopted them."

      to stylised.  Paintings found at Spitzkoppe tend to be smaller and cruder than
      others in the region, where some sites feature tableaux in many colours while
      others are entirely monochrome.   While the majority of rock  paintings in Namibia
      seem to conform to the hunter-gatherer style, there are also some examples of
      finger paintings in the Brandberg and northern Namibia, which are much more
      schematic in style and appear to belong to a different tradition altogether.
      \ \n\nAs with much southern African rock art, the colours visible today may
      not always accurately reflect the original look as some pigments.  This is particularly
      true for those used for pale colours or white, which may be ‘fugitive’, meaning
      that over time they fade or wash away faster than the more stable pigments around
      them, leaving gaps which were once coloured.  Chemical analyses have shown that
      a major binder (used to coalesce dry pigment powder) for painted rock art in
      Namibia was blood, and in some cases egg white.   \n"

    title: Interpretation
    title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 11'
    body: "Namibian rock paintings, and most engravings, have largely been interpreted
      in the vein largely espoused by  researchers over the past 30 years.  This postulates
      that much of this rock art reflects the experience of San|Bushman shamans entering
      trance states and that rather than being scenes from daily life, the depictions
      of animals and activities are highly symbolic within San|Bushman cosmology,
      with images acting as reservoirs of spiritual power.  This avenue of interpretation
      originates largely from the study of rock art in South Africa and Lesotho.  While
      it appears broadly applicable here, the fact that direct attributions to known
      cultural groups in this area are difficult somewhat hinders direct comparisons
      with Namibian rock art.  While hunter-gatherer rock painting production in South
      Africa was practiced until the recent past, it appears to have ceased in Namibia
      around a thousand  years ago and modern San|Bushman groups in the Kalahari area
      have no tradition of rock art production.   \n\nAdditionally, hundreds of miles
      and different geographical environments separate the rock art centres of north-western
      Namibia from those in neighbouring countries. This is particularly apparent
      in the differences in terms of animal subject matter, with the numerous depictions
      of gemsbok and springbok, explicable by the rock art creators being semi-desert
      dwellers where gemsbok and springbok are found locally though largely absent
      from rock art elsewhere in southern Africa, where these animals are not found.
      \n"

    body: "Other differences are found in style and emphasis: the frequency with which
      giraffe feature in Namibian paintings and engravings contrasts with the South
      African rock art, where the emphasis is more on the eland antelope.  This has
      led some to propose that the giraffe, similarly, must have held a particular
      symbolic meaning for the painters of the region.  Based on associated imagery,
      placement of the rock art sites, and some ethnography (written records of insights
      from contemporary San|Bushman culture compiled by anthropologists) it has been
      suggested that giraffes may have been linked with rain in local belief systems,
      with some Namibian rock painting sites are associated specifically with rainmaking
      or healing activities. \n\nWhile the more naturalistic examples of engravings
      are thought to have also been produced by ancient hunter-gatherers, as with
      the paintings, it has been suggested that some geometric engravings were produced
      \ by herding people, possibly ancestral Khoenkhoen, perhaps in relation to initiation
      rites.  Schematic finger paintings have also been attributed to pastoralist
      people.  All attributions are tentative, however, because the majority of the
      art is thought to be many hundreds of years old and the historical distinctions
      between hunter-gatherers and herders is by no means clear-cut in the archaeological
      record.\n"

    title: Chronology
    title_internal: 'Namibia: country, chapter 13'
    body: "The pieces from the cave Wendt excavated (named ‘Apollo 11 Cave’ after
      the moon mission which took place during the period of the excavation work)
      are not thought to have fallen from a cave wall but were made on loose rock
      pieces.  The only parietal art (on a fixed rock surface) dated from excavated
      deposits in Namiba so far consists of pieces of painted granite from the largest
      painted shelter in the Brandberg, one of which, found in a sedimentary layer
      radiocarbon dated to around 2,700 years ago, had clearly fallen from an exposed
      rock surface into which researchers were able to refit it. Aside from this,
      estimates at the age of rock art are based on superimposition, patination and
      associated archaeological finds. \n\nBased on archaeological evidence, it is
      thought that the majority of the fine-line hunter-gatherer rock art in the Brandberg
      area was produced between around 4,000 and 2,000 years ago, with the painting
      tradition in the wider region starting as much as 6,000 years ago. This ceased
      sometime after the introduction of small domestic stock to the area, although
      not immediately, as fine-line paintings of sheep and paintings and engravings
      of cattle testify.   Across central Namibia, there appears to be a particularly
      strong correspondence of finds relating to paintings—such as grinding equipment
      and pigments—with dated layers from the 1st millennium BC.\n"

    body: 'Engravings are more difficult to obtain dates for scientifically. Superimpositioning
      and other physical factors can serve to indicate which styles of image are more
      recent with both paintings and engravings. For example, in the Brandberg, monochrome
      tableaux appear older than detailed polychrome depictions of individuals, and
      certain images, such as those of zebras, are thought to be relatively late.  Among
      engravings of central Namibia, a certain style of hoof print appears to overlie
      some figurative images, leading researchers to believe them younger.  Overall
      it is thought that the engraving and painting traditions were concurrent, with
      some clear parallels in style, but that engraving probably lasted for several
      hundred years as a tradition after painting ceased.  '
