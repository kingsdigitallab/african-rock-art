    body: Rock art in Uganda is mostly concentrated in the eastern part of the country,
      but more broadly sits within a regional belt of geometric rock art spanning
      East and Central Africa. It is mainly geometric in nature and includes both
      paintings (red and white being the most common pigment) and engravings; it comprises
      a basic and recurring repertoire of shapes including circular, rectangular,
      sausage, dot and lines. Concentric circles with rays emanating from them are
      a unique feature of Ugandan rock art.

      borders with Kenya to the east, South Sudan in the north, Democratic Republic
      of Congo in the west, and Rwanda and Tanzania in the south. It sits in the heart
      of the Great Lakes region, flanked by Lake Edward, Lake Albert and Lake Victoria,
      the latter being the second largest inland freshwater lake in the world, containing
      numerous islands. While much of its border is lakeshore, the country is landlocked.  Predominantly
      plateau, Uganda is cradled by mountains with Margherita peak (5,199m) on Mount
      Stanley the third highest point in Africa.

    body: |-
      The first documentation of rock art in Uganda occurred in 1913 (Teso Report) at Nyero, a painted rock shelter of the Later Iron Age period. After its initial recording the site was subsequently cited in a 1945 excavation report (Harwich, 1961) and meticulously noted by J.C.D Lawrance during the 1950s. Only a small number of studies of Ugandan rock art rock art have been published (Wayland 1938; Lawrance 1953; Posnansky 1961; Morton 1967; Chaplin 1974), with early analyses being predominantly descriptive and highly speculative.

      The first major publications on Ugandan rock art emerged in the 1960s (Posnansky 1961; Morton 1967; Chaplin 1974) with rock art researchers proposing that the geometric and non-representational depictions served a documentary purpose of identifying cultural groups such as hunter-gatherers, cultivators or pastoralists. During this decade researchers attempted to place the rock art in a chronological framework, tying it to broader archaeological sequences. Political instability greatly impeded research during the 1970s and 1980s, although Chaplin’s thesis and in-depth survey on prehistoric rock art of Lake Victoria was published posthumously in 1974.

      tradition, the red geometrics include images painted in red and applied with
      the fingertip; the most common motifs comprise concentric circles, concentric
      circles with radiating lines, dots, U-shapes, dotted, straight, horizontal and
      vertical lines and interlinked lines. Other motifs and shapes are described

      concentric circles with internal radiating spokes, lines and dots. Proportionally,
      there are fewer engravings than paintings but as Namono (2010) has observed
      this may reflect a research bias rather than an actual disparity.\n"

    body: |-
      Attempts to understand the chronology of Ugandan rock in the 1960s were based on sequences focusing on pigments used in paintings. Lawrance proposed that yellow paintings were the oldest; followed by orange, red, purple, red and white; white and dirty white were the latest in the sequence. It is highly problematic developing sequences based on pigments because of the ways in which they chemically react with particular surfaces, other pigments and the natural elements, which can compromise the integrity of the pigment. However, there appears to be a consistency (across East and Central Africa) that suggests red and white geometric paintings are the oldest and have been in existence for millennia.

      Initially thought to be the work of San Bushmen of southern Africa, archaeological, genetic and ethnographic evidence has subsequently attributed the paintings to the Batwa people, a cultural group who are today found in small groups near the Rwanda/Uganda border. If it is accepted that the geometric imagery was made by these hunter-gatherers then the rock art of Uganda probably dates from between 12,000 to 1,000 years ago.

      another site at Kakoro) has dated the paintings to between 5,000 and 1,600 years
      ago. It has been proposed that rock shelters were used by semi-nomadic peoples
      engaged in animal herding, which they used as reference points in the landscape.
      Generally positioned away from flat land, they may have served to direct herders
      of cattle and/or goats towards paths and water.

    title_internal: 'Uganda: country, chapter 11'
    body: A recent comprehensive study (Namono, 2010) of the potential meaning of
      geometric art in Uganda looked at the ways in which the geometric shapes in
      the rock art can be associated with the ethnographies of hunter-gatherers of
      the region. The approach proposed that the symbolism of geometric rock art derives
      from a gendered forest worldview. The forest is pivotal to hunter/gatherer cosmology
      in this region, whereby it plays a central role in cultural production and reproduction
      over time and is regarded as both male and female. The forest is not only a
      source of subsistence and well-being but informs their identity and the rock
      art reflects these complex concepts.

    body: It is difficult to determine when rock art sites were last used, and in
      some cases, such as at Nyero, sites are still in use by local peoples with offerings
      being made and sites associated with rain-making rituals. However, the advent
      of colonialism influenced such traditions bringing a change in the way the forest
      was venerated, used and conceptualised.
