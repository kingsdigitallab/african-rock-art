    title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 1'
    body: The rock art of Egypt was largely unknown outside of the region until the
      beginning of the 20th century. The rock paintings and engravings of Egypt feature
      a range of subjects and styles, including domestic cattle, wild animals, humans,
      boat images and inscriptions. Much of the rock art appears to date from within
      the last 8,000 years. However, earlier Palaeolithic engravings have also been
      found near the Nile, suggesting a longer time frame for the practice. The majority
      of Egypt’s most famous rock art, including the ‘Cave of Swimmers’, is found
      in the desert in the far south-west of the country.

      creation of the Suez Canal in 1869, contained Africa’s only direct physical
      connection to Eurasia. The country’s most prominent geographical feature, the
      river Nile, flows from the highlands of Ethiopia and Central Africa into the
      Mediterranean, dividing the eastern portion of the Sahara into the Western and
      Eastern Deserts, with the Sinai Peninsula to the east.

    body: |-
      The presence of rock art in Egypt has been noticed by European scholars since the early 19th century. Geographically isolated from the bulk of rock art in the country, the paintings and engravings of Gilf Kebir and Jebel Uweinat were first catalogued in the 1920s by the Egyptian explorers and public figures Hassanein Bey and Prince Kemal el Dine, and thereafter by renowned early twentieth century explorers and ethnographers such as László Almásy, Leo Frobenius, Ralph Bagnold and Abbé Breuil, whose expeditions helped bring Saharan rock art into wider public consciousness.

      Hans Winkler’s seminal *Rock Drawings of Southern Upper Egypt* (1938-9) was one of the first regional catalogues and remains a pre-eminent review of finds. Further cataloguing of rock art images and sites in the southern Nile valley took place at the time of the construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s. Where rock art historically was part of larger archaeological research in the area, in recent years it has been subject to more direct and rigorous study which will contribute to a better understanding of chronologies and relationships.

    body: In desert areas, recognisably stylised Pharaonic-period inscriptions and
      engravings from between 3,100 and 30 BC can be found on rock faces, particularly
      at oases and quarry sites such as Kharga Oasis and Wadi Hammamat in the Western
      and Eastern deserts. There is also rock art from later periods like that at
      Matna el-Barqa in the Western Desert hinterland, where both Pharaonic and later
      Coptic inscriptions mix with images of gods and horsemen. Earlier examples of
      engraved rock art may be found in the Nile valley, in what is now southern Egypt
      and northern Sudan, linked to progenitors of ancient Egyptian cultures, most
      particularly the people of the Naqada Periods (4,000-3,100 BC). This art is
      characterised by frequent depictions on pottery of river boats, which occur
      in much of the rock art near the Nile, and include, pecked on a boulder at Nag
      el-Hamdulab near Aswan, what is considered the first known depiction of a Pharaoh,
      on just such a boat. Also prevalent in these areas are numerous engravings of
      animals and human figures.

    title: Chronology
    title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 6'
    body: Certainly, not all rock art found in Egypt has direct links to Pharaonic
      cultures. Recently, the rock art at Qurta, south of Edfu, of naturalistic outline
      engravings of ancient aurochs (ancestors of domestic cattle), were dated reliably
      to the Palaeolithic Period, between 16,000 and 15,000 years ago, making them
      the oldest known rock art in northern Africa. Between the eighth and fourth
      millennia BC, Egypt’s climate was generally temperate, interrupted only briefly
      by dry spells, until the increasing aridity thereafter concentrated life in
      the Eastern Sahara around the river’s banks.

    body: This development fostered both ancient Egyptian culture and isolated populations
      of animals elsewhere driven out of their environments by encroaching desert,
      some of which, like crocodiles, are represented in the rock engravings found
      along the alluvial plains. Engravings of wild fauna continue to be uncovered,
      such as that recently found near the Farafra Oasis, with depictions of giraffe
      and antelope scratched into the rock face. In a cave nearby, alongside engraved
      lion paw prints, are blown-pigment negative paintings of human hands.

    body: Some of Egypt’s most striking and famous rock art is found far from the
      Nile at Gilf Kebir, a vast sandstone plateau in the desert near the Libyan border.
      As elsewhere in the Sahara, there are frequent depictions of domestic cattle,
      people and wild animals. Like most rock art, the paintings and engravings here
      are hard to date accurately but may refer to the ‘Bovidian Period’ (Pastoral
      Period) rock art of the wider Sahara, typified by paintings and engravings of
      cattle and people (Huyge, 2009). However, the scholarly community recognises
      the inherent difficulty of formulating conclusions of direct links with wider
      rock art practices. Some evidence of pastoralists in the area means that this
      rock art could have been made as early as the fifth millennium BC and are thus
      possibly contemporaneous with Predynastic Egyptian cultures, but not necessarily
      connected (Riemer, 2013).

    title: Interpretation
    title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 9'
    body: The motivation behind producing these images remains elusive. Where a particular
      cosmology is better known, it can be speculated, such as the Nile boat paintings
      have been suggested to evoke funerary beliefs and practices. If nothing else,
      the cattle paintings of Gilf Kebir demonstrate the importance of cattle in the
      pastoralist culture that produced them. Despite still being relatively little
      known, the ‘mystique’ behind rock art has cultivated popular curiosity, in particular
      in Gilf Kebir’s famous ‘Cave of Swimmers’. This is a shallow rock shelter featuring
      many painted human figures in strange contortions, as if swimming – images which
      have captured the popular imagination, with their glimpse of life in Egypt millennia
      before the Pharaohs and their hints at a watery Sahara.
