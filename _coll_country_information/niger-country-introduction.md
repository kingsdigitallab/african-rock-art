    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 1'
    body: Niger is geographically diverse, having both the Sahel (savannah) and the
      Sahara (desert). The majority of the country’s rock art – made up predominantly
      of engravings – is located in the northern desert area, in and around the Aïr
      Mountains, where some of the art is thought to be several thousand years old.
      The Djado Plateau in the north-east is also rich in art that includes both paintings
      and engravings. One of the most celebrated sites of rock engraving is at a place
      called Dabous, to the west of the mountains. Here, two life-size giraffe were
      carved on the top of an outcrop, and may be up to 6,000 years old. Other notable
      areas for engravings are Iwellene in the northern Aïr Mountains, where some
      of the art is thought to be several thousand years old, as well the sites of
      Tanakom and Tagueit in the south-eastern Aïr Mountains, where engravings are
      located on the sides of two wadis (dry riverbeds).

      countries – in particular, between the so-called Libyan Warrior art found in
      the Aïr Mountains and the rock engravings of the Adrar des Iforas in Mali. Stylistic
      similarities also exist with some of the art of the Tadrart (Acacus) and in
      south-east Algeria. Further associations have been made between the Early Hunter
      art of the Djado Plateau and art in south-west Libya and south-east Algeria.
      Equally, similarities have been observed with the Tazina-style engravings in
      south-western Algeria and south-eastern Morocco.

    body: Consisting predominantly of engravings, the majority of depictions in this
      region fall within the so-called Libyan Warrior period or style of art, dating
      from 1,500–3,000 years ago, characterised by forward-facing figures with metal
      weapons and horses. Approximately 1,000 engravings of warriors have been recorded
      from the Aïr Mountains in Niger, as well as the Adrar des Iforas in bordering
      Mali. Based on investigations into the garments worn, accessories, headdresses
      and weaponry, and by studying the placement and superimposition of images, it
      has been proposed that there are two main stages of this Libyan Warrior rock
      art. The oldest is linked to a pastoral economy based on cattle-rearing, when
      metal had been introduced to the region and the use of the spear took over from
      the traditional bow. This region also hosts images of wild animals such as Barbary
      sheep and ostrich, as well as cattle.

    body: The number of cattle depictions is small, but particular images of calves
      attached to a lead can be compared stylistically with images of cattle in Tassili
      n’Ajjer, Algeria. Moreover, Henri Lhote noted the resemblance between these
      rock art depictions and the husbandry practices of the present day Wodaabe people
      of Niger, who use a similar calf rope. The calf rope (a long rope comprising
      loops within which the heads of the calves are secured) is both practical and
      symbolic, ensuring the cows always return to their home camp, while also physically
      dividing the camp into male and female halves. It is interesting to note the
      close relationship between the rock art of regions that today are politically
      discrete.

    title: History of rock art discovery in Niger
    title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 7'
    body: Until relatively recently rock art research has been sporadic in Niger.
      In the 1920s Major Gen. Francis Rodd, a British explorer and army officer, made
      two great expeditions into the Sahara. He was the first person to make a serious
      study of the Tuareg and documented some of the rock art in the Aïr Mountains.
      Subsequently, French colonial officers noted some sites around 1960. However,
      it was French archaeologist Henri Lhote who undertook major recording programmes
      throughout the 1960s and 1970s to document, trace and publish several thousand
      engravings. Very little information is known relating the rock art to known
      cultural groups, either past or present. Most of the sites were not habitation
      sites, and were probably only occasionally visited by nomadic societies in the
      past, so very little (if any) archaeological evidence remains. Most of the art
      predates the residence of the Tuareg, who now inhabit this area and who appear
      to have no direct connections with the art. The Tuareg recognise old script
      which sometimes accompanies images as it closely resembles their own writing,
      *Tifinagh*; however, it is incomprehensible to them if it is more than 100 years
      old.

    body: Although the Bovidian Period is sparsely represented in comparison to other
      rock art regions, both on the Djado Plateau and the Aïr Mountains, this period
      can probably be dated to between 7,000 and 4,000 years ago. A few cattle are
      depicted in a similar fashion to the big game of the Early Hunter Period, which
      raises the question of whether the nomadic cattle-herding culture emerged from
      a hunting lifestyle, or at least rapidly succeeded it.

    body: Engravings in the Tazina style are found on the Djado Plateau and have been
      likened to those in south-eastern Morocco. While dates in Niger are not generally
      agreed, the Tazina period in Morocco is dated from c.5,000–2,000 BC.

    body: Consisting predominantly of rock engravings and found in the Aïr Mountains,
      the Horse Period and Libyan Warrior Period date from around 3,000–1,500 years
      ago. Depictions are of horses with so-called Libyan Warriors, with metal weapons
      or with chariots and charioteers. Human figures, which often appear with horses,
      were sometimes depicted with elaborate apparel; others were drawn with stylized
      bodies consisting of two triangles joined at the apex. Wild animals such as
      Barbary sheep and ostrich, as well as cattle, appear in this art. Art of the
      Horse Period is not widely represented in the Djado Plateau, suggesting that
      Berber groups did not reach the region in any great numbers – but it has been
      proposed that certain peculiarities of style may suggest an influence from Aïr.

    body: A small number of engravings from the Camel Period occur on the Djado Plateau,
      but as camels were introduced to the Sahara up to 2,000 years ago, the relative
      lack of depictions suggests that the plateau was scarcely frequented during
      this hyper-arid period.
