    title: Introduction
    title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 1'
    body: Algeria is Africa’s largest country geographically and has long been noted
      for its rich concentrations of rock art, particularly in the Tassili n’Ajjer,
      inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. More than 15,000 paintings
      and engravings, some of which date back up to 12,000 years, provide unique insights
      into the environmental, social, cultural and economic changes in the country
      across a period of 10,000 or more years. The area is particularly famous for
      its Round Head paintings, first described and published in the 1930s by French
      archaeologist Henry Lhote.

    title: Geography
    title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 2'
    body: Algeria is situated in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered on the
      west by Morocco and on the east by Tunisia and Libya, with a long Mediterranean
      coastline to the north. The Atlas Mountains cross Algeria east to west along
      the Mediterranean coast. The northern portion of the country is an area of mountains,
      valleys, and plateaus, but more than 80% of the country falls within the Sahara
      Desert. Rock art is located in the Algerian Maghreb and the Hoggar Mountains
      but the richest zone of rock art is located in the mountain range of Tassili
      n'Ajjer, a vast plateau in the south-east of the country. Water and sand erosion
      have carved out a landscape of thin passageways, large arches, and high-pillared
      rocks, described by Lhote as 'forests of stone'.

    title: Research history
    title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 3'
    body: |-
      Rock art in Algeria, notably the engravings in South Oran, has been the subject of European study since 1863. Notable surveys were made by A. Pomel (1893-1898), Stéphane Gsell (1901-1927), G. B. M. Flamand (1892-1921), Leo Frobenius and Hugo Obermaier (1925), Henri Breuil (1931-1957), L. Joleaud (1918-1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (1935-1955). Henri Lhote visited the area in 1955 and 1964, completing previous research and adding new descriptions included in a major publication on the area in 1970.

      The rock art of the Tassili region was introduced to Western eyes as a result of visits and sketches made by French legionnaires, in particular a Lt. Brenans during the 1930s. On several of his expeditions, Lt. Brenans took French archaeologist Henri Lhote who went on to revisit sites in Algeria between 1956-1970 documenting and recording the images he found. Regrettably, some previous methods of recording and/or documenting have caused damage to the vibrancy and integrity of the images.

    title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 4'
    body: The earliest pieces of rock art are engraved images reflecting a past vibrant
      fertile environment teeming with life and includes elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus
      and fish as well as numerous predators, giraffe, and plains animals such as
      antelope and gazelle. When human figures are depicted in this period they are
      very small in stature and hold throwing sticks or axes. More than simply hunting
      scenes, they are likely to reflect people’s own place within their environment
      and their relationship with it.

    title: Round Head Period
    title_internal: 'Algeria: country, chapter 5'
    body: The area is especially famous for its Round Head paintings. Thought to be
      up to 9,000 years old, some of these paintings are the largest found on the
      African continent, measuring up to 13 feet in height. The Round Head period
      comprises depictions of figures with round, featureless heads and formless bodies,
      often appearing to be ‘floating’. Some features or characteristics of Round
      Head paintings found on the Tassili plateau are unique to the area, and the
      depiction of certain motifs may have held special significance locally, making
      particular sites where they occur the locus of rites, ritual or ceremonial activity.
      The majority of animal depictions are mouflon (wild mountain sheep) and antelope,
      but they are represented only in static positions and not as part of a hunting
      scene.

    body: The subsequent Pastoral Period, from around 7,500-4,000 years ago, portrays
      a very different world to the preceding ethereal Round Head period and coincides
      with the transition from a temperate Sahara towards aridification. Images are
      stylistically varied, which may attest to the movement of different cultural
      groups. Depictions now include domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, goats
      and dogs; scenes portray herders, men hunting with bows, and representations
      of camp life with women and children – in essence, scenes that reference more
      settled communities.

    body: |-
      Desertification across the Sahara required new methods of traversing and utilising the landscape; depictions of horses (often with riders) and of chariots indicate this change. Horse-drawn chariots are often depicted at a ‘flying’ gallop and are likely to have been used for hunting rather than warfare.

      Libyan-Berber script, used by ancestral Berber peoples, started to appear in association with images. However, the meaning of this juxtaposition of text and image remains an enigma, as it is indecipherable to modern day Tuareg.
