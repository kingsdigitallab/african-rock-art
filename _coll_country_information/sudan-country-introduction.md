    title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 1'
    body: 'Sudan''s known rock art mainly consists of paintings and engravings on
      exposed rock surfaces and rock shelters, largely of animals, human figures and
      ancient river boats. Most of the published rock art is found in disparate geographical
      areas in the northern section of the country: around the Nile valley and close
      to the country''s north-western and north-eastern borders. Images include wild
      fauna such as antelope, domestic animals like camels, and depictions of boats,
      which along with inscriptions and religious imagery can attempt to date these
      images.'

    title: Geography
    title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 2'
    body: Sudan covers nearly 2,000,000 km² and is geographically diverse, dominated
      in the north by the desert of the southern Sahara and divided by the River Nile,
      which flows north from the capital city of Khartoum at the confluence of the
      Blue and White Niles and is joined by the Atbara River in the east. East of
      the Nile is the arid Nubian Desert, which is part of the larger Sahara, flanked
      at the north east by the Red Sea Hills and at the south by clay plains. To the
      south and west of the country are semi-arid zones with seasonal watercourses,
      with the west dominated by the Jebel Marrah volcanic massif, and the Nuba mountain
      range near the southern border.

    title: Research history
    title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 3'
    body: Historically, rock art research in Sudan has either been incorporated into
      larger investigations of the area’s rich archaeological history, or, as in the
      Nubian Nile valley, the result of archaeological salvage projects, aimed at
      documenting and conserving archaeological sites and artefacts in advance of
      engineered flooding events, such as the construction of the Aswan High dam in
      the 1960s and the Merowe dam in the early 2000s. This has resulted in significant
      rock art and rock gong discoveries, such as that noted near the Second Cataract
      (Žába, 1967) and more recently around the Fourth. Rock art remains vulnerable
      to damming initiatives – that at Sabu is currently under threat by the Kajbar
      Dam proposal at the Third Cataract. There is great scope for further research.

    title: Rock art types
    title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 4'
    body: |-
      The rock art of Sudan is varied across both time periods and geographical regions. Numerous pecked depictions of domestic cattle can be found in the Red Sea Hills (Pluskota, 2006) as well as depictions of both domestic and wild animals closer to the River Nile, such as those found at Jebel Gorgod in a mountainous area near Sesebi (Schiff Giorgini, 1972). Engravings, like those around the Second, Third, and Fourth Cataracts (areas of rocky rapids) are varied in subject matter and in date, ranging from Neolithic engravings of wild and domestic fauna to those with Medieval Christian imagery, for example around the Dal Cataract (Mills, 1965). These are mixed with others from about 4,000 BC onwards which may be contemporary with the Predynastic cultures and Pharaonic periods of ancient Egypt and in northern Sudan, Nubian Kerma culture (known to the ancient Egyptians as the Kingdom of Kush). These include depictions of Nile river boats and later hieroglyphic inscriptions.

      The peripatetic nature of these traceable signatures highlights the need to look beyond modern boundaries when considering ancient rock art traditions of Africa. For millennia prior to the creation of the current Egypt/Sudan border, the highway of the river allowed movement between Egypt and Nubia, the people of the region leaving their marks on a narrow area of fertile land that fostered riverine animals like crocodiles, which are occasionally depicted in the rock engravings. From the 4th millennium BC, following several temperate millennia, savannah animals like giraffe lost their habitat in the increasingly arid environments to east and west, but remain reflected in the rock engravings of what is now desert.

      The range in styles and dates for Sudanese rock art emphasises its nature, not as a particular artistic style, but as personal and cultural manipulations of a specific medium. A number of stone percussive instruments known as rock gongs, which produce a sonorous tone when struck and are often apparently associated with cattle engravings, have stimulated discussion about the uses of rock art sites as multisensory ritual venues.

    title: Chronology
    title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 5'
    body: The understanding of much of Sudanese prehistory as it relates to rock art
      remains subject to debate. Some of the best-preserved and most varied rock art
      of Sudan’s desert regions is situated only metres from the Egyptian border in
      the far north-west corner of the country, in a valley of Jebel Uweinat – the
      enormous sandstone and granite outcrop which serves as a boundary between Egypt,
      Sudan and Libya. Numerous paintings and engravings are found here, including
      images of wild animals, such as giraffe and antelope, humans, dogs and many
      cattle. Some of these paintings have been compared with other styles of rock
      art in the wider Sahara, including the later Pastoral Period (Muzzolini, 1995).
      Others have proposed that a different set of paintings in these sites may be
      older, with a stylistic link (although fragile) with the Round Head Period (Van
      Noten,1978). However, the scholarly community recognises the inherent difficulty
      of formulating conclusions of direct links with wider rock art practices. In
      areas around the Nile, where there are similar animal engravings, rock art is
      also from a wide range of time periods.

    title: ''
    title_internal: 'Sudan: country, chapter 6'
    body: 'Ascribing dates to rock art like that at Jebel Uweinat is also uncertain
      and is more difficult than dating images such as the depictions of Nile river
      boats or later Christian cross engravings like those found near the Third Cataract,
      where similar motifs are replicated on contemporary pottery and corroborated
      elsewhere in the archaeological record. Occasionally rock art may be found in
      a dateable stratigraphic context- a giraffe engraving at Gala Abu Ahmed in Wadi
      Howar, an ancient Nile tributary, was recently dated to before 1,200-1,300 BC
      in this way (Jesse, 2005). In general, other clues are necessary, for example
      known domestication dates: wild animal images are often superseded with depictions
      of animals like horses and camels. These were only widely known in northeast
      Africa from the second and first millennia BC respectively and are therefore
      unlikely to be older. However, this is not an exact science: examination of
      the superimpositions and levels of patination on some Nile valley cattle engravings
      show that they were made over thousands of years up to the not too distant past.
      Faced with such challenges, classifying rock art by design style, while problematic,
      can prove useful in envisioning chronology.'
