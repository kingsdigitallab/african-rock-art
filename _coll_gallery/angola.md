      body: 'Tchitundu-Hulu is the generic name for a group of four rock art sites
        located in the Namibe province on the south-west corner of Angola, by the
        edge of the Namib desert, about 120 km from the sea.  It is a semi-arid plain
        characterized by the presence of several inselbergs (isolated hills rising
        from the plain), the most important of which is Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume.  The
        group of rock art sites are surrounded by several seasonal rivers, within
        a maximum distance of 1 km.  Tchitundu-Hulu was first documented by José Camarate
        Andrade França in 1953, and since then it has become one of the most studied
        rock art sites in Angola, attracting the interest of renowned researchers
        such as  Abbé Breuil, J.  Desmond Clark and Santos Junior.  In 2014 one of
        the sites was the subject of a Masters dissertation (Caema 2014), the latest
        addition to the long term research on the site.  '

        the hill of the souls or the sacred hill- while Mulume and Mucai are translated
        as man and woman, respectively.  Therefore, the local names of the site point
        to a deep meaning within the communities that inhabited the region.  '

        there are anthropomorphs and zoomorphs, in some cases grouped in what seem
        hunting scenes.  The other two sites (the Rock of the Zebras and the Rock

      body: 'The chronology of the Tchitundu-Hulu rock art is difficult to establish,
        and it is unclear if the four sites are of the same period at all.  Theories
        based on the lithic tools dispersed throughout the area ascribed the paintings
        to an ancient time period, possibly  tens of thousands of years old.  Radiocarbon
        samples coming from the excavation of Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume showed a date
        in the early 1st millennium BC, although the relation of the archaeological
        remains and the paintings has not been proved and archaeological materials
        of a more modern period were also located.  A sample taken from the pigments
        at the site rendered a date of the beginning of the first centuries of the
        1st millennium AD.  In any case, Tchitundu-Hulu hosts some of the oldest examples
        of rock art in the country, and it has been linked to the schematic traditions
        that characterize the rock art of Central Africa, more abundant in central
        Mozambique and Malawi.  '

      body: The question of who made the engravings or paintings is another complex
        issue for the interpretation of the Tchitundu-Hulu depictions.  The harsh
        conditions of this semi-desert area probably favoured a seasonal occupation
        of the region during the rainy season.  The location of Tchitundu-Hulu at
        the edge of the desert could also have made this place a strategic site for
        the communities living in the region.  Several local groups - Kwisi, Kuvale
        - have traditionally inhabited the area, but the authorship of these engravings
        and paintings and the motives for creating them remains obscure, as does the
        purpose and cultural context of the complex images of Tchitundu-Hulu.

      body: Angola has a variety of climates.  The flat coastal plain ranges between
        25 and 150 km in width, and is a semiarid region covered by scrub, turning
        into sand dunes to the south, near Namibia.  The coastal region abruptly gives
        way to a series of mountains and escarpments divided  by the Cuanza River.  The
        northern part has an average height of 500 m, but the southern region is far
        higher, with the peaks occasionally exceeding 2,300 m.  This mountainous region
        is in fact a transitional area between the coastal plain and the great central
        plateau of Africa.  This plateau dominates Angola’s geography with an altitude
        from 1,200 to 1,800 m, and consists of a region of plains and low hills with
        a tropical climate.  The climate becomes drier to the south and wetter to
        the north, where a wide region of the country can be defined as rainforest.

      body: 'Rock art in Angola is primarily located in the coastal region, from north
        to south, with a clear concentration in its central area.  However some rock
        art sites have also been discovered in the interior of the country, especially
        in its east-central region, and therefore this concentration in the coast
        could be explained by different research priorities in the past. Although
        both paintings and engravings are present in Angolan rock art, the latter
        seem to be predominant near the coast, while paintings are more common in
        the interior and to the south.  '

      body: 'Although there are some references in Portuguese chronicles from the
        1500s and 1600s  which could correspond to rock art paintings, the first clear
        mention of a rock art site was made in 1816 with research only starting in
        1939, when José Redinha published the first news about engravings of Angola.  Since
        then, research was intermittent until the 1950s, when the important site of
        Tchitundu-Hulu was studied and published.  The relevance of Tchitundu-Hulu
        attracted the attention of important scholars such as Desmond Clark and the  Abbé
        Breuil, who along with Portuguese researchers contextualized Angolan rock
        art within the continent.  Research increased significantly over the next
        two decades, but during the 1980s political instability gave way to a period
        of stagnation until the 1990s, when new researchers began comprehensive surveys
        and organised the available rock art information.  '

      title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 5'
      body: 'The rock art in Angola has a wide variety of styles and themes, depending
        on the region and the chronology.  The oldest images are painted or engraved
        geometric symbols and anthropomorphic figures.  More recent depictions include
        axes, spears and firearms.  The latest period of the Angolan rock art includes
        complex scenes of war and hunting, and in a number of cases human figures
        carried on a palanquin-like structure.  Although schematic figures are widespread
        throughout the country, they are predominant in the south-west where most
        of the sites have been compared to those in the Central Africa Schematic Art
        zone, with parallels in Malawi and Mozambique.  In the west-central area of
        Angola, in addition to the schematic symbols and animals, images of men holding
        weapons, fighting and hunting are common, including warriors holding firearms
        which make reference to the first contact with Europeans by the 16th century.  Near
        the north-west coast, some of the paintings and engravings have been related
        to objects used in religious ceremonies –wooden statuettes or decorated pot
        lids.  In particular, a close association has been establish between rock
        art depictions and the so-called Cabinda pot lids, which have different carved
        symbols—animals, objects, human figures—acting as a shared visual language.  '

      title: " Chronology"
      title_internal: 'Angola: country, chapter 6'
      body: 'As is so often the case with rock art, the dating of images is complex
        due to the absence of direct correlations between rock art depictions and
        well contextualised archaeological remains.  Some of the sites with rock art
        have been excavated showing dates of the 7th millennium BC, but the relationship
        with the rock art is unclear.  In the Tchitundu-Hulu Mulume site, the excavation
        at the cave provided a 1st millennium BC date, and the only radiocarbon date
        taken from the pigments at this site provided a date of the 1st century AD,
        which corresponds with other dates of the same style in Central Africa.  The
        second tool for assigning a chronology is the analysis of the subject matter
        represented in the rock art depictions: the presence of metal objects, for
        example, would imply a date of the 1st millennium AD onwards, when this material
        was introduced.  Whereas, depictions featuring images of firearms would date
        from the 16th century onwards.  The end of the rock art tradition has been
        associated with the presence of Europeans but was probably progressive as
        the control of the region by the Portuguese grew during the 17th and 18th
        centuries.  '
