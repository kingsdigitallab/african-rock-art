      body: Dabous is located in north-eastern Niger, where the Ténéré desert meets
        the slopes of the Aïr Mountains. The area has been part of the trans-Saharan
        caravan trade route traversed by the Tuareg for over two millennia, but archaeological
        evidence shows much older occupation in the region dating back 8,000 years.
        More recently, it has become known to a wider global audience for its exceptional
        rock art.

        Recorded in 1987 by French archaeologist Christian Dupuy, two remarkable life-size engravings of giraffe have generated much interest due to the size, realism and technique of the depictions. The two giraffe, thought to be one large male in front of a smaller female, were engraved on the weathered surface of a sandstone outcrop. The larger giraffe measures 5.4 m from top to toe and combines several techniques of production, including scraping, smoothing and deep engraving of the outlines.

        Each giraffe has an incised line emanating from its mouth or nose, meandering down to a small human figure. This motif is not unusual in Saharan rock art, but its meaning remains a mystery. Interpretations have suggested the line may indicate that giraffe were hunted or even domesticated, or may reflect a religious, mythical or cultural association. It has also been suggested that the lines and human figures were later additions.

        The engravings cannot be seen from ground level; they are only visible by climbing onto the boulder. They are thought to date from between 6,000 and 8,000 years ago – a period known as the Neolithic Subpluvial, when environmental conditions were much wetter and the Sahara was a vast savannah stretching for thousands of miles, able to sustain large mammals such as giraffe. The soft sandstone is likely to have been incised using a harder material such as flint; there are chisels of petrified wood in the surrounding desert sands which would have acted as good tools for abrading and polishing outlines. It is easy to imagine people in the past sitting on the rocky outcrop watching these long-necked, graceful animals and immortalising them in stone for future generations.

        We can only speculate as to why the giraffe was selected for this special treatment. Any number of physical, behavioural, environmental or symbolic factors may have contributed to its significance.

        While the giraffe have taken centre stage at this site because of their size and the skill of the execution, a systematic study of the area has identified 828 further engravings, including 704 zoomorphs (animal forms), 61 anthropomorphs (human forms), and 17 inscriptions of Tifinâgh script. The animals identified include: bovines (cattle ) (46%), ostrich (16%), antelope and gazelle (16%), giraffe (16%), and finally 12 dromedaries (camels), 11 canids (dog-like mammals), 6 rhinoceros, 3 equids (horses or donkeys), 2 monkeys, 2 elephants, and 1 lion.

        Who might the artists have been? It is often the case in rock art research that artists are lost to us in time and we have little or no archaeological evidence that can offer insights into the populations that occupied these sites, sometimes only for a short time. However, in 2001 a site called Gobero was discovered that provides a glimpse of life in this region at the time that the Dabous engravings were produced.

        150 km south-east of the Aïr Mountains. Situated on the edge of a paleaolake
        and dating from the early Holocene (7,700–6,200 years ago), it is the earliest
        recorded cemetery in the western Sahara and consists of around 200 burials.
        Skeletal evidence shows both male and females to be tall in stature, approaching
        two metres. Some of the burials included items of jewellery, including a young
        girl wearing a bracelet made from the tusk of a hippo, and a man buried with
        the shell of a turtle.

        points and hooks, as well as ceramics with dotted wavy-line and zig-zag impressed

        at the time of the engravings.

        result of human intervention such as trampling, graffiti and fragments being
        stolen. As a result, the decision was made to preserve them by making a mould
        of the carvings in order to make a cast in a resistant material. Permission
        was granted by both the government of Niger and UNESCO and in 1999 the moulding
        process took place. The first cast of the mould, made in aluminium, stands
        at the airport of Agadez in the small desert town near the site of Dabous
        – an enduring symbol of the rich rock art heritage of the country.

        Historically, much of the rock art from across northern Africa has been classified according to a particular style or ‘school’ of depictions. One such category of images, known as the Libyan Warrior School or Libyan Warrior style is found predominantly in Niger. Typically, this style

        “…commonly depicts human figures, mainly armed warriors; women are very rare. The style is fairly crude and the technique unsophisticated, almost invariably a rather careless pecking. The figures, almost always presented frontally with their heads quite circular, with added lobes, or mushroom-shaped, are shown according to a symmetrical schema. Various garment decorations and feathers in the hair are common, and the warrior often holds one or two throwing-spears – the bow is almost lacking – and frequently also holds by the leading rein a typical horse; foreshortened with large hindquarters” (Muzzolini, 2001:614)

        Termed *Libyan Warriors* by French ethnographer Henri Lhote, these representations have been associated with Garamantes’ raids, possibly 2,500 years ago. Thought to be descended from Berbers and Saharan pastoralists who settled in central Libya from around 1500 BC, the Garamantes developed a thriving urban centre, with flourishing trade networks from Libya to Niger. In contrast, Francis Rodd, a military man who led two big expeditions to the Sahara in the 1920s, proposed that these figures represent Tuareg; a people reputedly of Berber descent who live a nomadic pastoralist lifestyle. They have their own script known as Tifinagh, which is thought to have Libyan roots and which is engraved onto rocks alongside other rock art depictions.

        Libyan Warrior figures are almost exclusively located in the Aïr Mountains of Niger although can also be found in the Adrar des Iforas, north-east Mali extending into Algeria.  Defining the Libyan Warrior Period chronologically is a challenge and dates are fairly fluid; the earliest dates suggested start from 5,200 years ago; it certainly coincides with the Horse period between 3,000-2,000 years ago but has also been proposed to continue throughout the Camel Period, from 2,000 years ago to present.

        From the sample of images we have as part of this collection it is clear that not all figures designated as falling under the umbrella term of Libyan Warrior style all share the same characteristics; there are similarities, differences and adjacencies even between what we may term a ‘typical’ representation. Of course, if these images span a period of 5,000 years then this may account for the variability in the depictions.

      body: However, for the majority of figures their posture is remarkably similar
        even though objects of material culture and the types of garments they wear
        may show more diversity. The overriding feature is that figures are positioned
        frontally with arms bent and raised, often displaying splayed fingers. In
        some cases figures hold weapons and shields, but some do not. Some wear obviously
        elaborate headdresses, but in others the features look more coiffure-like.
        Selected garments are decorated with geometric patterns, others are plain;
        not all wear items of personal ornamentation. Certainly, not all figures are
        associated with horses, as typically characterised. Moreover, rather than
        all being described as unsophisticated or careless, many are executed showing
        great technique and skill. So how do we start to make sense of this contradiction
        between consistency and variation?

      body: A criticism of Saharan rock art research, in comparison to that which
        has focused on other parts of Africa, is an under-theorisation of how the
        art links to past ethnic, archaeological or other identities (Smith,2013:156).
        This is tricky when dealing with past societies which were potentially nomadic,
        and where their archaeological remains are scarce. However, recent anthropological
        research may inform our thinking in this area. A member of the Wodaabe cultural
        group (nomadic cattle-herders and traders in the Sahel) on seeing a photograph
        of a Libyan-Warrior engraving and noting the dress and earrings told photographer
        Carol Beckwith that it represents a woman performing a traditional greeting
        dance with arms outstretched and about to clap (Coulson and Campbell,2001:210).

      body: "Such a comment suggests that local ethnographies might assist in an understanding
        of more recent rock art, that not all figures described as Libyan-Warrior
        may necessarily be the same; and indeed that women may not be as rare as previously
        documented. In fact, the Wodaabe have been noted to resemble figures in other
        Saharan rock art contexts (see article on Hairdressing in the Acacus).\n\nIf
        we accept that some of these representations share affinities with the Wodaabe
        then thinking about this category of images from an ethnographic perspective
        may prove productive. Moreover, the British Museum’s existing ethnographic
        collections are simultaneously a useful resource by which we can potentially
        add more meaning to the rock art images.\n\nThe Wodaabe belong to the Fulani
        people, numbering 20 million and currently living across eighteen countries.
        The Wodaabe comprise 2-3% of the Fulani cultural group, still live as true
        nomads and are considered to have the most traditional culture of all the
        Fulani (Bovin,2001:13).\t\n"

      body: "The Wodaabe have become particularly well-known in the West through visual
        anthropology, because of their emphasis on cultivating male personal beauty
        and adornment. Men invest enormous amounts of time in personal artistic expression;
        much more so than women. Anthropologists have documented the constant checking
        of Wodaabe men in their mirrors; a Wodaabe man will not even go out among
        the cows in the morning until he has checked and tidied himself. They spend
        hours every day on their appearance and have been described as styling themselves
        like “living paintings” and “living statues” (Bovin, 2001:72). Symmetry plays
        a particularly significant part in Wodaabe culture and is reflected in all
        their artistic expressions. Symmetry stands for culture, asymmetry stands
        for nature. Culture is order and nature is disorder (Bovin,2001:17). Everyday
        Wodaabe life is imbued with artistic expression, whereby “every individual
        is an active creator, decorator and performer (Bovin, 2001:15).\n\nSo, how
        might we see Wodaabe cultural traits reflected in the Libyan-Warrior figures?\n\nPlumage
        is often depicted on these Warrior figures and for the most part is assumed
        to simply be part of the warrior regalia. The ostrich feather, a phallic symbol
        in Wodaabe culture, is an important element in male adornment and is carefully
        placed in the axis of symmetry in the middle of a man’s turban, worn during
        dancing ceremonies (Bovin, 2001:41). Music and dancing are typical of Fulani
        traditions, characterized by group singing and accompanied by clapping, stomping
        and bells. The feathers in the British Museum’s collections are known to be
        dance ornaments, worn during particular ceremonies. \n"

        that seem to be suspended from a figure’s arm or shoulder. Historically, these
        have been interpreted as shields, which one might expect a warrior to be carrying
        and in part this may be the case.

        used as vessel covers or food trays; both of which are vital items in a nomadic
        lifestyle. Alternatively, they may represent calabashes. Wodaabe women measure
        their worldly wealth in calabashes and can acquire many in a lifetime, mostly
        ornamental to be displayed only on certain ceremonial occasions. If some of
        these depictions are not necessarily men or warriors then what have been considered
        shields may in fact represent some other important item of material culture.

        There is also a consensus within Wodaabe society about beauty and ugliness; what makes something beautiful or indeed ugly generally is agreed upon, there is a commonality of taste. This may account for the paradox of why there is individuality within a corpus of images that inherently are comparable (Bovin,2001:16).

        As nomads, Wodaabe do not identify themselves by place or territory as such, but a Wodaabe’s body is a repository of culture to mark them out against nature. Culture is not seen as an unessential indulgence but as an imperative necessity, it is part of one’s survival and existence in an inhospitable environment. We may speculate that rock art images may be seen as a way of stamping culture on nature; markers of socialised space.

      body: This brief review was motivated, in part, by the underlying problems inherent
        in the categorisation of visual culture. Historically assigned classifications
        are not fixed and armed with current knowledge across a range of resources
        we may provide further insights into these enigmatic representations. Obviously,
        a much more systematic study of this category known as Libyan-Warrior figures
        needs to be undertaken to determine their distribution and the similarities
        and differences between depictions across sites. Additionally, care must be
        taken making connections with a cultural group whose material culture has
        changed over the course of the twentieth century. Nevertheless, it seems the
        category of Libyan-Warrior figures is an area that is ripe for more intensive
        investigation.

      title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 1'
      body: Niger is geographically diverse, having both the Sahel (savannah) and
        the Sahara (desert). The majority of the country’s rock art – made up predominantly
        of engravings – is located in the northern desert area, in and around the
        Aïr Mountains, where some of the art is thought to be several thousand years
        old. The Djado Plateau in the north-east is also rich in art that includes
        both paintings and engravings. One of the most celebrated sites of rock engraving
        is at a place called Dabous, to the west of the mountains. Here, two life-size
        giraffe were carved on the top of an outcrop, and may be up to 6,000 years
        old. Other notable areas for engravings are Iwellene in the northern Aïr Mountains,
        where some of the art is thought to be several thousand years old, as well
        the sites of Tanakom and Tagueit in the south-eastern Aïr Mountains, where
        engravings are located on the sides of two wadis (dry riverbeds).

        found in the Aïr Mountains and the rock engravings of the Adrar des Iforas
        in Mali. Stylistic similarities also exist with some of the art of the Tadrart
        (Acacus) and in south-east Algeria. Further associations have been made between
        the Early Hunter art of the Djado Plateau and art in south-west Libya and
        south-east Algeria. Equally, similarities have been observed with the Tazina-style
        engravings in south-western Algeria and south-eastern Morocco.

      body: Consisting predominantly of engravings, the majority of depictions in
        this region fall within the so-called Libyan Warrior period or style of art,
        dating from 1,500–3,000 years ago, characterised by forward-facing figures
        with metal weapons and horses. Approximately 1,000 engravings of warriors
        have been recorded from the Aïr Mountains in Niger, as well as the Adrar des
        Iforas in bordering Mali. Based on investigations into the garments worn,
        accessories, headdresses and weaponry, and by studying the placement and superimposition
        of images, it has been proposed that there are two main stages of this Libyan
        Warrior rock art. The oldest is linked to a pastoral economy based on cattle-rearing,
        when metal had been introduced to the region and the use of the spear took
        over from the traditional bow. This region also hosts images of wild animals
        such as Barbary sheep and ostrich, as well as cattle.

        Tassili n’Ajjer, Algeria. Moreover, Henri Lhote noted the resemblance between
        these rock art depictions and the husbandry practices of the present day Wodaabe
        people of Niger, who use a similar calf rope. The calf rope (a long rope comprising
        loops within which the heads of the calves are secured) is both practical
        and symbolic, ensuring the cows always return to their home camp, while also
        physically dividing the camp into male and female halves. It is interesting
        to note the close relationship between the rock art of regions that today
        are politically discrete.

      title: History of rock art discovery in Niger
      title_internal: 'Niger: country, chapter 7'
      body: Until relatively recently rock art research has been sporadic in Niger.
        In the 1920s Major Gen. Francis Rodd, a British explorer and army officer,
        made two great expeditions into the Sahara. He was the first person to make
        a serious study of the Tuareg and documented some of the rock art in the Aïr
        Mountains. Subsequently, French colonial officers noted some sites around
        1960. However, it was French archaeologist Henri Lhote who undertook major
        recording programmes throughout the 1960s and 1970s to document, trace and
        publish several thousand engravings. Very little information is known relating
        the rock art to known cultural groups, either past or present. Most of the
        sites were not habitation sites, and were probably only occasionally visited
        by nomadic societies in the past, so very little (if any) archaeological evidence
        remains. Most of the art predates the residence of the Tuareg, who now inhabit
        this area and who appear to have no direct connections with the art. The Tuareg
        recognise old script which sometimes accompanies images as it closely resembles
        their own writing, *Tifinagh*; however, it is incomprehensible to them if
        it is more than 100 years old.

        are depicted in a similar fashion to the big game of the Early Hunter Period,
        which raises the question of whether the nomadic cattle-herding culture emerged

      body: Engravings in the Tazina style are found on the Djado Plateau and have
        been likened to those in south-eastern Morocco. While dates in Niger are not
        generally agreed, the Tazina period in Morocco is dated from c.5,000–2,000
        BC.

      body: Consisting predominantly of rock engravings and found in the Aïr Mountains,
        the Horse Period and Libyan Warrior Period date from around 3,000–1,500 years
        ago. Depictions are of horses with so-called Libyan Warriors, with metal weapons
        or with chariots and charioteers. Human figures, which often appear with horses,
        were sometimes depicted with elaborate apparel; others were drawn with stylized
        bodies consisting of two triangles joined at the apex. Wild animals such as
        Barbary sheep and ostrich, as well as cattle, appear in this art. Art of the
        Horse Period is not widely represented in the Djado Plateau, suggesting that
        Berber groups did not reach the region in any great numbers – but it has been
        proposed that certain peculiarities of style may suggest an influence from
        Aïr.

      body: A small number of engravings from the Camel Period occur on the Djado
        Plateau, but as camels were introduced to the Sahara up to 2,000 years ago,
        the relative lack of depictions suggests that the plateau was scarcely frequented
        during this hyper-arid period.
