      body: 'Lake Victoria is the largest lake in Africa, and at 69,484km², the second
        largest in the world by surface area.   Sitting in a depression in the plateau
        between the eastern and western valley branches of the geological East African
        Rift System, its shores are in Uganda, Tanzania, and to the south-east, in
        Kenya.   Mfangano Island, rising 300m out of the lake near the Kenyan shore,
        is home to some of the most prominent rock painting sites in the country,
        featuring abstract patterned paintings thought to have been created between
        1,000 and 4,000 years ago by  hunter-gatherers.   The rock paintings on Mfangano
        Island are found at two principal sites:  in a cave near the sea known as
        Mawanga, and at a rock shelter further inland called Kwitone.'

      body: Mawanga is a roughly triangular limestone cavern, about 18m wide across
        the mouth and 12m deep.  The roof slopes sharply to the back towards a raised
        platform against the rear of the left wall, on which 12 images of concentric
        circles and spirals in white and red have been painted. Kwitone has similar
        paintings, situated at one end of a long overhang in a sandstone cliff, below
        the shoulder of a ridge.  The rock art at Kwitone is at the far end on the
        shelter wall, several metres above a cleared floor section. The paintings
        here feature 11 distinct shapes including concentric circles and oblongs.
        One of these is a prominent sunburst pattern in brown, with rays emanating
        from the outermost band. The images are larger than those at Mawanga, averaging
        around 40cm in diameter, and less faded, exhibiting more brown pigment, although
        both sites appear to reflect the same artistic tradition. These are finger
        paintings, with pigment probably made of haematite or white clay mixed with
        a natural binder such as egg white or urine. There is evidence that the surface
        may also have also been prepared prior to painting, by polishing, and that
        some of the images may have reapplied or retouched over time.

      body: The circular shapes seen here are typical of an apparent wider East and
        Central African rock art tradition featuring a preponderance of circular motifs,
        usually attributed to people known as the Batwa, a Bantu-origin name for  a
        series of culturally related groups historically living around Africa’s Great
        Lakes region and more widely throughout Central Africa.  Like the San people,
        who are known to have been the creators of most of the famous rock art of
        Southern Africa, Batwa were traditionally hunter-gatherers, and are considered
        the most ancient indigenous populations of the area. In the early 20th century,
        it was proposed that East African rock art of this tradition could have been
        the work of ancestral San people, but it is now generally assumed to be of
        Batwa origin with, for example, possible parallels to be seen in the symbolic
        iconography with contemporary barkcloth designs of the related Mbuti people
        from the Democratic Republic of Congo (Namono, 2010).

      body: 'Further examples of apparently Batwa origin rock art can be seen in neighbouring
        Uganda and Tanzania, a reminder that contemporary political borders do not
        reflect physical partitions in the spatial coverage of rock art traditions.  Lolui
        Island, about 50km north west of Mfangano Island and  in Ugandan waters, is
        another important Lake Victoria rock art environment, featuring both painting
        sites and rock gongs (sonorous natural percussive instruments with the wear
        of use) which seem to be associated with the painting sites. There are also
        numerous sets of cupules—ground circular depressions in the rocks.  Some of
        these are referred to locally as Omweso, due to their bearing some resemblance
        to  the depressions used for holding gaming pieces in the so-named local variant
        of the Mancala-type board games played widely throughout eastern Africa.  However,
        their original significance and use is unknown.   Cupule sites are also found
        on the Kenyan mainland and on Mfangano island.  Many of these are clearly
        anthropogenic, however an unusual phenomenon is to be noted in the spectacular
        array of naturally formed cupule-like depressions in the limestone of Mawanga
        cave. This may remind us to exercise caution in ascribing ‘rock art’ status
        to all apparently patterned rock formations. The cause of these multitudinous
        small depressions is so far unknown. '

      body: 'The rock art sites of the eastern Lake Victoria region retain spiritual
        connotations for the communities living around them, even if their denoted
        modern significance differs from that envisioned by the original artists.
        The modern inhabitants of Mfangano Island are the Abasuba people, a Bantu
        language-speaking group unrelated to the Batwa who have nevertheless appropriated
        the sites as arenas of spiritual importance.  Members of the Wasamo clan in
        the area around Mawanga remember their having used the site for rain making
        rituals until a few decades ago, with red and white pigment apparently representing
        the moon and sun respectively.  Soot on the cave roof may indicate other recent
        human activity there. When the archaeologist James Chaplin—who first investigated
        the Kwitone site in the 1960s—visited it later, he was told by local Wagimbe
        clan people that they also held the paintings there to be associated with
        some taboos, and connected it with ancestor worship. These beliefs reflect
        events of the recent past, as the Abasuba only moved into the area in the
        last 400 years.  This followed an earlier occupation by Luo peoples, prior
        to which habitation by the Batwa is assumed. The local importance of the sites
        is highlighted in their stewardship by the Abasuba Peace Museum, which fosters
        a continuing relationship with the sites and those who live around them. '

      body: Rock art is distributed widely throughout Kenya, although historically
        rock art research has not been as extensive as in neighbouring countries such
        as Tanzania. Some of Kenya's various rock art traditions are attributed to
        or associated with the ancestors of modern regional cultural groups, and as
        such sites sometimes retain local religious importance. Both painted and engraved
        imagery tends towards the symbolic and geometric, with occasional depictions
        of schematic animals and people. It must be noted that there are still probably
        many Kenyan rock art sites which have not yet become known outside of their
        local communities, if they are known at all.

      body: Kenya covers about 569,140km², bordering Ethiopia and Somalia in the north
        and east and Tanzania and Uganda in the south and west. The country stretches
        from a low-lying eastern coastal strip, inland to highland regions in the
        west of the country. Kenya's western half is divided by the eastern section
        of the East African Rift, the long area of tectonic divergence which runs
        from the coasts of Djibouti, Eritrea and Somalia down through Ethiopia and
        Kenya and into Uganda, curving around the eastern edge of the Lake Victoria
        basin. There are a significant number of painted rock art sites throughout
        west-central and southern Kenya.

      title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 3'
      body: 'Although researchers had been noting and investigating rock art in the
        neighbouring countries of Tanzania and Uganda from the early years of the
        20th Century, the first published mention of Kenyan rock art appeared only
        in 1946, with Joy Adamson''s descriptions of engravings at Surima, in the
        northern Turkana region. It was in the 1960s that sustained academic attention
        began to be paid to other sites in the country. In 1961 Richard Wright published
        an account of a rock shelter (now known as Kiptogot Cave) with painted images
        of cattle on the slopes of Mount Elgon near Kitale. Wright suggested potential
        parallels in style with some Ethiopian pastoralist rock art. In 1968 Robert
        Soper was the first archaeologist to investigate the unique Namoratung’a burial
        sites to the east of Lake Turkana, with their engraved standing stones, the
        interpretation of which would be continued with the work of Mark Lynch and
        Lawrence Robbins in the 1970s. In the same decade significant painting sites
        at Lake Victoria, north of the lake near the Ugandan border, and in the far
        south were also reported on by James Chaplin, Osaga Odak and Richard Gramly.
        Research and discovery has continued and is likely that many rock art sites
        in Kenya remain to be documented. As recently as 2005, 21 previously unknown
        rock art sites in the Samburu area of central Kenya were recorded during dedicated
        survey work organised by the British Institute in East Africa.    '

      title: Themes
      title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 4'
      body: "Figurative imagery only features prominently in about 10% of the known
        rock art sites of Kenya.  That which exists tends to consist of very schematic
        images of cattle, wild animals and people. The majority of both painted and
        engraved rock art iconography throughout Kenya comprises symbols, with common
        patterns including circles, sometimes concentric or containing crosses, spirals,
        parallel or cross-hatched lines and curvilinear shapes.  Circular ground  depressions
        in the rock surface, known as cupules, are also a common variant of rock art
        in Kenya, along with rock gongs, which show evidence of the use of natural
        rock formations as percussive instruments.\n\nInterpretation, cultural attribution
        and proposed dates for these works vary widely across technique and area,
        although there are common themes.  It has been suggested that the schematic
        nature and similarities in the art may point to shared East African symbolic
        understandings common to different cultural groups, for example equating circular
        shapes (some of the most popular motifs in Eastern and Central African rock
        art in general) with chieftainship or the sun, or acting as navigation devices.\n\nGiven
        the variations in distance, age and nature of the sites, there is a danger
        of generalising, but there are factors which may contribute to more incisive
        interpretations of specific sites and symbols.  One set of interpretations
        for geometric shapes in Kenyan rock art points to the similarities of certain
        of these symbols to cattle brands used by Nilotic peoples throughout Kenya,
        including the Turkana, Samburu and Masai groups.  Although the engravings
        at Namoratung'a are not thought to have been made by ancestral Turkana people,
        Lynch and Robbins noted the similarities of some of the symbols found there
        to contemporary local Turkana cattle brands.  These symbols are pecked on
        stones at graves containing mens’ remains and have been proposed to represent
        male lineages, as animal brands traditionally do in contemporary Nilotic ethnic
        groups. Further south, it is known that some more recent rock paintings representing
        brand and shield patterns were made by  Masai and Samburu men, in shelters
        used for meat-feasting—a  practice forbidden in their home compounds after
        their formal initiation as warriors—or as initiation sites. Actual representations
        of cattle are rare, with the vibrant paintings at Kakapel near the Ugandan
        border the most reknowned. Their creators are unknown although Masai and Samburu
        have been known to paint occasional schematic cattle in the past.    \n"

      title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 5'
      body: Not all of Kenya's rock art is associated with pastoralists. Much of the
        symbolic art, particularly to the south and west, is attributed to the ’Batwa’,
        ancestors of modern Batwa and related, traditionally hunter-gatherer cultural
        groups living around the Great Lakes Region of East and Central Africa.  Circular
        designs and “Sunburst” symbols are some of the most common motifs usually  associated
        with the Batwa rock art tradition; it has been proposed that they may have
        been associated  with fertility or rainmaking. Some rock art on Mfangano Island,
        in the Kenyan portion of Lake Victoria, has retained the latter association,
        having been used until the recent past by local Abasuba people for rainmaking
        purposes, despite their not having produced it originally. This re-use of
        symbolic sites in Kenya and the difficulty of dating further confuses the
        question of attribution for the art. The same rock art sites used by different
        cultural groups at different times and for different reasons. Such is the
        case at Kakapel for example, where it is posited that the earliest paintings
        may be hunter-gatherer in origin, with more recent cattle images added later,
        and Namoratung’a, with some engravings apparently hundreds of years old and
        others made within the last century.

      body: It is instructive to consider the use of rock art sites within their physical
        contexts as well as the rock art motifs themselves.  Locality and landscape
        are significant, for example at Namoratung’a, where the engraved basalt pillars
        at a related nearby site have been posited to be positioned according to astronomical
        calculations, based on an ancient Cushitic calendar.  There are various ways
        in which the creation and continued use of sites in Kenya may have been significantly
        interactive, such as in the ritual playing of rock gongs, or in the potential
        use of rows of cupules as gaming boards for forms of Mancala, a token game
        common through central and Southern Africa which was originally introduced
        to Kenya via Indian Ocean trade.  It is not known if cupules were actually
        created for this purpose—it has been suggested for example that  in some areas,
        cupules were formed for purely practical purposes, in the pulverising of food
        or materials for smelting activities. In Kenya, as elsewhere, what actually
        constitutes rock art is not always easy to identify.

      title: Chronology
      title_internal: 'Kenya: country, chapter 7'
      body: "Rock art ascribed to Batwa peoples could be anywhere between 15,000-1,000
        years old, while pastoralist art is more recent.  Radiocarbon dating of rock
        art is difficult unless it is buried and associated with other uncontaminated
        organic remains and as such, scientifically dated rock art from Kenya is rare.
        \ Radiocarbon dates from human remains in graves at Namoratung’a South date
        from the mid-1st Century BC to the mid-1st Millennium AD, but as dates like
        these are not directly relatable to the rock art, researchers have tended
        to concentrate on assigning chronologies based on varying levels of patination
        and style, without being able to ascribe more than estimated production dates.
        \ \n\nThere are occasionally defining limits which aid in dating  specific
        sites, for example, cattle did not arrive in Eastern Africa until about 2,000
        BC, so representations of cattle must postdate this.  In addition, in some
        cases, artworks known to have been associated with certain groups cannot have
        been produced prior to, or post, certain dates for political reasons. For
        example, Masai paintings at Lukenya Hill are known to have been painted prior
        to 1915, as Masai people were displaced from this area by European settlers
        after this date.  \n\nThe diversity of Kenyan rock art in motif, distribution
        and cultural context so far frustrates any attempts for a cohesive chronology,
        but the continuing local engagement with rock art sites in Kenya can potentially
        serve as a useful dating and interpretive resource for researchers alongside
        continuing archaeological research."
