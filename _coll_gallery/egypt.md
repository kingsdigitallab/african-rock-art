        by side in the southern part of the Gilf Kebir plateau in Egypt’s Western
        Desert, an area so remote and inaccessible that its existence only became
        known to European cartographers in 1926. It is so named due to the human figures
        painted on its walls with their limbs contorted as if swimming. It has since
        become world-renowned, particularly as a key location in the feature film
        *The English Patient* (1996), based on Michael Ondaatje’s novel of the same
        name.

      body: The book and film feature fictionalised versions of the cave and its real-life
        discoverer, László Almásy, as the title character. In reality, Almásy was
        a charismatic figure in pre-war Saharan exploration. He argued that the ‘swimming’
        figures suggested the prior existence of abundant water in the area and was
        therefore evidence that it had not always been arid desert, a radical new
        theory at the time that has since been confirmed, although not on the basis
        of these paintings as evidence. Rock art is notoriously difficult to date
        as it was a tradition practiced for thousands of years. These paintings have
        been dated at between 9,000 and 6,000 years ago, although some researchers
        have suggested both earlier and later dates.

        the rock faces in the form of graffiti, and in the surrounding sand, where
        the tracks from previous parties (including Almásy’s) lie undisturbed, adding
        to the sense of history: not only of those who produced the paintings, but
        also of the site itself. Meanwhile the condition of the paintings, prone to
        flaking, continues to deteriorate, further obscuring this tantalising glimpse
        into the past.'

      body: The rock art of Egypt was largely unknown outside of the region until
        the beginning of the 20th century. The rock paintings and engravings of Egypt
        feature a range of subjects and styles, including domestic cattle, wild animals,
        humans, boat images and inscriptions. Much of the rock art appears to date
        from within the last 8,000 years. However, earlier Palaeolithic engravings
        have also been found near the Nile, suggesting a longer time frame for the
        practice. The majority of Egypt’s most famous rock art, including the ‘Cave
        of Swimmers’, is found in the desert in the far south-west of the country.

        The presence of rock art in Egypt has been noticed by European scholars since the early 19th century. Geographically isolated from the bulk of rock art in the country, the paintings and engravings of Gilf Kebir and Jebel Uweinat were first catalogued in the 1920s by the Egyptian explorers and public figures Hassanein Bey and Prince Kemal el Dine, and thereafter by renowned early twentieth century explorers and ethnographers such as László Almásy, Leo Frobenius, Ralph Bagnold and Abbé Breuil, whose expeditions helped bring Saharan rock art into wider public consciousness.

        Hans Winkler’s seminal *Rock Drawings of Southern Upper Egypt* (1938-9) was one of the first regional catalogues and remains a pre-eminent review of finds. Further cataloguing of rock art images and sites in the southern Nile valley took place at the time of the construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s. Where rock art historically was part of larger archaeological research in the area, in recent years it has been subject to more direct and rigorous study which will contribute to a better understanding of chronologies and relationships.

      body: In desert areas, recognisably stylised Pharaonic-period inscriptions and
        engravings from between 3,100 and 30 BC can be found on rock faces, particularly
        at oases and quarry sites such as Kharga Oasis and Wadi Hammamat in the Western
        and Eastern deserts. There is also rock art from later periods like that at
        Matna el-Barqa in the Western Desert hinterland, where both Pharaonic and
        later Coptic inscriptions mix with images of gods and horsemen. Earlier examples
        of engraved rock art may be found in the Nile valley, in what is now southern
        Egypt and northern Sudan, linked to progenitors of ancient Egyptian cultures,
        most particularly the people of the Naqada Periods (4,000-3,100 BC). This
        art is characterised by frequent depictions on pottery of river boats, which
        occur in much of the rock art near the Nile, and include, pecked on a boulder
        at Nag el-Hamdulab near Aswan, what is considered the first known depiction
        of a Pharaoh, on just such a boat. Also prevalent in these areas are numerous
        engravings of animals and human figures.

      body: Possible links between ancient Egyptian culture and wider Saharan rock
        art traditions have been discussed since the rock art of northern Africa first
        met European academic attention in the early 20th century. Although the arid
        Western Desert appears to have been a significant barrier, relations remain
        unclear.

      title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 6'
      body: Certainly, not all rock art found in Egypt has direct links to Pharaonic
        cultures. Recently, the rock art at Qurta, south of Edfu, of naturalistic
        outline engravings of ancient aurochs (ancestors of domestic cattle), were
        dated reliably to the Palaeolithic Period, between 16,000 and 15,000 years
        ago, making them the oldest known rock art in northern Africa. Between the
        eighth and fourth millennia BC, Egypt’s climate was generally temperate, interrupted
        only briefly by dry spells, until the increasing aridity thereafter concentrated
        life in the Eastern Sahara around the river’s banks.

      body: This development fostered both ancient Egyptian culture and isolated populations
        of animals elsewhere driven out of their environments by encroaching desert,
        some of which, like crocodiles, are represented in the rock engravings found
        along the alluvial plains. Engravings of wild fauna continue to be uncovered,
        such as that recently found near the Farafra Oasis, with depictions of giraffe
        and antelope scratched into the rock face. In a cave nearby, alongside engraved
        lion paw prints, are blown-pigment negative paintings of human hands.

      title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 8'
      body: Some of Egypt’s most striking and famous rock art is found far from the
        Nile at Gilf Kebir, a vast sandstone plateau in the desert near the Libyan
        border. As elsewhere in the Sahara, there are frequent depictions of domestic
        cattle, people and wild animals. Like most rock art, the paintings and engravings
        here are hard to date accurately but may refer to the ‘Bovidian Period’ (Pastoral
        Period) rock art of the wider Sahara, typified by paintings and engravings
        of cattle and people (Huyge, 2009). However, the scholarly community recognises
        the inherent difficulty of formulating conclusions of direct links with wider
        rock art practices. Some evidence of pastoralists in the area means that this
        rock art could have been made as early as the fifth millennium BC and are
        thus possibly contemporaneous with Predynastic Egyptian cultures, but not
        necessarily connected (Riemer, 2013).

      title: Interpretation
      title_internal: 'Egypt: country, chapter 9'
      body: The motivation behind producing these images remains elusive. Where a
        particular cosmology is better known, it can be speculated, such as the Nile
        boat paintings have been suggested to evoke funerary beliefs and practices.
        If nothing else, the cattle paintings of Gilf Kebir demonstrate the importance
        of cattle in the pastoralist culture that produced them. Despite still being
        relatively little known, the ‘mystique’ behind rock art has cultivated popular
        curiosity, in particular in Gilf Kebir’s famous ‘Cave of Swimmers’. This is
        a shallow rock shelter featuring many painted human figures in strange contortions,
        as if swimming – images which have captured the popular imagination, with
        their glimpse of life in Egypt millennia before the Pharaohs and their hints
        at a watery Sahara.
