      body: Laas Geel, one of the most important rock art sites in the region, is
        located in the north-western part of the Horn of Africa, in Somaliland, in
        the road that links Hargeisa and Berbera. The site is placed on a granite
        outcrop that rises from a plateau at an altitude of 950 meters above sea level,
        at the confluence of two seasonal rivers, a key fact to explain the existence
        of rock art in the outcrop. Even today, the name of the site (“the camel’s
        well” in Somali) makes reference to the availability of water near the surface
        of the wadis. The panels are placed at three different levels and distributed
        mostly throughout the eastern flank of the outcrop, although isolated depictions
        can be found in other slopes.

      body: The site was discovered in 2002 by a French team led by Xavier Gutherz
        which studied the beginning of Pastoralism in the Horn of Africa. Along with
        the paintings, lithic tools were found scattered throughout the site, and
        tombs marked with stelae and mounds can be seen in the neighbourhood. The
        paintings are distributed along 20 rock shelters, the biggest being around
        10 meters long. Most of them correspond to humpless cows with curved or lyre-like
        white horns (sometimes with reddish tips) and marked udders. Paintings are
        enormously colourful, including red, white, black, violet, brown and yellow
        both isolated and combined. However, the most distinctive feature of these
        cows is their necks, depicted rectangular, abnormally wide and either blank
        or infilled with red and white stripes, either straight or wavy. These strange
        necks have been interpreted as mats hanging from the actual neck, in what
        could be interpreted as a ceremonial ornament.

        representation of herds can be made out, and they are often associated with
        human figures with a very standardized shape: frontally depicted with arms
        outstretched to the sides, and wearing a kind of shirt, usually white. Heads
        are small and sometimes surrounded by a halo of radial dashes as a crown.
        These figures always appear related to the cows, either under the neck, between
        the legs or behind the hindquarters. In some cases they carry a bow, a stick
        or a shield. Along with humans and cows, dogs are well represented too, usually
        positioned near the human figures. Other animals are much scarcer: there are
        some figures that could correspond to antelopes, monkeys and two lonely depictions
        of a giraffe. Throughout most of the panels, geometric symbols are also represented,
        often surrounding the cows.'

      body: Unlike many other rock art sites, Laas Geel has been dated quite precisely
        thanks to the excavations carried out in one of the shelters by the French
        team that documented the site. During the excavation parts of the painted
        rock wall were recovered, and therefore the archaeologists have proposed a
        chronology of mid-4th to mid-3rd millennia, being one of the oldest evidences
        of cattle domestication in the Horn of Africa and the oldest known rock art
        site in this region. Unfortunately, although bovine bones were recovered from
        the excavation, they were too poorly preserved to determine whether they correspond
        to domestic or wild animals.

      body: When discovered, Laas Geel was considered a unique site, and although
        its general characteristics corresponded to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabic
        style, its specific stylistic features had no parallels in the rock art of
        the region. As research has increased, some other sites, such as Dhaga Koure,
        Dhambalin and Karin Hagane, have provided similar depictions to those of Laas
        Geel, thus reinforcing the idea of a distinctive “Laas Geel” style which nevertheless
        must be interpreted within the broader regional context.

      title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 1'
      body: Somalia is a country located at the corner of the Horn of Africa, bordered
        by Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya. Somaliland self-declared independence from
        Somalia in 1991 although the government of Somalia has not recognised this
        and views it as an autonomous region. A cultural and economic crossroads between
        Middle East, Africa and Asia, this area has historically been the centre of
        trade routes that linked these regions. It also has a very rich rock art heritage
        which has only recently been started to be studied in depth. Most of the known
        depictions correspond to painted or engraved cattle scenes, often accompanied
        by human figures, dogs and other domestic animals, although some warriors,
        camels and geometric symbols (sometimes interpreted as tribal marks) are common
        too.

      body: 'The geography of Somaliland is characterized by a coastal semi-desert
        plain which runs parallel to the Gulf of Aden coast, crossed by seasonal rivers
        (wadis) which make possible some grazing during the rainy season. Farther
        to the south, this semi-desert plain gives rise to the Karkaar Mountains.
        These mountains, which run from Somaliland into the region of Puntland in
        Somalia, have an average height of 1800 meters above sea level and run west
        to east until Ras Caseyr (Cape Guardafui) where the north and east coasts
        of the Horn of Africa meet. Southward to the mountains there is a big, dry
        plateau known as the Ogo, whose western part (the Haud) is one of the few
        good grazing areas in the country. The Ogo plateau occupies much of central
        and eastern Somalia, which to the south is characterized by the two only permanent
        rivers in the country, the Jubba and the Shabeele, born in the Ethiopian highlands
        and running to the south. Regarding rock art, the distribution of the known
        rock art sites shows a high concentration in Somaliland, with only some sites
        located to the south in the Gobolka Hiiraan region. However, this distribution
        could be a result of lack of research in other areas. '

      title: Research history
      title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 3'
      body: A reconstruction of rock art research history is challenging due to its
        contemporary history. To begin with, during the colonial period the country
        was divided in three different territories (British, Italian and French) with
        very different trajectories, until 1960 when the British and Italian territories
        joined to create Somalia. In British Somaliland the first studies of rock
        art were carried out by Miles Burkitt and P.E. Glover in the 1940s, and the
        first general overview was published in 1954 by J.D. Clark, as a part of a
        regional synthesis of the Horn of Africa prehistory, followed by limited research
        done by Italians in the north-east region in the late 1950s. Since then, research
        has been limited, with some general catalogues published in the 1980s and
        1990s, although political instability has often prevented research, especially
        in the south-eastern region of Somalia. In fact, most rock art information
        comes from wider regional syntheses dedicated to the Horn of Africa.  In the
        early 2000’s the discovery of the Laas Geel site led to a renewed interest
        in rock art in Somaliland, which has allowed a more systematic study of archaeological
        sites. Nowadays, about 70 of these sites have been located only in this area,
        something which shows the enormous potential of rock art studies in the Horn
        of Africa.

      title: Themes
      title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 4'
      body: The rock art has traditionally been ascribed to the so-called Ethiopian-Arabican
        style, a term coined by Pavel Červiček in 1971 to remark the strong stylistic
        relationship between the rock art found in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian
        Peninsula. According to this proposal, there was a progressive evolution from
        naturalism to schematism, perceptible in the animal depictions throughout
        the region. Wild animals seem to be largely absent but for Djibouti, while
        cattle depictions seem to have been fundamental elsewhere, either isolated
        or in herds. Such is the case with rock art in this region, where cows and
        bulls are the most common depictions, in many cases associated to human figures
        in what seems to be reverential or ritual scenes. In some of the sites, such
        as Laas Geel, the necks of the cows have been decorated with complex geometric
        patterns interpreted as a kind of mat used in special occasions to adorn them.

        dogs, sheep, dromedaries), although to a much lesser extent. Wild animals
        are very rare, but giraffes have been documented in Laas Geel and elephants
        and antelopes in Tug Gerbakele, and lions are relatively common in the schematic,
        more modern depictions. Human figures also appear, either distributed in rows
        or isolated, sometimes holding weapons. Geometric symbols are also common,
        usually associated with other depictions. In Somalia, these symbols have often
        been interpreted as tribal or clan marks. With respect to techniques, both
        engraving and painting are common, although paintings seem to be predominant.

      title_internal: 'Somalia: country, chapter 6'
      body: As in many other places, the establishment of accurate chronologies for
        Somaliland rock art is challenging. In this case, the lack of long term research
        has made things more difficult, and most hypotheses have been based in stylistic
        approaches, analysis of depictions and a small set of radiocarbon data and
        archaeological excavations. According to this, the oldest depictions could
        be dated to between the mid-3rd and the 2rd millennium BC, although older
        dates have been proposed for Laas Geel. This phase would be characterized
        by humpless cows, sheep and goats as well as wild animals. These sites would
        indicate the beginning of domestication in this region, the cattle being as
        a fundamental pillar of these communities. From this starting point the relative
        antiquity of the depictions would be marked by a tendency to schematism, visible
        in the superimpositions of several rock art sites. The introduction of camels
        would mark a chronology of the end of the first millennium BC, while the date
        proposed for the introduction of zebus (humped cows) should be placed at between
        the 1st Centuries BC and AD.

      body: Since the 1st millennium BC human figures armed with lances, bows and
        shields start to appear alongside the cattle, in some cases distributed in
        rows and depicting fighting scenes against other warriors or lions. The moment
        when this last period of rock art ended is unknown, but in nearby Eritrea
        some of these figures were depicted with firearms, thus implying that they
        could have reached a relatively modern date.
